39,Our NYC Go To!,When visiting New York City| we choose to stay at the Hotel Giraffe because the rooms are well appointed and clean| the location superbly convenient| and the staff always goes above and beyond. We have been going for years and the standards have always been maintained.,
70,Great Central Location,Stayed here 4 nights with the family checking out colleges with our daughter. We had a king suite with a balcony.  Room was split up into 2 distinct areas. The front living area that had a queen size pullout couch that our daughter slept on - that wasn't your typical cheap mattress| very comfortable. Large TV screen mini fridge so you could stock it with food. Bathroom was spacious with plenty of space for all of our stuff. A separate bedroom with king size bed that had a closet and dresser for all of our clothing. Bonus closet in living room area that had 2 luggage racks and plush robes.  We were up on 9th floor but could still hear street traffic| we noticed a placard that listed free items upon request| one of them was ear plugs...so we had some brought up to the room| that…,
1,another great experience in NYC!,Our second visit to Hotel Giraffe this year was exceptional in every way| topping our first visit by one hostess/server in the lobby who remembered us from May| and was over-the-top in gracious hospitality. ,
15,Great hotel| fantastic location,We stayed for 7 days| business and leisure trip. Everything during our stay was perfect| staff was very friendly and helpful| particularly Gabriella. Rooms are big and much bigger to what we have experianced so far in NYC. Also surprisingly quiet for the Park ave location. Lot's of great restaurants and bars in the neighbourhood and lower prices than in midtown.Will be back for sure!,
5,perfect stay in NYC,this hotel is perfect| well located| just 2 blocks from the subway. you can walk to times square| union square. the staff is very helpful. the hotel offers drinks and snacks in the afternoon. I recommend,
14,2nd visit as good as the first.,We stayed at hotel Giraffe last year as well as last week. We returned because we were quite pleased with our previous stay. Everything about this hotel was/is spot on. Helpful and friendly staff| comfortable and quiet room| very convenient  location| good breakfast and happy hour options.   We are already planning our next return. ,
1,Great hotel; great service,We loved the cozy feel of Hotel Giraffe.  It was unlike big| busy| crowded NYC hotels we have stayed in on previous visits. The staff was very helpful and friendly| and even remembered certain preferences during our stay. We have already recommended it to friends and would definitely stay there again.,
193,Not a great experience,Stayed for six nights in late October. Pros: location. Great restaurants nearby| many attractions and subway at walking distance. Cons: costly| even by Manhattan standards. The breakfast is just basic. It is served in a relatively small space| so it is not unusual to have to wait for the seat. Besides| there are some essential items lacking| like cheeses and ham. Better quality products would also be appreciated. So consider staying anywhere else and getting your breakfast outside| you’ll probably spend much less and eat much better. Service is ok. Room was comfortable| but in my opinion not clean enough| needs some restoration and maintenance. Accommodation in Manhattan is extremely expensive| but it should make up for the money spent. My expectations were so high for this…,
1,2nd Stay Notes,This was our second time staying at the Giraffe.  We enjoyed the hotel very much the first time so we rebooked again 5 years later. We are glad we did as the hotel has even got better the second time around.  Now a continental breakfast and an evening wine and cheese.  The food was delicious and everyone we met from the hotel was extremely nice.  We don’t submit reviews often but in this case we think others would be happy to stay at this little oasis in the city,
26,Hospitality| hospitality| hospitality!,In my opinion| this is why they continue to get unbelievably strong responses from their guests . The hotel environment ( Lobby/rooms) aren’t uniquely special from any other Premium standard accommodation . However| everything else they offered most definitely was . From the cheese and wine laid out every evening | to the interactions with every paid employee that made me feel almost obligated to return here on my next visit. So | if you are after a very special guest experience while in New York ..... look no further !,
1,Hotel Stay,This is a great hotel| at a perfect location. Elevators are very slow| and break down. The morning breakfast and evening happy hour are wonderful amenities.   Eliminate the requirement for a 200 word minimum.,
3,Always Doing Everything Roght,I love The Giraffe.  My husband and myself stay here every time we come to  NYC.  Their staff goes out of their way to assist you in every way. The  big pros are the cocktail hour fro 5 till 8 -that’s helps you save a lot of money for drinks elsewhere and they have a wonderful breakfast spread with fruit| bagels|hard boiled eggs.  This also helps on spending money for breakfast.  The rooms are very nice.  We do get a suite that has a balacony a more extra space (sitting are) but we also have stayed I. Their guest rooms and those are very nice as well.  You can’t go wrong I staying here.  Already waiting for my next trip,
3,Great All Around Hotel,I went with a friend for a girls' weekend to NYC| and we chose this hotel based upon a recommendation from another friend.  The room was well-equipped with comfortable beds| the staff was friendly and attentive| the location was great| and the complimentary breakfast| snacks| and wine and cheese were a very nice touch.  I will stay here again for sure!,
1,All Around  Excellence,The room was great| the service was great and the staff went out of their way to make you feel special.  We came to New Your to celebrate our granddaughter's graduation.  The stay at the Giraffe certainly made the trip feel special for her.  Our experience was everything that we hoped it would be for her first trip to New York.  Can't wait to return and stay at the Giraffe.,
44,1-night getaway in NYC,We decided to spend a day and night in NYC over the Veteran’s Day weekend. So many options in hotels| but my wife remembered we stayed at the Hotel Giraffe before.  She remembered the great location and really unexpected happy hour. Really glad that she remembered because the hotel stay was great!  The hotel is located near Madison Sq. Park in the Flat Iron area of Midtown. About a 10 minute walk from Penn. Station and there are subway options close to the hotel. We loved this location because it’s only about a 10-min walk to Union Sq. and really not far at all to Greenwich Village. It’s in a really great location away from the craziness of Times Sq| etc.  Hotel staff was great. We valet the car for the night. It’s $45 for 24 hours| which I find to be very fair. My family and I…,
52,Fabulous but understated,Hotel Giraffe is like a gracious host: It makes hospitality look effortless. Everything is so quietly well-done| but never ostentatiously. Rooms are spotlessly clean| my number one requirement in a hotel. The location is great| with easy access to the 28th Street subway station.   Continental breakfasts are served in the lobby each morning. Offerings include toasted bagels| assorted pastries| cereal| freshly cut fruit| hard boiled eggs| juices| and coffee. Copies of The NY Times are abundant. Guests seem to enjoy just sitting there and relaxing. The pastries and hot coffee remain out all day. Cookies are put out later in the day. And late in the afternoon wine and cheese are served.   The beds and bed linens are extremely comfortable. Rooms are well insulated| i.e. you won’t…,
1,Excellent stay,Only from across the river but needed to stay in this part of town. The staff was really cool and helpful. The beds were really comfortable and happy hour and breakfast were awesome! Very good vibe in this hotel!,
8,Excellent location and service,Lovely staff and delicious lobby snacks all day! Wonderful restaurants outside the door on all sides. Will definitely make this our home base on our two next trips to New York City  isiting our son at nyu.,
1,Our 1st time in New York,The service was great and exceeded our expectations. Once we closed our balcony doors| we never heard one sound outside.  The room temperature controller in living room and bedroom was perfect. Having our continental breakfast delivered to our room was well worth the extra $5pp. You can walk around the hotel and you can eat a good breakfast. A restaurant that we took advantage of is right across the street. I highly recommend this place. It is in the middle of Everything you need. I do have a minor blah| the TV controller in both rooms can only be used if you're really close to tv.  The sensor doesn't work if your laying in bed or sitting on the couch.,
38,Hotel Giraffe - An Elegant and Gracious Boutique Hotel,I have stayed at the Hotel Giraffe a number of times on business. I have never been disappointed...and| in fact| I just come to love this little gem more and more each time I go. With lovely rooms| great amenities (free breakfast and happy hour)| and wonderful staff this hotel deserves the high marks it gets. Special shout-outs to Gaby and JR| Jose| Christian...and the ever-delightful Gabriela who handles the happy hour.  The staff always remembers me and my colleagues on arrival...makes it feel like we are visiting old friends| which I guess we ARE doing!,
323,Pleasant  without being Outstanding,This  is the most difficult review  I  have  ever written because of  the  variety of experiences the hotel  provided.  We  booked  because  Trip Advisor  advised that The Giraffet was  #1 in NYC. Having  stayed  for a total of 9 nights recently| I  find this  difficult to believe. So| how do I  rank it ?  Against  all hotels classy| expensive  5 star hotels in New York| it  probably only  gets 3 stars  but  against other 3 &4  star hotels| it would deserve  a higher  ranking. So| first the good  points: (1)  location. It is  near subway stations  and lots of restaurants etc; (2)  Staff -  very  friendly  and helpful| always welcoming; (3)  room  size - we  had a corner  suite  so a great size  for NYC  with a separate  lounge area and very comfortable bed (4)  evening  drinks…,
1,Fun one nighter in NYC,The hotel Giraffe is in a great location on Park ave.  Easy to walk to different areas and the restaurant Upland is across the street and is fabulous.  The staff was excellent and very helpful as was the morning breakfast in the lobby.  The hotel has a really great vibe and everyone has a great vibe as well.  The rooms are appointed nicely and I would highly recommend rather than staying at a large hotel chain.  I can't wait to go back! ,
2,Amazing,We stayed here for 4 nights whilst we took in the sights of NYC. we were upgraded to a suite on checkin and they had left us a bottle of prosecco for my husbands birthday. Room was warm| clean and comfortable. Breakfast was served in the foyer with plenty of pastries| bagels| fresh fruit and coffee to set you up for the day. Location was really central - close to subway and within easy walking distance of key tourist attractions| e.g. Empire State Building| Fifth Avenue.,
1,Flawless,"Everything about our stay from.start to finish was perfect. The entire staff was amazing and they really go out of their way to make every guest feel special.  Our king room with a.balcony was huge for NYC standards and it was great having such a spacious closet to store clothes and luggage. Breakfast and Happy Hour were the icing on the cake. We have definitely found our new ""go to"" hotel fo4 our trips to NYC!! Thank you Hotel Giraffe!!! Hope to see you again soon!!",
11,Stayed there many times and never been disappointed,NYC has many hotels| but Giraffe is a true gem. They have top tier service| hotel is very classy and warm| and comfortable and clean. I like the wine and cheese each evening| and breakfast is a nice touch as well. Guests that stay at the hotel are also calm and nice... location of it is perfect as well. We stay at giraffe often.. we tried other hotels in the are but none come close to the level of this one,
5,Perfect location with super nice and helpful staff,A nice warm hotel| very clean. Nice relatively spacious rooms (for NYC). The best thing is the extremely nice and helpful staff| without exceptions. There is a free breakfast and a 24/7 coffee and some biscuits or fruits. Excellent choice.,
7,Convenient and Gracious Stay,The Hotel Giraffe offered a warm| comfortable place to stay right in the heart of Manhattan. My room was comfortable and clean| with a delicious continental breakfast served in a welcoming lobby space on the first floor. While the hotel itself lacks a gym| it was a quick walk to the New York Sports Club without any charge for admission. I'd be glad to stay at this property in the future. My only disappointment? Wishing the designers had played up the giraffe theme in a more visible| consistent and fun way.,
265,Nice hotel in graet location,We spent four nights. Good size room and ample storage. Small bathroom but large countertops to put toiletries. Check in and check out was easy. Staff was helpful in printing boarding passes. Decent breakfast buffet. After a long day visiting we enjoyed the evening wine and cheese. Gabriella is such an efficient and warm person. She makes everyone feels at home. I removed one star from my review because the hotel allows guests to come to breakfast in their robe. It happened three mornings during our stay and it is not appropriate for a four star hotel.,
5,Anniversary to remember,Hotel Giraffe helped to make our 30th anniversary one to remember.  Arranged for a car/driver pick-up at the airport| facilitated our preferred room request| and we were greeted with a bottle of bubbly chilling in our room upon our arrival.  All special requests were cheerily fulfilled.  Evening wine and cheese served up by the lovely Gabriella is a nice way to finish your day and begin your evening activities.  Our room more than met our expectations| and the location of the hotel is convenient to two subway stops within a few blocks.,
4,Another comfortable stay!,I have stayed at the Hotel Giraffe many times and am never disappointed.  The rooms are clean and spacious| the beds comfortable| and the staff helpful and kind.  The lobby breakfast area is so cheerful -- I find myself sitting for hours with the paper!,
1,Exceeding our expectations,We visited as part of celebrating my 60th| and were greeted by a bottle in our room on arrival. Bed is very comfortable and king size. Quiet room no noise and given a 7th floor as requested to avoid street noise. We loved the complimentary cheese| nibbles and wine set out in the lounge area early evening. A delightful Gabrielle would come round topping up glasses! We also appreciated the complimentary fruit salad| cereal| etc and toasts at breakfast which led to a relaxing start for the day (most other hotels in NY| no included breakfasts were offered). Very helpful staff at reception who gave advice to ourselves as tourists in NY| also helped with transfer back to the airport. Will full recommend Giraffe in NY to any visitors.,
14,Excellent Hotel in New York City,The location of this hotel is perfect| just a little way out from the hustle and bustle of Times Square but is convenient to get around New York.  We have visited The Giraffe on several occasions and it never fails to delight us.  Comfy beds and pillows| lots of luxurious touches.  Beautiful breakfast and afternoon cheese and wine.  The staff are very friendly and helpful| nothing is too much trouble.  Love the friendly atmosphere of this boutique hotel.  Cannot fault in any way.,
1,Love the Hotel Giraffe!!!,I travel frequently to New York to see my children| and always stay at the Hotel Giraffe! Such a lovely hotel! Location is excellent on Park ave south steps away from beautiful Madison Square Park. Great restaurants around.The rooms are spacious| lovely and clean. Love my continental breakfast especially the excellent coffee and fresh fruit salad. Love the wine and cheese in the evening! Most importantly |the service is top notch| and the employees are so genuinely nice and helpful! Gabby is the best!,
3,Nice weekend in NYC at the Giraffe.,We have stayed in many different NYC hotels| but this is our first stop over at the Giraffe. It is a clean| efficient and well run facility in a good location. The staff are helpful with positive attitude. In particular Gabriella| who manages and serves the complimentary breakfasts and late afternoon wine and cheese in the lobby| is a gem. We will be back. ,
3,Perfect location and great service as always,We returned to Hotel Giraffe for our annual trip to New York City and were once again very pleased with our decision. Location is perfect and within walking distance to Central Park| Times Square| Grand Central Station| etc. We also walked to Hudson Yards and Highline (30 min).   We also return because of the attentive and professional service from Juan Carlos and Almira and all staff. Thank you for a delightful stay. We look forward to returning next year!,
1,Home again,This is my very favorite hotel.Always greeted warmly ! Best beds in the world! It’s a great location for all parts of NYC and many really wonderful restaurants nearby to chose from. The staff from top to bottom is terrific. I’m going back for a week in February and can’t wait!!!,
2,My favorite midtown oasis,This hotel has a very intimate vibe. The people at the desk are friendly and helpful and the morning breakfast is always lovely. The woman who helps to serve all the customers has the most gracious attitude and will always remember how you like your coffee or bagel. ,
2,A wonderful breath of fresh air,After staying at another hotel in Hell's Kitchen for the first half of the week| Hotel Giraffe was a welcome departure from the hustle and bustle of Times Square.   First of all| the location. There were several metro stations within 10 minutes' walking distance| with the 6 station conveniently one block north. The Empire State building's super close as well. The NOMAD neighborhood is incredibly relaxing| with the Madison Square Park (and original Shake Shack!) just a couple blocks away as well.  Second| the service. Service at Hotel Giraffe was exquisite. The staff are uncommonly polite and helpful. This is by far the nicest hotel I've ever stayed at in NYC| especially for the price. If the other Library hotels are like this| I think I've found a new chain to frequent.  Third|…,
1,Lynn's view,We had a great time at Hotel Giraffe. The service was gracious and attentive without being overbearing. Our room was a comfortable size (unlike some other hotel rooms we've stayed in NY) and we had a tiny terrace that looked out on Park Ave. The location was perfect for us.,
7,This is it!,This was the trip of a lifetime and staying here was simply amazing! The welcome and the rooms were everything we had hoped for (mind you| it a long flight). Loved the little step-out balcony and looking out onto the bustling city-life.,
1,Exceptional Service!,I cannot say enough about the exceptional accommodations and service at Hotel Giraffe. Everything from check in to check out was wonderful. The front desk staff is very friendly and helpful| the morning breakfast staff is wonderful and the young lady who takes care of the evening cocktail reception is fantastic!  This hotel has very comfortable beds| great pillows and immaculately clean rooms. It will be my “go to” hotel whenever I visit the city. ,
5,Love this hotel!,I have stayed here several times and think it is the best value for great customer service and accommodations that were clean| quiet and well appointed.  Our queen room had a sunny balcony with plants and a few chairs.  They have complementary wine & cheese before dinner and fresh fruit| yogurt| eggs| etc in the am.  overall great stay,
5,Fantastic hotel,My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for 5 nights. I cannot fault the hotel| or the service we received. Our room was lovely| roomy and extremely clean and comfortable. The attention to detail was impressive - we had been asked what sort of mattress topper and pillows we wanted and whether we wanted a coffee maker in our room. A full range of toiletries was available in the bathroom| and the housekeeping was of a very high standard. I had asked for a quiet room| and that is exactly what we got - we heard no noise at all from either inside or out. Breakfast each morning was delicious| and the drinks and snacks available in the lounge all day were very welcome. And happy hour was a delight| with drinks| cheese and biscuits and piano music while we relaxed in the…,
1,Always a great experience,I have the privilege of staying at the Giraffe a few times a year and it is never disappointing. I feel like family when i arrive and this extends to those on staff i have met before or am just engaging with for the first time.  Clean and comfortable meets professional and upscale!,
48,Great Hotel,Stayed at Hotel Giraffe for 7 nights| great location| very comfortable rooms and beds. Staff all helpful and friendly. Happy hours in lounge enjoyable and breakfast good|continental but option of hot at extra cost if req.Highly recommended.,
11,Always excellent!,We love staying here. Staff from the front door to the registration desk| to the breakfast and happy hour staff always remember us and welcome us back. Rooms are large for NYC standards and are very clean.,
10,Giraffe Hotel,Lovely boutique hotel| excellent service. In a quieter part of New York.  Can be busy at breakfast time with no tables available. It has a cool roof top bar. They have cheese and wine for a few hours every day but we didn't manage to attend as we were so busy enjoying the city!!!,
45,Four Days in Manhattan,Fabulous hotel with excellent attentive service. Highly recommend for business or family travel. Location is great. The hotel is very clean and could not hear street noise from the room. Staff was friendly and very attentive. ,
4,Great place to stay,First time staying at a the Griaffe. I thought it was lovely. Special touches of breakfast and wine time and fruit and cookies at all times. The staff was extra nice and welcoming | Rooms were very nice too. I highly recommend it and hope to stay there again.,
1,Loved our stay.,Love the Giraffe/Library Hotels.  Staff were very helpful and professional.  Amenities are much appreciated.  Great location. And THANK YOU for not charging the much loathed resort fee.  That guarantees we will return.  ,
15,Perfect location,Excellent location| nice area for bars and restaurants. Great hotel| very boutique but can do with a facelift. Our room had a very usd feel to it but the rest was good. Loved the breakfast bar and the wine and cheese n the afternoon.,
2,My go to hotel,Always clean| comfy and attentive. A great little place in NY where I love to stay!  Recommend to all my friends. Easy to get anywhere in NY and a bonus is it’s across from Upland which is an awesome place to eat or just sit at the bar!,
45,Hands down - Fantastic!!,We live locally and wanted someplace special for 50th birthday weekend. Looked at the Ritz| Four Seasons and other high end hotels. Normally| we’re fans of the Westin Times Square which has become way too overrated. So| so glad we came upon Hotel Giraffe! It was a fantastic experience| start to finish. Can’t say enough about it or recommend. The service is terrific| could not have been nicer| rooms are great and lovely low key location. Looking forward to return visits!,
212,Solid Hotel with good service but no way this is #1 in NYC,"This appears to be a recently renovated hotel with nice rooms.  We had a suite..not sure if all rooms have suites.  The rooms are small (the bed takes most of the room)| a small but functional bathroom (just one sink) and a small sitting room.  The TV is a 24"" in the bedroom which is quite small given current standards.  Bed was a little saggy but fine.  Street noise not too bad on the 26th Avenue side even on the 4th floor.   The lobby is very nice and airy. They have happy hour wine and an excellent cheese servings.   Service is probably the best part of the hotel.  This is a nice offering but those ranking this as the #1 hotel in NYC don't really have a clue to the truly luxurious hotel offerings in town.   This is not even close.  But it is a good business hotel especially…",
213,My new NYC go-to hotel,I cannot rave about this hotel enough!  I have had 2 stays here: first in February for a few nights to try it out| then we booked an 8 night stay for our son's wedding in July.  Since many of our friends and family wanted to stay in the same hotel I worked with Ray Shum for the best possible rates and pestered him with emails about various concerns. Ray was unfailingly helpful and pleasant.  We booked a King suite which was lovely and spacious and came in handy when the bride and groom needed a bed for one night and were able to use the pullout couch. The bed was comfortable| we had a coffee maker| an empty fridge for snacks etc| there was plenty of storage space| everything we needed really.  We loved the location| the friendly staff at the desk| the super doormen| the…,
1,Surprise Gem !,Hotel Giraffe was recommended by a friend...and I can honestly say it was not a first choice but| because our travels were during the opening days of the UN our usual choices were full our ridiculously expensive.So| we were thrilled to find rooms and at a good price...We were plesantly surprised by a lovely lovely and a room that was large and comfortable! The fact that there was a continenal breakfast until 10:30 and cheese and wine in the lobby in the late afternoon was an added bonus!We loved it and took advantage of it...the staff could not have been nicer. Absolutely lovely,
2,Great location| great service| great rooms,The location is great for seeing all of New York| but in a quieter section of Park Avenue near two MTA stops. Both the lobby and rooftop deck made for nice places to relax beyond the room. While not the big| expansive hotels you could stay out elsewhere it’s an outsized experience for its size. ,
129,Don’t know when I enjoyed a hotel stay more !,This| for us| is the perfect hotel. We switched here from Kimpton’s when their ownership changed and we felt the quality declined.  We always look for a hotel we can call (a temporary) home and the first thing we felt was how warm| welcoming and accommodating each and every member of their staff was towards us. Special thanks to Ray. The place is immaculate| rooms large and well configured. Great beds. We felt totally safe and secure. Complimentary breakfast and wine & snacks in the late afternoon. Valet parking worked very well. Wouldn’t think of staying anywhere else. ,
1,Excellant boutique hotel,We loved our time at Hotel Giraffe. It was beautifully appointed| the service was fantastic across the board and the hotel is perfectly located in Manhattan for easy access to anything in the city. The only downside is the construction next door and the concrete saw that went off at 3 AM. But that's New York| so we choose to stick in ear plugs and continuing enjoying this vibrant city. We give a very high mark to this property!,
1,Excellent room| service snacks|etc,One of the best hotels we ever stayed at. Breakfast| wine and cheese| rooms| beds| showers everything was outstanding. Good safe location. Nice restaurant right in the hotel. Not overpriced. Clean and small enough to be personable. ,
2,Mr Keith Leek,We Stayed on three seperate occasions on this trip going back and forth to other cities. Staff are always excellent but special mention to Jose on front entrance assisting with all sorts of everyday travelers queries and questions. Helped us out immensely. Another person who must be mentioned is Gabriela who ran the complimentary evening wine and cheese gathering. Excelled in making everyone feel comfortable and have a great time. insuring the best end to the day| someone who really loves her work. We have stayed here before and why we chose the hotel again with great rooms and excellent location. However needs a bit of an upgrade especially the bathroom that is a bit dated.,
2,Truly exceptional hotel experience in the perfect location,Our first stay at Hotel Giraffe was exceptional. My 17 yr old daughter and I stayed there this past weekend 9/20 - 9/23 for her birthday weekend. There were balloons and cupcakes waiting for her in the room as I'd requested| even though we checked in a bit early. Our room had a beautiful Juliet balcony and the maid was always had a sweet smile. The entire staff was always pleasant| great eye contact| and very patient - never seem to be in a rush or too busy to answer questions. I want to pay a special thanks to Jose who made sure our Uber driver got to us in spite of the UN traffic the morning we checked out. He was outside| actively tracking down the Uber driver to help him get to a safe place to pick us up for our trip to the airport.  The hotel room was large| well-appointed|…,
1,Wonderful stay in New York,The location is perfect to discover New York. Furthermore| the staff is very kind - feels like home! The wine and cheese at the evening is perfect after a long day in Manhatten| also the breakfast is more than enough for a perfect start of the day.,
3,A little gem at Park and 26th,I've stayed at the Hotel Giraffe numerous times and have always returned home thinking what a terrific hotel it is. The rooms are great| the service excellent | and the hotel staff genuinely nice and extremely helpful. ,
3,Worth every penny ...,We love this hotel. Staff is nice. Breakfast is delicious. And rooms are super comfy (and quiet| go figure!!). We always seem to arrive at 10 AM (by Amtrak) and they always graciously hold our bags until our room is ready| and insist we eat another breakfast in their lobby.  Love Love Love this place!,
2,Great Hotel,We recently had our first stay at the Giraffe Hotel. The room was spacious and lovely with a really good bathroom and all the expected amenities. All of the staff was friendly and very helpful. The hotel is conveniently located for walking with lots of great restaurants in the neighborhood and near subways. Delicious breakfast and snacks provided all day. We are planning our next visit. ,
117,Enjoyable stay in NYC,Just returned from a 4 night stay at the giraffe and was very impressed.  The rooms are a great size for NYC| plenty of room for your suitcases and shopping. Rooms were clean and bed was comfortable. Bottled water is also provided daily| which was great.   The staff at this hotel are superb. Everyone was so friendly throughout our stay and happy to help with any questions etc.  There’s lots of choice at breakfast| cereal| bagels| fruit| yogurt| pastries and tea/coffee. Also| from 5pm - 8pm| the hotel provides complimentary wine and cheese.   I would highly recommend the giraffe. Good rooms| great location and excellent customer service from all staff!,
369,Wonderful stay in a safe area,We got a classic king suite for a family of three. The third person sleeps on a good sofa bed in the living room. The disadvantage of the setup was that the living room becomes tight. Here's how I found the hotel: -  very good staff; atttentive and professional - well maintained and clean room - spacious toilet and bath - qualitative toiletries - nice view  of park avenue from the room - very near Madison Park and  many restaurants  within walking distance in the area - near the Flatiron building as well as clothes shops in 5th avenue - ample supply of water and coffee in the room - deluxe continental breakfast of good quality although missing out on warm food; the only warm food was boiled eggs - refreshments in the lobby were good treats| especially the wine and cheese in the…,
3,A Truely Great Experience,It was our 2nd time at the Giraffe Hotel and it was amazing.  The staff treat you like family and the low key| subtle approach to everything allows you to feel so relaxed.  From the lovely breakfasts in the morning to the gorgeous wine and cheese early evenings its 5 star all the way. The location also is so good to get around New York with great access to subways.,
75,Fab,"We stayed here for five nights over New Year and the whole experience was wonderful. The hotel is spotlessly clean| rooms are large(ish) for New York. Breakfast selection is good and best of all the evening wine and cheese get together is included. We had previously stayed at the sister hotel ""Casablanca"" on Times Square but their prices around New Year were crazy| the Giraffe represented a fabulous alternative on Park Avenue| how gauche is that! Lots of bars and restaurants close by and a subway station a couple of blocks away. ",
1,Wonderful stay| as always,We love this hotel.  This was our third stay.  It's very quiet| clean| friendly| modern and nice but not pretentious.  This hotel has my favorite pillows too - fluffy and soft.  The location is great.  I was especially excited to see that Sarabeth's delivers to the hotel for a nominal fee!  We'll definitely come back.,
3,NYC Gem!,This hotel has been one of the greatest finds! Stumbled upon it when looking for a place to stay in NYC several years ago when their sister hotel| Casablanca| showed up on a list of top places to stay. Casablanca was full the weekend I needed and we ended up staying here. Ever since that trip we stay at Hotel Giraffe every time we come to NYC. The rooms are beautiful. The beds are comfortable. We love the turn down service. My favorite continental breakfast (but that could just be the New York bagels). The staff is incredibly helpful and pleasant. Hotel Giraffe is my all time favorite hotel anywhere.,
4,Fantastic hotel !! Great welcoming staff !!,We stayed for 6 nights  Great location- close to many landmarks  Clean and neat place ! Excellent polite and courteous staff Gabriel in the wine and cheese evening service is an absolute star !! Would definitely recommend this hotel,
1,Great boutique hotel,A great small hotel in a wonderful neighborhood centrally located in New York City. Breakfast and afternoon wine & cheese were complementary. Room was excellent - good size| clean and well-apointed. We will certainly be back. ,
834,Has become our go to favourite ,A great place to stay. Come as a guest leave as family. Repeat visits are a pleasure. Morning breakfast is always a good good. Chairs are a bit low for the tables! Newspapers are there and a smiling service staff. Evening wine and cheese welcome after a hectic NY day. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Lighting could be better and bathrooms are a bit dated! A good choice for a stay.,
16,All About Their Guests!,Had a fabulous stay at this hotel in Aug 2019! Upon arrival we were welcomed by such a warming team who greeted us with a smiley friendly face! Just what you want after a 7hr flight & 1.5 hr taxi queue/journey. The team answered all our questions & took our bags up to the room. We stayed in a suite with balcony & wow the room was large with plenty of storage & queen sized bed| just perfect I’ve never slept so well!!    Breakfast was lovely & served by friendly staff who seemed to enjoy their job! In an evening we would escape the madness & relax in the lobby with complimentary wine| cheeses & a soft drink for the little one! Perfect place to stay! Could not fault what so ever!   Thank you Hotel Giraffe for making our trip so memorable!,
26,City Bliss,I travel to NYC frequently and this is by far my favorite hotel. The staff is warm and helpful. The room as impeccably clean. The items I preordered from room service were delivered and displayed upon our arrival. Th complimentary snacks and waters were always available. The room was quiet and bed was comfortable.  This is my new favorite!,
4,Good| better| best! ,Looking for hotel in NYC for one trip April and one in May| it was important for us to have a spacious| calm family room| balcony (which is very rare to find) and breakfast. This hotel met all the criteria and is very well and centrally located. The first good impression made the receptionists| who were very polite| friendly and helpful| then the room which was even better than on the pictures of the website. In the afternoons after eventful and tiring days| we could enjoy apéro with great and relaxing live piano music and a tasty buffet| the evenings we could spend on the beautiful terrace on the top floor. A really splendid and cute hotel| highly recommended.   The very best hotel to make the most out of your trip to NYC!   Thank you very much Hotel Giraffe by Library Hotel…,
2,Excellent stay in NYC,Great room| service| cheese&wine aperò| breakfast. Well serviced by public transport with easy access to the main locations. Not to miss when you want to visit New York City. Easy access to WiFi| clean room.,
4,Fantastic hotel and great service,Hi there  We had a fantastic stay in this hotel. Great location| fantastic service and great reception each evening made this a very nice hotel for a family stay.  We had an issue one day which meant we were going to miss a tour and incur a penalty charge which the staff resolved for us which saved us a lot of money and hassle.  Big thanks to Asim (hotel manager)| and another chap on reception (sorry didn’t catch his name) for helping us while we had an issue to resolve and also Gabrielle for amazing service at breakfast and the evening receptions.  Thanks again - we will definitely stay here again on the next stay we have in NYC  Morris family ,
1,Excellent Hotel| Location and staff,I have just returned from 8 days in NY staying at the Hotel Giraffe with 7 friends. From the moment we started booking we were greeted with friendly and helpful responses from Ray Schumm. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted and nothing was too much. The location is excellent| the rooms are very comfortable and are a great size ( I was sharing and it was more than big enough for 2 people with lots of luggage!) Gabriela who served breakfast and then wine and cheese in the evenings was an absolute delight. We absolutely loved out stay and it certainly contributed to how much we enjoyed our holiday. We will be back!,
3,Great girls weekend!,Spent the weekend celebrating my mom’s birthday. Staff was amazing and made everything special. Sparkling wine| chocolates| and a birthday card. Great room. Wine & cheese and breakfast exceeded our expectations. Would absolutely stay here again. ,
2,Best boutique hotel in NYC,This was out 2nd trip to Hotel Giraffe and we were not disappointed! Always a delight!!!!  Maybe the nicest thing is Gabriela in the evenings during wine and cheese! Or Manny is always willing to take care of anything at the front desk.  All staff is fantastic and make you feel at home!,
19,Home from home,This was our third stay at Hotel Giraffe and the experience was great - as always. Staff is always friendly and helpful| the rooms spacious and very clean and the whole atmosphere is calm and friendly. Thanks to the staff (especially Gabriela!) for making our stay unforgettable!,
31,Wonderful Hotel and great location,We stayed at 4 Library Collection hotels and the Giraffe was our favourite. The staff were extremely professional and friendly. The room was fantasic| the breakfast and evening wine reception top notch and the location was perfect. Close to public transport and walking distance to Broadway| 5th Avenue| Madison Square Park| Fashion district| etc. We like smaller boutique hotels and this did not dissapoint. Highly recommend the Library Collection (except Casablanca was not the best..... see my review of that one).,
2,Great Birthday Stay!,We stay at the Hotel Giraffe a few times each year| when we visit from NJ.   Always exception service and staff.  Amazing location in the Flatiron District.  Walking distance to great restaurants and the park.  Perfect central location to get anywhere in the city.   Had another great experience here.  We will definitely be back again very soon.  Thank You!!  ,
12,Midtown Favorite,This is my third stay at The Giraffe. We had a one bedroom suite which was just enough space for my husband and I and our son. I like this hotel. You get a good Americano in the morning along with a fresh continental breakfast. Spend the day sightseeing| shopping and lunching and arrive back at the hotel for a wine hour with fantastic snacks. With this added value this makes staying here worthwhile. Special cudos to Gabriella who can look after every single person in the lobby on her own with a genuine smile on her face. All of the staff was really friendly and helpful.,
554,Great Weekend Getaway ...,"Came to the city for the weekend and to see a show and was initially going to stay in Midtown| but this place came up on trip advisor was excellent reviews at a similar price and we decided to give it a try. It's out of the hustle and bustle of Times Square| but frankly| that's a huge plus. This place has customer service down to a science -- always accommodating| helpful with recommendations and reservations| cheerful| and all the things I can only wish other hotels would think about doing for their guests. The wine and cheese reception is an excellent touch and the rooms are comfy and good sized for a New York place to stay. Outside noise is reasonably well insulated although you do hear the ""noise of the city"" throughout the night. Lots of places to each nearby from pubs to…",
11,Lovely hotel!,Everything about Hotel Giraffe was wonderful!  The rooms are really clean| comfortable and cozy. The breakfast in the lobby and coffee all day is a great part of the charm. The evening wine and cheese is spectacular!  I will definitely be back soon!!,
3,Great boutique hotel,I love the personal touches| after a long day getting a cup of tea in the lobby to take up to the room. Quiet| good beds| great counter space in the bathrooms. Staff makes me feel like it’s my home away from home.,
2,The only place to stay in NYC!!,The rooms are spacious as are the bathrooms.   The employees are extremely helpful and friendly.  They offer a complimentary breakfast.   We really appreciated and enjoyed the complimentary wine and cheese reception every evening.  ,
24,Wonderful hotel,Wonderful hotel.   Small bedrooms| but great public spaces.  Top floor terrace for after dinner cocktail very nice.  Breakfast on ground floor wonderful.  Staff very helpful.  I will be back often to this hotel.,
1,Excellent  hotel,"Thank you to Jason| Nick and especially Gabrielle for looking after us in Hotel Giraffe during our recent 10 day stay in NYC. This hotel is small and friendly| with a great staff| fantastic breakfast included| an unending supply of beverages and cakes/pastries/fruit available throughout the day and wine/cheese available every afternoon all included as part of your hotel charge. We had a classic double room on the first floor for two adults and two very grown up ""children"" and we had plenty of space. It's in a great location and we would have no qualms about returning to this hotel the next time we visit NY. Many thanks to all for making our stay so pleasant.",
1,Amazingly Accommodating!!,Just fantastic across the board! The location| amenities| service| etc. It’s very difficult to find a hotel in this area with a balcony. The GM is great| the valet/doorman was wonderful| the front desk staff pleasant and informative| the servers accommodating| even the housekeeping and maintenance staff were delightful! I’m in the service industry and highly recommend Hotel Giraffe! ,
749,Outstanding customer service ,I stayed at this hotel while in NYC for business. It is a quieter and more low-key area of the city (near Gramercy Park) that I had not stayed in before. It is between the East Village and Midtown.  The front desk people were very welcoming. The room was slightly larger than standard in New York. The bed was comfortable and they offered bathrobes and complimentary water. The room also had a lovely little balcony and automated blackout shades.  They also had a free wine happy hour with a live pianist| and snacks from 5-8pm at night. Additionally| they provide a free continental breakfast.  Overall| they were lovely and accommodating. It was a nice| quiet hotel away from the hustle and bustle of other parts of the city.  *The only thing I would recommend to them is to invest in…,
4,Hotel Giraffe is better than ever,Just returned from our 4th trip to NYC and 4th time staying at the Giraffe. Once again| the Giraffe never fails to impress. From the initial booking via Ray - who gave us a great rate as returning guests and arranged a car to pick us up from the airport - the service was fantastic.   When we arrived| we were greeted with chocolates in the room and a personalised note welcoming us back. The hotel is immaculate and the staff impeccably friendly and welcoming| It was especially nice to catch up with Gabriella who runs the evening wine and cheese as we have come to know her over the years.    We especially appreciated the touches that make Giraffe special| like the complementary continental breakfast| wifi| bottles of water replenished in the room every day - even an umbrella in…,
47,I’m a little confused...,..as to how this is the #1 hotel in New York City. I can only put it down to perhaps the price point and location. The staff are perfectly nice and the location is great but the hotel overall is very much ‘average’. The room was big & clean but very much basic & a little date and the breakfast - no hot food| cereal came in boxes and the coffee wasn’t great. Maybe I’m spoiled by living in Asia but at the end of our stay| we just couldn’t understand how this hotel has so many raving reviews and its ranking. Maybe this is all relative to what’s available in New York City - that is a depressing thought though...  Just not the experience we were expecting and one of those rare occasions where I’ve been disappointed / surprised by a TripAdvisor recommendation.,
3,Weekend in NYC,This was our second time staying at the Giraffe Hotel and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The service is impeccable| the room was beautiful| clean| and quiet and we've loved the breakfast and the cocktail time after a day of sightseeing!,
9,Best hotel in NYC,Great stay at the Hotel Giraffe the entire staff was fantastic from the moment we walked in the door. The Giraffe is a smaller hotel for NYC maybe 6-8 rooms each floor and the hotel only 12 floors with a very private bar on the roof for cocktails before you head out into the city. Great stay we’ll definitely be back.,
15,Close to everything and great value.,Great hotel if you love walking. We were able to make it to all the sites we wanted to without using any transportation. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Wine and cheese bar every night was a delight and the free breakfast was great. The room was clean and offered nice natural light. We would stay here again.,
9,Wonderful stay at The Hotel Giraffe,I returned to The Hotel Giraffe after a few years away| and I have to say it was still FABULOUS. The staff is so kind and accommodating. The unique lobby of this hotel provides a continental breakfast| fresh water| and cookies all day| along with wine| cheese| crackers| veggies and beautiful live piano playing for happy hour. One of the best features is the location. Right on Park Ave and surrounded by FABULOUS restaurants. I highly recommend this fabulous hotel!!  ,
7,Average,"The hotel was ok| the rooms were clean and comfortable enough. My biggest issue was the ""resort"" fee (a fishy way of charging extra for the room while paying less taxes to the city) Besides that| breakfast was regular at best| no hot items| like sausage| bacon or eggs (besides hard boiled)  Would not come back ",
2,"Giraffe isjust ""OK""","Stayed for one night at the hotel and it's just ""oK"".  Staff was friendlier at the Hotel Elysee.  Much nicer properties include the Michaelangelo and the Refinery Hotel at this price point|  My family will not be staying here again.  So I'd say the hotel was overhyped compared to the reality of staying at this property.  However| the location is good and the hotel was clean|  ",
5,Best little secret stay in center of the action in NYC. location,Always warm and welcoming each return visit to my NYC home away from home.  Breakfast and Happy hour with Gabriella’s bubbly personality makes the Giraffe my first choice hotel. I recommended this gem to my friends who are now applauding their stays at the Giraffe also. ,
55,Elegant and stylish hotel,Hotel Giraffe never disappoints. Lovely| well appointed rooms| generously proportioned for New York. Staff could not be more friendly| discreet and helpful. Many I recognised from my previous visit two years ago| which was unexpected. Great complimentary inclusions| including breakfast| all day and night tea| coffee| cookies| fresh fruit and pastries| and a daily three hour happy hour| with a range of snacks available| and some very good quality wines.  Nothing is too much trouble at Hotel Giraffe. ,
55,Hotel Giraffe,Had a very nice stay. Good location for walking in New York. Liked the breakfast and Happy Hour with piano music. Room was nice with small balcony. Nice to be able to open the doors/windows. Italian onsite restaurant was excellent.,
1,What a great hotel!,My family and I stayed for 3 nights in July and we were thoroughly impressed. Hotel Giraffe has the friendliest| kindest staff and such nice amenities. We especially enjoyed listening to their pianist over a nice glass of wine. Can’t wait to go back!,
772,Just Missed a Fifth Star,A two night stay in late July at Hotel Giraffe was mostly excellent.  The location at 26th and Park Avenue is convenient (subway entrance in the NY Life bldg across the street during peak hours| and two blocks north all day)| even if the neighborhood| particularly on Lexington Ave.| has a bit of urban grit.  The lobby and rooms are very nice and well kept.  Morning breakfast and evening wine and apps are included| which is a nice benefit in NY| where even a simple breakfast can require a bank loan.  Room was spacious by NY standards| modern and well maintained.  My only issue was that sleep quality was a bit off.  For starters| I prefer a room to be three things - cold| dark and quiet.  Giraffe hit the cold part nicely| and the HVAC was probably the quietest I have found in a…,
1,Wish we could have stayed longer!,Loved everything about the place.  The room was beautiful and spacious| the staff was friendly and professional and the extras made the stay even more enjoyable.  We even received a birthday surprise in the room!  Very| very pleased.,
245,Perfect blend of charm and efficiency,Giraffe is not the most impressive hotel I've stayed at (Quadrifolio in Cartagena) and it's far from the most affordable. However| there's a reason it's currently ranked at the top of NYC hotels| and here's why:  * Comfort. How many times have I paid a fortune only to be given a room with lumpy| tired| or hard beds? (Why do hotels so often get this wrong?) The water in the bathroom is hot| and you can shower without flooding the floor. The temperature control is easy to use and the windows open for fresh air.   * Service. The staff is like the best kind of family| helpful without being intrusive.   * Location. We walked everywhere in NYC from this hotel. The subway is just a few hundred feet away too. And a lot of good restaurants.   * Extras. An extended happy hour that…,
23,Summer in the city,We recently stayed at the Hotel Giraffe.  Great location.  Only 20 minutes walk to the theater district.  I can't say enough about this hotel.  One of the cleanest hotels i have even stayed in.  Everything is immaculate.  Staff were very helpful and extremely pleasant.  One can only believe that this is a great hotel to work at.  We had king rooms with a balcony.  Very comfortable bedding. The continental breakfast as well as the wine and cheese in the evening were nice added touches.  If you find yourself in the NoMad district| you should definately stay here. Late check out is nice too!,
31,Lovely| quiet hotel,The Hotel Giraffe is quickly becoming our go-to for short trips into Manhattan. Rooms are extremely clean| quiet (and having lived in Manhattan for almost a decade| I can tell you many areas are NOT quiet)| staff are incredibly friendly and who doesn’t love a free wine and cheese happy hour?? We’ve twice been placed in a room on the 12th floor| and I’d even say it’s a large room by city standards. We’ll continue to call the Hotel Giraffe home for short trips from the suburbs.,
20,Great hotel with suites for families!,I scoured the web looking for affordable suites for families in New York City and I’m glad I chose Hotel Giraffe. Their 2-room suites have a king bed in the master and a pull-out double in the family room. Be sure to ask for a room with a view because the suite where my daughter and I stayed for three nights was much larger than the one my husband and son stayed in for one night when they met us in NYC.  Rooms are decorated elegantly in rich reds and creams. We were on the third floor but were not disturbed by traffic noise outside.   A continental breakfast buffet is provided to guests in the morning. Unfortunately for me as a gluten-free eater| this meant mostly pastries and bread products. There were also hard-boiled eggs| yogurts and fruit| though.  The afternoon…,
33,Perfect Stay,My family were in NYC for a wedding and we couldn’t have been more pleased with our experience at the Hotel Giraffe!  The moment we stepped in through their doors we felt welcome and were greeted by a friendly| efficient front desk staff.  We booked a king suite and queen room to accommodate our family of 5| which were spacious and comfortable.  Definitely great value for the money| especially as it included a daily continental breakfast with fruit| assortment of breads and hard boiled eggs| as well as a complimentary happy hour wine and cheese.  A special thank you to Gabriela who is a wonderful asset to the hotel - her energy and lovely smile during breakfast and happy hour made our stay all the more memorable and pleasant.  Highly recommend this hotel!,
2,First Time,The hotel and room was clean and comfortable. The staff was pleasant and accommodating. The hotel ia around great shopping and restaurants and transit stations. Although Tulip and Bread is not affiliated with the hotel| it was a pleasant surprise and its staff was also nice and friendly.,
1,Almost perfect,"The room was great! Service was excellent. Our only issues were the $21 per day ""resort fee"" when there was no pool and the rooftop was unavailable to hotel guests one night because of a private function.",
3,6 days in nyc,From the welcoming feeling as you came in to the hotel to the helpful concierge as we left| the whole stay was excellent.  Bed was great. Amenities very good.  The coffee all day and wine and snacks at night was a winner for us ,
1,Highly recommend!,Great hotel - staff is friendly| rooms are great (cleaned each day| plenty of towels| balcony rooms have great views| etc.) and the breakfast and happy hours are a really nice touch. We came for our wedding and it was well worth it. ,
14,Fantastic| relaxing family stay,We stayed at Hotel Giraffe for 4 nights.  From beginning to end| our stay was fantastic.    This is one of the most relaxing hotels I have stayed at.  The rooms and all the communal areas are superbly clean and in great condition.  Our room was large for NYC and was a great size for the four of us (our children are 11 and 8).  The staff were consistently helpful and friendly without being overbearing - they flexed their style depending on the guests with plenty of time for those that wanted to chat or a more relaxed style for other.  They were great with the children and again made them feel really welcome.  The breakfast and drinks / snacks all day were both great and made our stay really easy.  We were up very early after arriving from the UK and being able to get fresh…,
2,Fantastic!!!!,Clean rooms| EXTREMELY nice staff. I’ve stayed here many times over the last 7 yrs| not once have I been disappointed. From the light breakfast to the happy hour| to the turndown service in the evening - just the best| my preferred hotel in NYC. Highly recommend.,
48,Lovely stay,I have just stayed 10 days at this hotel as part of a wedding group.  I commend the staff.  They were so helpful and courteous.  Nothing was a problem.  My room was comfortable and well maintained on the 8th floor.  The breakfast was delicious and a great selection.  The staff serving were fabulous| never flustered.  The wine and cheese in the evening is brilliant.  Location is good| easy walks to landmarks.  I will definitely stay there again.  Special mention to Gabrielle!  A true gem!,
22,Great location| wine and cheese is fun... but not the best hotel in NYC,A nice| boutique hotel. It is well located with a lively park and the Flatiron building nearby. Wine and cheese is fun and seems to have captivated the guests. We met someone who was on his eighth stay! Is this the best hotel in NYC? Well| no| but it's fun and it shows how doing something can help you stand out from the crowd.,
9,50th Birthday Trip,Just returned from a 5 night visit at Hotel Giraffe. All staff were very professional| helpful and so very nice. Booking in was of no hassle. Room on 6th floor with balcony( if you dare to go out and have a look). Room was a good size with everything you could ask for|even extras on a list. The air conditioning definitely required during our visit was great.  The breakfast was continental of a high standard with the lovely ladies toasting your bagels and making your hot drinks.  Hot drinks and beverages available all day with the exceptionally good cheese and wine evenings hosted by the lovely Gabrielle.  The roof was a little sanctuary in the evenings.  The hotel was within a 30 minute walk to Times Square safe area. The subway was just 2 streets up from the hotel. We walked…,
1,A delightful stay in the Hotel Giraffe,I needed to stay in NYC for 3 weeks while I underwent surgery and until I was cleared to go home.  My wife| who needs care| stayed with me and we also had a home-care assistant as well.  We stayed in the room dedicated to handicapped persons on the second floor.  The room was well-equipped| clean and comfortable.  There were a couple of things that need improvement.  First| the small refrigerator is inside a wooden cabinet and| as a result| it struggled to keep drinks below room temperature.  Housekeeping brought us a stand-alone refrigerator that took care of that problem.  The sink features two taps for the water| which made it extremely difficult to draw water at a comfortable temperature.  It needs a single-handle faucet.  The other thing about the bathroom setup - and…,
3,Always wonderful,Always wonderful! Great location| warm and attentive staff| nice  breakfast| perfect happy hour with cheeses| wines ...and a piano at the back  we really feel at home ! Rooms are clean and bed linen of fine quality.  ,
21,Love the giraffe,This was a return visit with my family. Great staff| great location| great room quality| love the free cheese n wine every day. Staff are very genuine and friendly. Lovely Italian restaurant associated with hotel with 20% off for guests.,
101,happy return customer,love coming to the Hotel Giraffe for our annual NYC weekend| loved the great corner room and comfy bed| complimentary wine and cheese from 5 to 8 and the excellent breakfast in the morning each in the lobby; easy parking on adjacent streets| friendly and helpful hotel personnel| we look forward to coming back.,
2,First trip to New York,The Giraffe Hotel was truly amazing. They went above and beyond for my family. The staff treated us and my child like part of their family. Their location and attentive staff was worth every dollar spent!!!,
1,Wonderful hotel,We needed a room for 2 adults plus our 18 year old daughter. We stayed in a balcony king suite which was ideal. The service here is second to none| the wine and cheese reception a very welcome addition and the complimentary breakfast just right for us and more can be ordered in if required. Our balcony looked out of the front of the hotel from the 10th floor and gave us a great view and feel of New York.  All the staff were very friendly and extremely helpful with anything we needed including a car service and extras for the room.  Looking at other hotels in New York we certainly made the right choice. I would stay here again and recommend to friends and family without hesitation.,
7,Deserves rating,7 night stay in July.  Quite| clean| boutique hotel in great location. Green line at 23rd or 28th. Plenty of bars and restaurants and attractions nearby.   We stayed on the 26th street side of the building. 9th floor. Fantastic. Little bit of street noise but that’s to be expected. Heard nothing inside the hotel. Slept like a log. Rooms not overly big but still pretty reasonable for NYC. Clean and functional. Everything you need.   Staff very courteous and efficient. Breakfast and wine and cheese offerings were great. Newspapers etc.   Hotel has a nice personal| quiet vibe about it which is rare in NYC.   A few of the veneers around the hotel are getting a bit worn| but otherwise that’s the only negative I could think of.   Otherwise this is our new favourite hotel in NYC. Great…,
1,Great stay at Hotel Giraffe,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel Giraffe.  Every staff member we encountered was cordial| smiling| eager to help.  The desk staff was very knowledgeable and was able to help us with directions| best way to get to our destination| etc.  The morning breakfast and evening wine and cheese were very nice.  Again| wonderful service!  The fruit| coffee & tea| ice water| cookies & pastries available 24hrs made it so comfortable no matter what our schedule was. Turndown service with chocolates also very nice.  All the little extras made us feel special.  Perfect for celebrating a milestone birthday!  I mentioned my husband's birthday when I made the reservation.  When we arrived my husband was greeted with ""Happy Birthday"" and when we got to our room there was a bottle of wine|…",
3,THE Place to Stay,For my money| The Giraffe is the best place to stay in NYC.  Great service| wonderful staff| and large comfortable rooms.  And the lovely Gabriella treats everyone like she’s entertaining in her own home.  Love it!!,
114,Another great return visit,3rd stay at the Giraffe.  It's great when the staff at the front desk (JR) and at the breakfast/wine-cheese (Gabriella) remember you from previous visits even if the last one was 18-months ago.  Wonderful service| large comfortable rooms (I know| how rare is that in NYC?!)| superb amenities (24-hour access to espresso machine| fresh fruit and snacks very much appreciated)| 2-block walk to 2 different subway stops| easy walking distance to many sights - great to be in a boutique hotel instead of an impersonal chain.  We will absolutely return!,
9,Wonderful boutique hotel,After spending many hours searching online for the perfect hotel we decided  on this hotel. We booked direct with the hotel which was a little scary as we are in the UK. I emailed the hotel to check they had received our payment and booking and they replied very quickly. They also arranged a private car hire pick up for when we arrived in New York.  Everything from as soon as we arrived to the moment we left was superb. Lovely staff| lovely location ( 2 blocks from the subway)| great hotel overall. Nice breakfast in the morning| lovely cheese and wine reception. The server Gabrielle was amazing and is a real gem and credit to the hotel. Every evening when we sat down for wine Gabrielle would be over with our wine and kept us topped up all evening. It was so relaxing and lovely…,
6,Excellent,Every thing was the best in this beautiful boutique hotel. We enjoyed  very much our stay of 7 nights there. The room is nice  and clean and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The location is very good and we loved the design of the hotel. Breakfast is good and in the evening wine and cheese. coffee and cookies free during all the time.,
1,Great hotel.,Stayed here a few times. Lovely staff| lovely location| great hotel overall. Nice breakfast in the morning| nice evening Prosecco and cheese reception 😊   Room was cool| overlooking Park Avenue but not really so noisy as to be a problem. ,
44,Two Years On: Still a Star,"After Marriott gutted and ruined the Algonquin| our tried and true hotel since we left NYC many years ago| we tried Hotel Giraffe in 2017 on a visit back home for our 20th Anniversary.  Two years on it is still one of the best hotels we've experienced in the US or Europe. The staff is still extraordinarily friendly and helpful| starting with a late check-in after a late flight in from the West Coast and ending with an on-time car service to get to the airport 6 days later. The suites are still beautifully furnished| well appointed and impeccably maintained. And the breakfast is| for ""continental""| still wonderful and surprisingly diverse with a variety of choices - the best part being Gabriela| the lead staff person at breakfast (and also the evening wine and cheese reception…",
26,Lovely small hotel,The Hotel Giraffe is centrally located in a less touristy area of the city. The hotel itself is well maintained and the staff is professional and helpful. The rooms are very large and clean. Beds are comfortable and amenities modern. If you would like a quiet room I would suggest asking for one on the street side (not Park Avenue). Breakfast was continental ... nothing special but fine. The all day coffee service and afternoon refreshments were a nice touch after a day of walking. The service during the afternoon refreshments was mixed: One day| the server was SO helpful and kind| the next day| a different server was a little aloof and not very helpful.  I would definitely stay here again. ,
13,Love love love this place,We stay at the Giraffe whenever we can.  The accommodations are always wonderful.  The staff is polite and welcoming.  Breakfast in the morning with a wide array of choices.  Wine and cheese at night.  A perfect getaway.   The location is two blocks from the subway which made it very close to all.   Love coming here.,
9,Enjoyable July 4th Weekend,Really great experience in NYC. Hotel and room exceeded expectations and were even better than the photo’s.   The included breakfast was plentiful and the staff was very gracious. Would definitely stay here again on our next trip. ,
6,Always amazing!,It's been six years in a row and we always enjoy our stay (family of three) at Hotel Giraffe. From the front desk staff| to the doorman| to the server at breakfast and during the piano bar for the complimentary wine and cheese --- it's always a wonderful stay!,
2,Perfect,The room was clean and suited our purposes perfectly. My only criticism is that the bathroom door does not provide the privacy I prefer since the glasses is see-thru| but other than that I found the accommodations| service| lobby| etc. to be perfect. ,
5,Excellent As Usual,We have stayed at the Giraffe multiple times and it has always been a wonderful experience. All of the staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  We have stayed in many hotels in NYC and this is by far our favorite. ,
1,Great value,Excellent hotel. Great service and amazing value for the money. I was traveling with the family and the rooms with two beds were large and accommodating. They have breakfast every morning and an evening happy hour with wine and cheeses. Highly recommended. ,
224,Amazing,Stayed here for a week and absolutely loved it! Can see why it’s ranked #1 of hotels in NYC on Trip Advisor. All the staff are so friendly and helpful. The room itself was nice and spacious. Loved the rooftop garden| you can go up there just to sit and some days from 5-10pm they have drinks (have to pay as I think it’s linked to the restaurant downstairs/next door?). The complimentary breakfast is from 7-1030 on weekdays and til 11 on the weekend and is a lovely continental breakfast including cereals| fruit| pastries| bagels| toast| boiled eggs and tea/coffee. At other times throughout the day there are biscuits and pastries and tea/coffee out which was lovely to come back to for afternoon tea. Then from 5-8pm there is complimentary wine and cheese| really yum Brie and blue…,
166,Brilliant stay,A smart classy hotel that’ll make you feel very comfortable. Amazing rooms| excellent staff and lots of different foods offered. Right in the centre of New York| definitely worth staying in for somewhere rememberable.,
166,Good hotel,Nice touches from the wine and cheese| staff friendly and helpful| continental breakfast and refreshments all day  The room and bed very comfortable| would definitely recommend and stay again  Great location |  ,
21,If only more hotels were like a Giraffe....,Well I'd read about the Hotel Giraffe for many months and friends had recommended it to us so took the plunge and decided to stay further down mid town. Check in was excellent| guy was informative we had a room on the 8th floor on 26th Street with a separate lounge with a sofa bed for my daughter. Gabriela what can I say......she's pleasant| funny| jokingly stirred me which was great fun| she remembers people's drinks and food orders - on Monday we felt a bit disappointed as she wasn't in the lobby area to greet us for breakfast. She looked after my brothers with drinks if I was delayed getting to the drinks at night. All staff were brilliant: they found and made dinner bookings for us as it was pride march weekend so NYC was heaving with people. Beds and pillows etc are…,
8,Excellent location for touring the 212,Had an enjoyable stay @thegiraffe while we were touring the nyc. Especially enjoyed the happy hour wine & cheese with great service from all the staff| very welcoming. Would definitely recommend and stay again. Close to everything & the subway.  ,
24,Fun stay in NoMad,My family and I just finished a 3-day getaway to NYC. We stayed in NoMad and enjoyed Hotel Giraffe: very comfortable| clean and beautifully appointed rooms| well-located in walking distance of neighborhoods such as the Flatiron District| Chelsea| Hudson Yards| Greenwich Village and So-Ho. Very pleasant and helpful staff. Nice continental breakfast and great wine and cheese included. Minor negatives: 1) window in the bathroom door: despite textured glass| you can definitely make out if someone is dressed or not. Although not an issue if alone or a couple| not ideal if sharing your room with your teenage son... 2) shower curtain for bath/shower combo: for this category (and price) of hotel| a glass enclosure would have been expected. Overall| a wonderful stay. We would definitely…,
1,Just cool!,Really nice hotel| wonderfully helpful and pleasant staff! If you are happy with a light (not cooked) breakfast then this hotel is perfect. Included wine and cheese in early evening creates a really nice atmosphere.,
903,Returned to wonderful Hotel Giraffe after 12 years,We returned to the Giraffe after 12 years and still found it the excellent| warm and wonderful place to be as it was that time ago. We often thought back to the hotel in the last years| and were thrilled to be able to return. And we were happy to find this place still as good and perfect as it was and as we remembered it to be.  We stayed on a room on the 9th floor with the balcony to 26th street. Although being in NY| we could sleep with open balcony door. Room was absolutely clean| spacious and comfortable| and the housekeeping was extraordinary good –perfect in timing and thinking of everything.  Breakfast from 7 to 10:30 am (until 11am on Saturday and Sunday) serves bagels| pastry| cream cheese| butter| eggs| fresh fruit| juice| jam. Pastry| cookies| tea| coffee is provided…,
51,Overall nice but not special,After 6 months of planning a very special family trip to NY to see Hamilton| we chose this hotel instead of our usual “go to” venues based on the TA reviews. It must have been an off weekend. The hotel is lovely| the doormen are awesome| and the amenities very nice. We were able to use one of our rooms early| which was great as we had a packed schedule. We returned at 12 am and that’s when the issues started. The bathtub had a small chip and faint staining| unpleasant although clean. The bedside light switch was loose and a tiny spark flew out. The remote did not work. So tired by then| but a very nice man did respond immediately| fixed the remote and apologized for the light stating he would report it. I’m a nurse| I do hope it was fixed. Breakfast was so awkward| one of the…,
1,Family Vacation,Hotel Giraffe was a wonderful experience. Everyone from the front desk to the cleaning staff was extremely friendly| helpful and accommodating. The location was excellent in NYC| making most experiences walkable for our family. The staff there was always willing to help and go out of their way to make our stay wonderful. Extremely clean room| we even saw the staff cleaning the outside of the room doors and inside the elevator!!,
54,nice boutique hotel great location,nice modern rooms. very clean attentive and professional staff. in walking distance of many sights. hotel offers a breakfast that is included in room rate. sad to say that breakfast is supposed to be available starting at 7 am every day it was not fully stocked till 7:30. why offer it if items are not available??second there is a wine cocktail and cheese hour daily at 5 pm| the red wine is horrible| neither my wife or I could consume it . very bitter aftertaste. so again why offer it if the wine is so bad? the hotel manager should try some| just a suggestion. very nice on property restaurant called Bread and Tulips| we suggest you try .also room attendant was putting queen sheets on a king bed.. was not comfortable.,
201,A recent a vacation stay - outstanding,The Giraffe is a gem of a hotel. I would define it as a boutique hotel in an outstanding location. If you are looking for a location that is not full of tourist| this is the place to stay. The staff is outstanding| the room very clean and breakfast in the morning is perfect to get you started for the day. I highly recommend.,
1,NY Trip,Stayed here 4 nights with my daughter’s 21 birthday. The staff are this hotel’s biggest asset. We were warmly welcomed on arrival| and the guys at the front door were always welcoming. The breakfast was perfect for us| and the 24 hour tea/coffee and afternoon wine and cheese are a great bonus. The room was exactly as shown| everything clean and well maintained| and the beds very comfortable. Would definitely stay here again.,
1,Gem in Flatiron Districtt,The Hotel Giraffe has clean rooms and friendly| helpful staff. There are wonderful amenities including the daily wine and cheese reception| continental breakfast| and rooftop bar. The Hotel Giraffe is a delightful place to stay in midtown Manhattan.,
3,Weekend at the Giraffe,My wife and I just spent the weekend at Hotel Giraffe. We had a great stay. The prices are reasonable for the City| the rooms are comfortable and we really like the breakfast and wine reception in the lobby each day. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. It turns out that my wife left her wallet in the safe in the room (she didn’t notice it when she emptied the safe). When she called that night| the cleaning staff had found it and turned it in to the front desk.  We have stayed at the Hotel Giraffe several times and it remains our go-to hotel in Manhattan. ,
3,Amazing,Everyone is so helpful and friendly.  Location is perfect and quiet.  The continental breakfast| snacks and beverages are so convenient.  We had the deluxe suite and was very spacious and cozy.  Beds were comfortable!  Thanks for your hospitality!,
1,Exceeded all expectations!,We had our sights set on a high luxury hotel and then saw all the great reviews about Hotel Giraffe.  Our stay didn't miss a beat with the wonderful service| clean and spacious rooms and so many fun amenities such as breakfast| wine and cheese reception and constant snacks. Just loved everything about this place!  Our room was so comfy and everyone on staff was attentive and helpful.,
2,Keep coming back,Amazing as always. We return again and again to the Giraffe because of phenomenal service. The rooms and the location are great as well. But seriously love the employees. There is a nice lobby experience as well with other customers. I feel grateful to have found a home away from home in manhattan. See you again soon!,
1,Lovely Hotel,Special thanks to Jason and Gabriella who really made us feel welcome . Hotels do not function without the staff and these two members of staff make it work especially (as do the staff behind the scenes) . Would def stay here again. ,
20,Superb,The staff are magnificent and can’t do enough for you. Special mention for Gabriella who makes everyone feel special. The rooms fittings and fixtures are top notch. We had a balcony room and spent time watching New York from above. I had a bottle of wine and a birthday card waiting for me in my room which was a very nice touch. This hotel is worth every penny and also you have breakfast and wine and cheese in the evening which saves money. Stay here!,
6,New York Weekend,We really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Giraffe. We came to NYC for a long weekend with our daughter  and her husband. We were looking for a special time and this hotel did not disappoint.The staff was  pleasant and always very helpful. The room was lovely and spotlessly clean| the small balcony was a nice addition. The Library hotels always seem to be a quiet space in the busy city. The only negative I can think of| is the evening wine and cheese and breakfast served in the lobby. We have stayed at he Elysee| in the Library collection and I felt that the food choices were better and more varied| especially at the evening wine and cheese serving. Also a separate living room type area| similar to the Elysee would be nice.,
2,A real gem of a hotel,We stayed here for 3 nights this week and absolutely loved the hotel. First| the room was a good size| including a super comfortable| enormous bed so we slept well. The air con also worked beautifully and quietly - no clunking in the middle of the night as it turned on and off. The bedclothes were the right thickness for the room temperature too which is a rare thing in some hotels. And despite its central location| it was really quiet because the windows hardly let any noise through.  Breakfast was included and really good - bagels| fresh fruit (strawberries| blueberries etc)| pastries| juices etc. Not the place to come if you want a cooked brekkie but there are plenty of options available nearby.  The hotel also keeps a range of drinks and snacks available all throughout the…,
11,beautiful hotel,we had a wonderful experience here| the room was gorgeous| balcony and all| and the staff was incredible| can not recommend it highly enough. they gave us a free bottle of chilled prosecco on checking in for no reason other than to be nice.,
2,The Giraffe Hotel,Extremely nice and wonderful place to stay. Clean room| lively lobby. Wine and cheese in the evening. Wonderful breakfast. Wouldn’t stay anywhere else. Great location. Professional staff. Wonderful rooftop terrace to enjoy.,
6,A real mid-town gem,"Mid-town Manhattan has literally hundreds of hotels| and many of them are truly great. They are also truly expensive. Then there are the many that are quite good| especially for the money| but suffer from the common failing of the rooms being so small you have to step into the hall to change your mind. Hotel Giraffe is doing a pretty fine job of trying to thread the difficult needle of offering good-sized| comfortable rooms| a solid complimentary ""Continental"" buffet breakfast| personalized service| and a terrific location - all for a decent price for the area. A real standout is Jason| one of the regular doormen. I hope the Library Hotel Collection management realizes what a gem this guy is; he has the perfect personality for the job: warm| welcoming| and a genuine eagerness to…",
7,Really pleasant experience,We just returned from our stay in New York| married couple| sixty-years-old|  four nights in a suite at Hotel Giraffe| and both remarked how much we enjoyed our stay. The room size was ample to lounge and enjoy personal space while the other dressed. Initially| I feared the noise from Park Avenue| but found it not to be a problem. Also| I was less happy about going downstairs to get coffee and a continental breakfast| but found the staff to be super attentive and fast. Further| I was able to enjoy good strong latte with an added shot of espresso and a yummy toasted bagel| fruit| and meet some nice and interesting guests. The location is terrific and very conducive to exploring all parts of New York. Viva Le Giraffe!,
546,Excellently charming,The beautiful subtle decor with the delightful hearty service of the staff gives a feeling of a real boutique| although it’s not a small hotel. The rooms are large| in NY terms| with a very comfortable bed and a strong current shower. Only flaw is that they are not fully sound proof| so early morning road work sounded very loud even on the 7th floor.   There’s a complimentary buffet for breakfast and wine and cheese in the afternoon. No fitness facility but they provide a pass to a nearby gym.  An excellent value hotel in lower midtown,
82,Convivial and convenient,New York City hotel accommodation is not cheap. And midtown NYC is not usually at the top of the list of districts for accomodation. But the Hotel Giraffe struck the right balance between location| value for money and great service. The subway is just a few minutes walk away| there are a good number of restaurants closeby (including the pricey but delicious Hillstone restaurant just across the hotel on Park Avenue South). The staff were unfailingly friendly and the evening drinks and nibbles were just the thing after a day of sightseeing.  Our room at the hotel was modest in size but the bed was very comfortable. The air con worked a treat so there will be no worries if you are staying here in the middle of summer.  Hotel Giraffe deserves the great reviews it gets on…,
17,Wonderful stay,We stayed at the Hotel Giraff for 10 days in June 2019.  We were on vacation with our granddaughter who is 11 years old.  We had a balcony suite with a wonderful view.  When the balcony doors were closed| you couldn’t hear any outside noise.  The room was spacious and had a 55” inch tv in the living room and a smaller tv in the large bedroom.    Pros - the staff was incredibly friendly.  Everyone that worked at that hotel was super nice and helpful.  Can’t say enough good things about them.  The subway was a block away| which was great since that was our primary mode of transportation.  Continental breakfast saved us some money.  Con - the only con was the bathroom door was a beveled glass.  So| when you were in the bathroom sitting on the toilet| you could clearly see the…,
3,excellent value,The hotel i well situated| rooms are clean and every night Gabrielle serves you complimentary wine and cheese-always with a smile. I would stay there again without hesitation. Checkout wasn't until 1pm which was an added bonus,
4,New York Stay,Great hotel| well located for all Manhattan attractions Rooms well sized and comfortable  Evening complimentary wine and cheese along with continental breakfast were great additions to an enjoyable stay A true ‘home away from home’ in Manhattan  Staff were friendly and always responsive.,
1,Very civilzed hotel,A memorable five nights| our second stay at the Giraffe.  We brought some family with us since we enjoyed it so much the first visit. It is so pleasant to have a light breakfast and read the paper in the morning| surrounded by bustling Manhattan and yet feeling like you are in your own home. The staff is always smiling and so helpful and available for your every question or request. The evening reception was the meeting place for us| midway between our daytime outings and nightly culinary adventures.  The location is unmatched and the small scale of the hotel really suits us| and allows for that pampered feeling.  We have tried other hotels in the area| some significantly more expensive| but always like the Giraffe the most. We will be back!,
100,Great location ,Travelled with our 11 year old daughter and stayed in a Balcony King Suite| which was a reasonable size for the 3 of us as we had the sofa bed in a separate sitting area to the bedroom and a decent sized bathroom in between.  Continental breakfast was ok and is served on the ground floor by reception. Went a couple of doors up to Sarabeth’s one day for a “full on” breakfast| which was great if not a little expensive. The hotel actually has an arrangement with Sarabeth’s for delivery of breakfast to the hotel| if you want a bit more than the continental breakfast. It is pricey though. Very good location on East 26th and Park Avenue. A 15 minute walk to Empire State and the nearest Open Top Bus Tour Collection Points. Good jazz bar just around the corner on East 27th| called Jazz…,
12,Extremely comfortable| well-located,Our room was a very comfortable size| with balcony which is recommended| smallish but perfectly adequate bathroom and very comfortable bed.  Desk and large wardrobe with safe. Very little outside noise disturbance| but balcony great for seeing the world go by.  Breakfast and evening drinks in the lobby were excellent| as were all the staff - lovely and very helpful - Gabriela at breakfast was particularly obliging| and Jason the doorman.  Well-located for restaurants and subway stations uptown and down.,
7,Exceptional hotel,A fantastic hotel in so many ways! Hospitality| cleanliness| helpfulness if staff| welcome| spacious rooms| convenient location - if you are looking for an outstanding hotel within walking distance of Times Square but away from the noise and bright lights this is your hotel!,
137,Great hotel....,Booked for three nights whilst in NY on holiday.  Staff are friendly and efficient.  The early evening wine and cheese is a nice touch which gives a buzz about the place.  Breakfast is simple but adequate and good service.  Rooms are perhaps a little dated| but comfortable and well equipped.,
15,Fantastic hotel,This hotel is amazing. Everything is as you see on the website and as promised on booking. We arrived at about 6pm and it was a fast easy check in. Our room was clean| big for New York and nicely decorated. Then we went for the wine and cheese which was AMAZING such a great touch and Gabriella who runs the wine and cheese session was so friendly and helpful as were all the staff. Breakfast was also great| fruit| cereals| bagels| croissants| lots of staff on hand to help restock etc. The door staff always got us a taxi in no time. We were able to store our luggage when we checked out. The hotel has a lovely relaxed atmosphere. We are in bread and tulips and the food was lovely and again the staff were really friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay there again| cannot…,
6,Great Graduation Weekend!!,We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Giraffe!! We were in the city for our son's graduation. We were there with a party of five and every detail was perfect for us. The happy hour each day was a great place to catch up on the days activities. We had the best service from Gabriela! She knew our order and was always there with a fresh drink.  The front desk crew was helping us watch for our lost bag which was being delivered by the airline. The breakfast was great too with bottomless fresh coffee| the best fruit and amazing pastries. We are already looking forward to our next stay!! Thank you Hotel Giraffe staff for making our weekend truly memorable. ,
1,Lovely| comfortable| and excellent service,What a lovely hotel! It is small enough to feel intimate| yet big enough to offer every amenity. The service is stellar| and I had no difficulty finding someone to answer my questions| which ranged from where to eat to where to find the subway. The lobby is open in the morning for breakfast and at 5:00 pm for happy hour| which makes is one of the best features of the hotel.  The location (Park Avenue near Madison Square Park) was new to me| but I discovered great places within walking distance: Eataly and the Flatiron Building| just to name a few. The 28th Street Subway Station is just a few blocks away.   My room had a tiny balcony| and though you could not sit on it| I could open the double doors to it and listen to the sounds of the city and the thunderstorm one evening.…,
3,A New York Gem,Very comfortable| clean and spacious accommodation. Friendly| helpful and responsive staff with particular mention of Gabriella. Very nice continental breakfast served each morning and delightful cheese/wine event each evening. Very easy to use valet service to park car on arrival. Terrific location.,
9,Birthday celebrations in NY,Im writing this while sitting in the lobby of Hotel Giraffe. Our first time to the states and New York and 100% reccomend this hotel to all. Near to madison sq park| its out of the way of the main hussle and bustle of midtown and times sq| etc...and an ideal location for exploring this mad but fantastic city. The staff at the giraffe are so welcoming| it just adds to the chilled atmosphere the hotel offers. Continental breakfast is great with lots to choose from and the complimentary cheese and wine from 5pm till 7pm is superb. A family break to celebrate 18th and 21st birthdays will live long in our memories and staying at such a great hotel was the icing on the cake.,
460,Beyond excellent! ,I've stayed in plenty of hotels in New York and this is the best by a long way. It excels on many levels. We requested a quiet room on a higher floor - and| considering this is Park Avenue| we got it. Plus a decent sized room| which is a novelty in this city - well appointed too. Staff really friendly and helpful. Breakfast not extensive but certainly very adequate - and the complimentary cheese and wine in the afternoon undoubtedly welcome! Prices seem fair compared to other hotels in Manhattan. Highly recommended. ,
64,Fantastic NYC hotel,How have I been travelling to NY for years and not stayed at this hotel until now?  I love this place!  It is a four star hotel with five star service.  Every employee working at this hotel was wonderful| from the doorman to the housekeeping staff and especially Gabriella who works tirelessly to ensure that guests enjoy their breakfast and wine and cheese reception. And speaking of the wine and cheese reception| it is amazing!  Three hours every night and it’s free.  And they do not skimp on the cheese selection!  Breakfast is included as well. The hotel has suites which is very handy if you are travelling with children. Thanks for a wonderful stay| Hotel Giraffe.  I cannot wait to return and also try other hotels in this brand.,
140,Excellent hotel,Balcony superking room was a good size| very comfortable and well maintained. There were good breakfast offerings and wine and cheese at night was a nice touch after treading round New York sights all day. All the staff were very friendly and helpful and we sensed there was an air of genuine hospitality about the place. We will definitely be returning. TripAdvisor subscribers are right to rate it highly.,
41,Stunning ... ,This hotel is superb & ticks all the boxes.   Beds comfortable| rooms spacious and quiet| breakfast superb | cheese & wine fantastic   Best of all | the staff are all incredible| friendly | efficient| particularly Gabriela who looked after us superbly.  ,
19,What  loverly surprise,"We booked this place for our ""bucket list"" visit to New York. We'd never been to New York before and this place was both perfectly located and a real treat. From the moment we got there the attention to detail was excellent: it was very clean and tidy (it seemed to us that every time we left the room it was checked and made good). The shining light though was Gabriella in the longue. She worked so hard to make everything just right| not just for us but for all guests: it was very noticeable the morning she wasn't there - 3 people trying to do her job and not coping at all. My only complaint would be the price of the stay.",
1,Trendy| clean and excellent customer service.,Clean| trendy| fun and spacious for nyc. Great customer service| especially the doormen. They would run to grab us a taxi. Expert advice about the best pizza joints| the best coffee| the best speakeasy’s. Quality genuine care and interest in their business. ,
1,Great breakfast and evening wine and cheese reception,Great breakfast and helpful staff. Very clean and have a nice restaurant on site. Especially enjoyed evening wine and cheese reception. Coffee| fruits and snacks throughout the day made it easy to stay here with my ten year old. Overall great value.,
1,Charming hotel in NYC,This was our first time in NYC and we wanted somewhere quaint to stay. The property was clean and the staff were wonderful! Great location surrounded by many great restaurants and shops. Will stay again!,
1,Nice hotel with good amenities| but loud.,We enjoyed the room and thought the extra amenities were nice. We had a night cap at the hotel restaurant| which was nice. Their was a drainage issue in both the toilet and shower| but I don’t think that was the fault of the hotel. The reason we gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because it was very loud| even with a sound machine.,
49,Great Hotel| Great People,Great spot.  Excellent| friendly service.  Unbelievable breakfast and happy hour.  We try to stay here whenever we are in the City.  It may seem out of your way| but we found it to offer easy access no matter where we were headed.  ,
1,25th Wedding anniversary trip,Have just returned from a trip to New York| to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. Our stay in Hotel Giraffe was wonderful.  Clean and comfortable room| breakfast was great| and cheese and wine in the evening was really appreciated following a long day exploring a wonderful city. All the staff were really friendly and helpful| especially  the lovely lady from Slovakia who always had a smile on her face. (sorry I didn't get her name) Would recommend this Lovely hotel | is also very central. Sandra and Michael Howarth,
4,Great boutique hotel in NYC.,Great hotel.  Rooms were very comfortable and not nearly as small as I expected for a city hotel.  Our room had a sitting area separate from the sleeping area that worked out really well.  Staff was friendly and very accommodating.  ,
64,Brilliant Hotel,Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights following the recommendation of a friend and looking at the reviews. For our stay it more than achieved our expectations. Whilst it was not cheap| the service was excellent| the buffet breakfast was good and the evening wine and cheese was a fantastic way to end the day before going out in the evening - there was no restriction on the amount of wine that could be drunk nor the amount of cheese that could be eaten. The roof top area was a bonus and although the bar was not yet opened you could take coffee/wine up to it without any issues. Hotel was well located in the FlatIron district and easy walking to restaurants/the subway to other areas of the city.,
19,Little details matter,Booked a king suite for a family visit this past weekend. First time staying at the Giraffe after 2 previous stays at The Library. Everything from booking of the hotel to questions I had prior to my arrival to service while we were there was awesome! Rooms are immaculate and housekeeping staff very accommodating. In fact everyone in the hotel was so welcoming and helpful-front desk| Jose and ladies in the breakfast “room”. Our TV was not working when we returned on Sunday night and although I felt bad calling for help at 10.30 pm| a bellman came up and got it working again. All this was done with a smile! I actually want to visit NYC because of the hotel! Thank you for taking care of us. The Library Hotel chain continues to rock!,
1,New York in three days,Staff was very friendly and helpful. Nice atmosphere in lobby with live piano music during cocktail hour. The rest of the day the music in the lobby was too loud and unnecessary. The lighting in the room was a bit dark especially if you wanted to read. ,
1,Quick Business Trip,Beautiful Hotel| loved the complimentary wine & cheese as well as other snacks offered in the lobby.  Convenient location and short walk to my destination and Penn Station.  In house restaurant also had delicious food and was very convenient. Cute balcony overlooking the street too.,
25,Lovely boutique hotel,Hotel Giraffe is a lovely| quiet hotel amidst the hustle of NYC.  The continental breakfast| wine and cheese offering at night and the relaxing lobby area are all great amenities.  We asked for a quiet room| and they delivered.  We will definitely stay here again!  ,
6,Everything was perfect,Comfortable bed| luxury bathroom| plenty of closet space| not a speck of dirt in sight.  Downstairs lobby offers 24 hour espresso coffee maker| morning breakfast and evening wine and cheese.  Staff is pleasant and helpful.,
1,Great location and service,The Giraffe was perfect for us. Central location close to Metro. Friendly staff. Lovely room with a very comfortable bed| balcony and kettle to make tea. Excellent breakfast included in the tariff as well as access to a local gym. Complimentary wine and cheese tasting with live piano entertainment (the piano on some days) was an added bonus. A great boutique hotel. ,
13,Wonderful Hotel,We loved the Giraffe. We had planned a two week trip to NYC with one week at the Giraffe and one week at the Plaza. Our week at the Giraffe was great. The room was quiet and large for NYC. The staff were super friendly and helpful and we loved the breakfast and evening wine and cheese. After our week at the Giraffe| the Plaza was such a disappointment we checked out early and returned to Giraffe to finish our trip. Our three-year old loved Sam the doorman.,
4,Another satisfying stay at the Giraffe!,This was my third stay at the Giraffe. The staff was very welcoming and helpful| and at least a couple of the employees remembered me from my previous visits. Being that I was in NYC| I| of course| had some questions regarding the subway| and the front desk staff gave me answers that were clear and helpful. The personnel who worked the complimentary breakfasts and wine hours were friendly and efficient| and they went out of their way to please. (Gabriela deserves special acknowledgement!) Furthermore| the housekeepers were at the top of their game as my room was spotless each day. The entire staff seemed to enjoy working at the Giraffe| and this was reflected in the service they gave me. I will definitely stay at the Giraffe when I return to NYC. Thank you!  (One complaint: My…,
2,Excellent staff,Have stayed at this girl several times now. The staff makes sure that every need is met in a friendly| cheerful manner. The hotel is clean and comfortable. Love the wine and cheese in the evening after a day of business and how they remember you from previous trips. My 2nd home in New York.,
12,smooth and easy,"first time at this hotel; selected for location / will probably repeat visit because of high  degree of professionalism in satisfying guests.  facilities underscored by convenience albeit a tad ""aged"". and aging hippy/young professional vibe. good public space and a lovely terrace on 12th floor that's a ""god send"" to cigar smokers.",
2,Great location,Just a short 30 minutes cab ride from LaGuardia airport (around $50 USD) Right on Park Avenue South near many restaurants. Walking distance to anything you need. Small hotel but decent size room. Clean and well kept.,
4,Comfortable and Welcoming,I have stayed at the Hotel Giraffe many times over the years.  The staff - at both the front desk and in the breakfast room - is always welcoming and kind. The rooms are spotlessly clean and the beds are very comfortable with good quality sheets and pillows.  The lobby breakfast area is large and so cheerful| with good coffee and continental breakfast and the NY Times.  A great place to pass some time in the morning.  I have stayed at many NY hotels -- some very flashy and edgy -- but this is my favorite place| because of it's calm| organized| relaxed| solid service and comfortable rooms. ,
1,Consistent excellence,Unexpected upgrade to suite for our 5 day stay. My wife and I have stayed here during our annual nyc visit for some time now; staff makes it feel like home. Seems as if it would be waste of tome to stay anywhere else. Location hard to beat.,
141,Bring earplugs,This is a quaint boutique hotel with small rooms and a small bathroom lacking a stall shower.  The bagel breakfast is OK as is the fruit that is available in the lobby. The staff is polite. The problem is that the windows have no sound protection and the hotel faces busy Park Avenue South. Expect to be wakened at 5:30 AM with loud truck noises. Why don’t they soundproof the windows?,
25,Fabulous Weekend Getaway,We met up with friends from Boston for a weekend getaway in NYC. We chose The Giraffe Hotel for its location| amenities| and price. We could not have been happier with the results. The staff was incredibly friendly (especially the lovely woman serving breakfast and afternoon wine/cheese)| and the room was spacious for NYC standards. We had a lovely outdoor balcony complete with geranium plants blooming!  The continental breakfast was much appreciated and the Italian coffee maker produced excellent lattes and espressos. A nice selection of breads| fresh fruit| hard-boiled eggs| muffins| pastries and juices was presented and constantly replenished. We are in the lovely lobby but we were offered a tray to take breakfast to our room if we so chose.  The hotel is located in a great…,
2,Outstanding service and wonderful property.,Four of us recently had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Giraffee in NYC| and we had an excellent experience. From the minute we walked in from the rain| the staff met or exceeded our expectations and did so with warm smiles and conversation. The first floor longue provided a nice spot for afternoon coffee and biscuits| and the pianist the first evening provided a wonderful soothing vibe. The wine and chesse evenings| hosted by Gabriella| were lovely. Service was top notch and as soon as we were thinking we might want some more wine or snacks| she was one step ahead of us and there to offer drinks. The staff at the breakfasts were equally attentive (although breakfast was more crowded)| and the front desk and housekeeping staff were exceptionally pleasant as well. The small…,
1,Fabulous Stay at the Hotel Giraffe,My mom| sister| and I stayed here recently for my sister's 30th birthday and we had a truly marvelous time. We got a king suite with a sitting room and a pullout couch. The king bed was very comfortable| as was the pullout couch| but my mom said her pillow felt like a rock all night.   There was a bottle of sparkling white wine waiting for us in our room when we arrived and my sister was truly touched by this gesture. I did notice it was the same wine that they gave away for free during wine and cheese hours| but it was still a nice touch to have it in our room. We also went down for wine and cheese and the bartender was amazing: a lovely spirit and great attitude. There were some cookies left over that were sitting behind the bar and when I asked about them she allowed me to…,
1,A fantastic find!,The location of the hotel was fantastic| but the staff and amenities are what made the hotel an incredible place to stay. Exceptionally warm staff members saw to our every need. Our room was spacious and comfortable. The in-room and lobby amenities (complimentary happy hour| snacks and breakfast) were wonderful. ,
29,A wonderful stay,Third time in this cosy hotel| perfectly located. Nice breakfast and very successful idea of having “aperitivo” hours in late afternoon! Very kind and organised staff and comfortable rooms!!! Hope to come back soon ,
1,Friendly Hotel,We were first time guest and enjoyed  the warm touches and friendly staff. Loved Fig and Olive  restaurant for lunch. Also enjoyed the breakfast that was served in a lobby area. We felt like home and enjoyed chatting with the other guest.,
1,My go-to hotel in NYC,I was lucky enough to discover the Hotel Giraffe on my second trip to New York City (the first was spent in a glorified closet someone considered a hotel room)| and it’s been my hotel if choice ever since. The rooms are lovely and decently sized| the staff is fantastic| and the location is great (and very close to several subway stops). ,
2,Absolutely perfect,We were so lucky to receive a room upgrade; the king suite is a beautiful room with fabulous views. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was included and we chose to have it in our room.. the portions are very generous and it was delicious. We also enjoyed the wine and cheese on offer from 5-8pm. I will definitely go back at the next opportunity,
7,Lovely Hotel,Lovely hotel| very friendly and helpful staff| great neighborhood.  Rooms are well kept and they will provide many extras on request.  Continental breakfast is well tended to| and the all day snacks is a nice touch.  Wine and cheese in the evening is also well tended to and at check-in when we shared that we were meeting local friends for afternoon| the staff said we should feel free to invite them to the evening reception.  We will be back!,
123,Amazing 1st anniversary in the big apple,Amazing experience staying with Hotel Giraffe. From start to finish everything was smooth| friendly and comfortable Gaby who is on the front desk is a superstar - from the time of booking| arrange airport transport and even making a few arrangements such as wine in the room for our anniversary   Lovely location hotel| rooms| with the added bonus of breakfast and evening cheese/wine  The hotels roof garden is a welcome| quiet relaxing space  Can’t wait to go back ,
59,Loved the Hotel Giraffe ,Just back from a 5night stay at the Hotel Giraffe. What an incredible hotel the location is just perfect and the complimentary breakfast a great start to a busy day ahead. We walked from the hotel to Madison Square Park and enjoyed a burger in Shake Shack watching the colourful Easter light display at the Empire State Building ..what a memory to make !! We also ate in Bread and Tupils and Blue Smoke for a family of four these were ideal. The hotel rooms were fab and we loved the balcony overlooking Park Ave. The beds were possibly the most comfortable we have slept in. After the hustle and bustle of sightseeing in the city we escaped to the tranquility of the hotel and enjoyed the wine and snacks provided by the hotel and a welcoming smile from Gabriela who is definitely a…,
4,Fabulous| Friendly Boutique Hotel in a Central Location,We stayed here while taking my daughter on college tours. It was close enough to NYU to walk and a quick cab ride to Fordham. She wanted to shop and we easily covered a lot of the top shopping locations| and then came back to a relaxing living room for cheese and crackers and drinks. The complimentary breakfast was also a great help| allowing us to grab something quickly before heading out to appointments. The staff was incredibly friendly and our room was spacious and lovely. Thank you to the fantastic staff at the Hotel Giraffe. We will definitely be back!,
94,Wonderful New Year trip,Great location and utterly wonderful cheese and wine each evening before heading out on the town.  The staff are charming and very hard working.  The rooms and bathrooms are great| very spacious for New York hotels and the beds are big and super comfy.    I would highly recommend this place| walkable to pretty much everywhere| great service and very welcoming.  I would return here!,
5,Excellent stay at the Hotel Giraffe,We spent five nights at the Hotel Giraffe in NYC. We have stayed at the hotel previously and chose the hotel again hoping for another excellent stay. The hotel didn't disappoint. Our room was spotless and a very good size for New York. Particular thanks to the door staff for welcoming us so warmly each time we returned to the hotel and to Gabriela for running an excellent wine and cheese reception each night. Although Gabriela was busy| she took time to speak to each of the guests| which made the atmosphere even more welcoming. ,
8,Great Stay,We stayed at Hotel Giraffe this week. The hotel is beautiful and very clean. Staff was professional and kind. The concierge came up to room to bring cuff links| was able to tie my son’s tie because I didn’t know how| then he removed his own tie clip and put it on my adult son| who didn’t have one. Everything was perfect. Hotel restaurant Bread and Tulips has delicious pizza| but the pasta we ordered was not edible.  ,
1,Outstanding Oasis in Manhattan,This is our third stay and every time we love it.  We love the service| the valet parking| wine and cheese| Continental breakfast| the rooms| and all of the staff.      We will definitely stay again.  (We allow love the sister hotels in NYC!),
7,Here is to the long necks!,This hotel has it all| It is quiet and has just enough of a giraffe theme. The staff was excellent from the hostess to the doorman! The locais excellent and the restaurants are over the top. We visited six in two days all in walking distance! ,
4,Gabriela is awesome!,Many positives - just listing a few. Gabriela| who works at breakfast and wine and cheese hour in the lobby| is absolutely wonderful. She's truly terrific. The rooms are nicely appointed| a bit on small side| but the lobby is a great public space.   Negatives: The elevators can be slow at time and the stairs are not conducive to guests. ,
4,Great Place to Stay in NYC,This was our first time staying at The Hotel Giraffe| although we have been visiting NYC every couple of years for many years. Friends who stay at this hotel recommended it highly| and now we will do the same!  The staff was helpful| friendly and responsive| and the rooms were clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the breakfast each morning and the cocktail hour in the afternoons. The lobby was a nice place to sit and visit. The location had convenient access to the subway.  We'll definitely stay here again!,
125,First Visit| will definitely return,Decided to give this place a try after reading about it on Trip Advisor. The staff was extremely courteous and professional. Our room was beautiful and well appointed. I should mention that when you make your reservation you get to pick from a checklist as to what you might want to have in your room (coffee machine| type of pillows| and many other choices).  The Hotel is located very close to the 28th street subway station (6 line). Several very good restaurants nearby.  Loved the morning breakfast and the evening reception.  Will definitely return next time I'm in the city.,
1,Fantastic Hotel in ideal Manhattan location for exploring NY.,Stayed at Giraffe with wife and two daughters in their 2 double bed rooms with balcony.  We arrived before check-in time but were allowed to relax in the lobby and enjoy complimentary tea| coffee and pastries whilst room was prepared.  Room was very clean.  All hotel staff were very friendly.  Complimentary breakfast| all day coffee and pastries and evening wine and cheese were high quality. On our last day there was no problem in leaving our bags| etc. at the hotel so we could spend the day in NY before collecting them and setting off to JFK.  Would stop here again.,
9,Perfection in NYC,We have travelled to NYC many times and have always struggled to find the perfect mix of price| location| size and amenities. This hotel is perfection! The service is exceptional.  The morning breakfast is great and the staff is welcoming and so helpful. In the evening they offer a wine and cheese which quickly became something we looked forward to. 24/7 coffee| tea and cookies in the lobby is an amazing perk!  We love it here and will be back!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!,
19,Still great!,This is our fourth visit. One of the best things about this hotel is the caliber of the staff. Whether front desk| bellhop or the breakfast bar attendants| they are uniformly gracious| friendly and helpful. The housekeeping is excellent| the continental breakfast is full and the lobby is both elegant and welcoming. Sometimes it can be difficult to find a place to sit with your breakfast if the room is busy| but it always works out somehow. The location is convenient to midtown| the East Village| and the 23rd St subway station. You will not be disappointed.,
85,First stay - not our last!,Just stayed here 4 nights with friends and family. In a king suite which gave us a superking bed in a separate bedroom and a very comfortable sofabed (with topper) in the lounge. Plenty of wardrobe space and lots of room to move about for us 3 ladies.  Very adequate breakfast in the lobby and nice wine and cheese at 5pm. All staff very courteous and helpful and a thoroughly pleasant stay. Will definitely return,
3,Hotel Giraffe,The Giraffe once again was excellent. The staff is the best | in our experience. The rooms are are made available to us quickly| and they are spotless. Breakfast and wine/cheese hour served by Gabby and her staff are always enjoyable.She has a great personality. Once again a memorable time in New York.,
1,Warm and welcoming,We recently spent 2 nights at the Hotel Giraffe and found it a very friendly place! From the moment we pulled up in a rainstorm we were whisked into the lobby. After a 4 hour drive it was lovely to be offered beverages| tea| coffee| glass of wine and a variety of snacks at 10:30 pm. The rooms are spacious and well equipped. The breakfast offered in the morning is just enough to start your day relaxed and the staff and other guests were all very friendly. We will be back!,
1,Our Go-To Hotel in NYC,We love this hotel and always stay here when visiting NYC.  The hotel is perfectly located for shopping| theater| subways| parks.  The staff is outstanding| and the breakfast and wine and cheese in the evening is a lovely start to the day and relaxing finish to a day roaming around NY.  It is a gem. ,
1,Excellent service,The personal and friendly service from the entire team at Hotel Giraffe made our stay a pleasure.  Coupled with a great midtown location; relaxed and informal breakfasts / cheese & wine evenings; and an excellent 2 bedroom corner suite we couldn't have made a better choice.,
4,Good servive,Good service | Breakfast perfect| all staff very kinds . Service by gorgeous young people.helpful people at front desk and staff at the door|price commensurate with location | if I have times | I will be comeback,
37,Outstanding Boutique Hotel,We greatly enjoyed our six night stay. The king suite was very comfortable| and the continental breakfast| cookies and evening wine and cheese were much appreciated. The ladies assisting with the breakfast are hard working and pleasant. Thanks.,
11,My new favorite,Low key perfection. From the moment we stepped off the street and into the lobby| I felt cocooned in comfort. There was no need unconsidered. We enjoyed valet parking| snacks and drinks| Sarabeth's for brunch right downstairs (and they deliver!) and a nice Italian restaurant in the basement for which we received a 20% discount. The room was lovely and quiet and comfortable. We will be back| soon.,
1,Great Find,They go out of their way to make you feel welcome| and accomodate special needs better than most places we have stayed. Breakfast is perfect and we love the location.  We stay here every time we go into NYC,
2,Second stay and we’ll be back!,This was our second stay at The Giraffe and it was just as special as we remembered. The staff makes you feel like family and all the luxurious extras are appreciated. Gabby serving wine in the evening is the best! ,
2,fun time,Enjoyed out stay| great location. Room clean up was a little late on Saturday but we were very pleased with the hotel.  The wine hour is a nice touch and we will recommend this hotel to others in the future.,
114,Location and ambiance| great service,Second time here| in a king corner balcony suite. Excellent location on Park Avenue. Love the all day cookies and coffee| the continental breakfast and happy hour| and rarel had to wait even a minute for an elevator. Very helpful staff. I could get coffee (or tea| cappuchino| lattes or filtered in a carafe)  at all hours in the lobby| but would have appreciated a kettle in the room.  We celebrated our 45th Anniversary this 4 night trip.,
1,Lovely hotel,We enjoyed 5 nights at this great friendly hotel. Fantastic relaxed breakfasts. Cheese and wine was a nice addition in the evenings. Great location for visiting various places of interest. I thoroughly recommend this hotel.,
56,Comfortable Hotel,My husband does not go in lifts so I contacted the New York Tourist board and a lovely chap replied suggesting I contact three or four hotels| details of which he provided. They were all helpful but I chose The Giraffe by The Library Collection and they sent me a very detailed description of the room choices that were accessible by stairs. Our room was on the second floor| the lobby being on the first at street level so just a few steps to walk up and we had a balcony which was a bonus. Lovely spacious clean room| comfortable bed and good housekeeping. Room 203 which was opposite the stairs and lift if needed. Good choice of continental breakfast| complimentary hot drinks (help yourself) day and night and cheese and wine reception every evening around 5.30pm. Polite helpful…,
2,Comfortable environment a home away from home,A small hotel with a comfortable feel in the heart of Manhattan. It does not have a bar which makes the downstairs lobby space more cozy and less noisy. The fact a continental breakfast| afternoon tea and evening cheese and wine are all complimentary in the downstairs lobby area makes it feel a fully inclusive space,
2,wonderful hotel!,I have stayed her many times and now feel like it's a home away from home.  The rooms are lovely and the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating.  They go out of their way to meet your needs.  It's a small hotel and they have created a lovely ambiance.  And| it's located in a great area of the city - close to restaurants| shopping and cultural attractions.,
75,We love this place,This is where we stay now. Great location in Flatiron district| just off Madison Park and very near the 6 subway. Everyone on the staff is great. Great housekeeping| lovely breakfast and wine and cheese spreads.,
1,Great location friendly hotel,Very nice friendly hotel. Very helpful and nice staff working at the hotel. Great location close to nice restaurants| stores and parks. Big rooms. Good breakfast and really nice with the complimentary wine and cheese between 5 pm to 8 pm.,
22,Wonderful accommodations,The Hotel Giraffe is clean| rooms large by New York standards| provides a myriad of services and has exceptional staff. Everything about Hotel Giraffe is high quality but the morning and evening host| Gabriela| is the icing on the cake. She clearly relates to everyone from a little girl about 3| who ran to hug Gabriela| to the elderly. If you want an overall commendable experience| I recommend the Hotel Giraffe.,
9,Wonderful stay in New York City!,I’ve stayed at many hotels in Manhattan and this is by far the best and the best value.  Rooms are very comfortable and big (not like so many where you can’t even turn around).  The service is excellent and everyone who works there is courteous and helpful.  Breakfast is included (and good) and we enjoyed the wine and cheese in the afternoon.  It’s a hotel the doesn’t try too hard but really gets it right.  Location is great too - not far from Soho| etc or from mid-town. Good restaurants nearby. ,
6,Perfect Location| Amazing Service,Stayed for 8 nights while we saw all the sights. The location was perfect for exploring the city and we enjoyed both the free continental breakfast in the morning and the wine and cheese spread in the evening. The room was comfortable and clean and remarkably quiet. Perfect for our family. We would definitely stay here again.,
1,Spring Break in NYC,Our stay at Hotel Giraffe was wonderful!  It was very comfortable| quiet| and clean.  We enjoyed the breakfast and evening receptions - Ariety and Gaby (two of the hostesses) were exceptional!  It was in a great location for seeing the sights!  ,
1,Love The Giraffe Hotel,Always a pleasure to stay here. From Jose at the front door to Gabriella who makes us feel as if we are sitting in our living room at the end of a hard day's work| everyone of the staff members at The Giraffe are welcoming| warm and always ready to assist in any way. Been staying here for many years and always happy to return. ,
3,Always a great stay at The Giraffe Hotel,This is the second time my daughter and I have stayed at this customer service centered hotel. From opening the door to greet you until you leave| they can’t do enough. One of our great experiences was the cocktail server during the wine & cheese reception. Gabriella was still the brightest part of both our trips to The Giraffe. ,
834,Like home,A wonderful and friendly hotel. Staff treats visitors with respect and are helpful and friendly. The tea and cookies and the wine evening are all a wonderful homey touch. Rooms are clean and large. The bathrooms are a bit dated but large and good lighting. A well located hotel with a good restaurant attached.,
12,Another Fantastic Stay,As always| the Hotel Giraffe delivers!  We are loyal guests of Hotel Giraffe and never consider staying anywhere else when we visit NYC.   The staff are friendly and go above and beyond to ensure that we feel welcome and all of our needs are met.   The rooms are always spotless and housekeeping does a wonderful job of keeping the room clean during our stay without being obtrusive.  Hotel Giraffe is our home away from home when we visit the NYC.   ,
2,Great Place,We loved the room details.  Helpful staff.  Reasonably priced for NYC.  Love the 3-hour happy hour and 24/7 snacks in the lobby.  Good location and not too noisy.  Similar to Library Hotel but even better.   Would definitely return.,
1,Great stay!,My wife and spent 6 nights in this hotel. Staff is very attentive and pleasant. Breakfast is good and diversified enough to please all tastes. Wine and cheese aperitif is a very pleasant moment in particular when the piano is played. The situation is also a strong point to choose this hotel in central Manhattan very close to metro line n°6. We may be back in this town in the future and surely we'll choose the same hotel.,
1,One of the best places to stay in NYC,This is a wonderful hotel. Excellent location| wonderful service.  Very cozy. The staff are extremely friendly and efficient.  Breakfast is just what you need. Excellent restaurants around the corner. 5 O'Clock drinks...   Can't ask for more.,
2,Birthday overnight,My husband and i spent one night at the Giraffe recently| to celebrate my birthday. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there| the staff was so friendly yet professional| and we felt important in such a large city environment. The balcony was a huge plus| since the weather had turned pleasant after a long| cold winter. The wine and cheese reception was great| and the breakfast was fresh and plentiful. The staff at both events were attentive and so helpful. I can't say anything negative! Price quality was through the roof! Totally recommend this hotel. Thanks!,
6,Birthday fun,I came for one night to celebrate my birthday. the evening happy hour was great to receive my friends and the Morning breakfast was excellent. Wonderful service - all staff were amazing. It’s in a great location| too. Recommended for a special occasion if you want to hang out in the flat iron/union sq district.,
2,Great. To make 200 characters ghggggggggggggggggggggggggggggygggyggyyyyygyyyyyyyyyyyyyyhhyhhhuhuhhyuyhhuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,The wine and cheese was wonderful. The breakfast was good. The coffee was really good. The bed was great. The staff were all Very courteous and attentive. Reservations were easy. Confirmation was timely. Location worked for us. In room cooler was a plus.,
8,Great stay,Comfortable bed| comfortable and bright room| great staff| excellent location and reasonable price for NYC. Highly recommend. Walkable to subway| restaurants| theaters| sights. Not much else to ask for.,
1,Spring break 2019,Could not have been happier with the location| easy access to subway and walking to midtown and the west side was a quick walk.Staff were attentive and friendly. Rooms very clean and housekeeping staff did an excellent job daily. Breakfast and evening reception hosts were top notch service!,
136,Great again,Came in early December for our second visit to the hotel to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. Pleased to say It was as excellent as in 2016. We even had the same room. Clean| comfortable and excellent staff.,
13,Now we have tried all the NY Library Collection Hotels!,The Library Hotel on Madison and 41st has been a favorite for years| but in the past year we decided to try the others -- Elysee| Casablanca| and this past weekend|  Giraffe. All share the same culture and amenities -- very friendly and helpful staff and very comfortable rooms| bedding| and baths -- and the wonderful continental breakfast and wine hours. All are conveniently located near places of interest. I think our favorite is still the Library; as retired academics we love being surrounded by books everywhere. But all are pleasant. The only down side of the Giraffe is that its public room is on the ground floor| whereas all the others have it on the floor above -- maybe a matter of personal preference. Any of the four is a good bet and in fact the prices are a little lower…,
1,Lived up to the reputation,This is my new favorite NYC hotel! Everything that we read about the staff| cleanliness and service was completely accurate. I really liked the high ceiling in our double queen room along with the simple| but modern| furnishings and decor. This is also a great neighborhood for travelers that want to be centrally located in Manhattan with easy access to restaurants| the subway and a park.,
17,Soothing sophistication,I enjoy staying at this hotel! The staff was always  professional| friendly and ready to help make my stay comfortable and pleasant.  The location of the hotel was excellent| easy access to  public transportation and great restaurants. This NoMad neighborhood was just so pleasant. Although the decore of the rooms are nice I would recommend a freshen up. Check some of the mirrors they seem to have peeling in the back and some of the sheets were tattered . Overall I’m headed back for the next three weeks where I’ll stay Wednesday’s to Friday. Victor ,
1,It wonderful hotel! The rooms were decently sized and the service was exceptional. Will stay here again next time in New,Great room decent size. Hotel stuff very helpful. Wonderful breakfast and afternoon wine and cheese. The only thing I don’t understand Is why I have to have 200 characters before they will except my review thank you,
13,Great experience again,the registration staff was great and of course Gabriella greeted us warmly on our first night there|  We always love the comfortable beds and pillows!   The breakfasts are wonderful and the evening cheese and wine were welcomed! ,
2,A stay at the Giraffe.,Nice property. Great little rustic Italian restaurant on ground floor. Nice wine and cheese hour and good breakfast in a pleasant lobby. I enjoyed my stay. Staff was lovely and room was clean with ample closet space. ,
1,visit broadway and SOHO and TRIBECA,very pleasant| second stay and it was better than first; already booked for November 2019; the room was perfect size; front desk gave us an early checkin so we could dress for HAMILTON; the breakfast was great and the wine and cheese was as we always expected it; staff very attentive and were always asking if they could do anything to make stay memorable; recommend hotel to our friends.,
1,Great stay!,The staff was wonderful! The accommodations were fantastic! I just wish the bar stayed open later... but that’s fine! NYC has tons of bars to get into! Our rooms were always clean or turned down and the coffee was delicious! Will def go again!,
1,Excellent service.,Very generous with snacks and drinks. The breakfast is excellent and healthy. Coffee is just what you need for a full day in the city. You can walk anywhere from the hotel or short walk to the subway station. We loved it. ,
7,Amaizing,Absolutely loved my stay at Hotel Giraffe| will definitely go back in a couple of months.   I was there for the New York City half marathon with my husband and son and we all enjoyed our stay| the room was fabulous and the staff couldn't of been more attentive and courteous,
13,New York Comfort,This is a fabulous boutique hotel - walking distance to everything that is NYC| awesome restaurants near by including their very own Bread and Tulips|  Gr8 service| Gr8 breakfast| Gr8 evening wine bar with host Gabi who makes sure you have a most relaxing evening of wine and nibbles,
46,Very classy nyc hotel!,Loved this hotel| very classy and good service! They held our bags when we got there before we checked in and held them for us the day we left.  They have coffee 24/7 and cheese| snacks and wine every night with a piano player and everything!  The breakfast was great| they had very good nyc style bagels. It's the whole works! Very nice location| we enjoyed our stay!,
310,Great room size,Stayed for a couple of nights| the room was big with a decent sized bed and lounge area. The additional touches like free wine and cheese every evening| snacks and the service really set it apart from others in NYC I have stayed in. Great location too.,
1,Great hotel and good location,Staff was very friendly and super accommodating.  My kids enjoyed themselves.  I loved the free champagne in the lobby daily. Hotel was very quiet.  Good location 1.5 mile walk to Rockefeller center.  Would definitely stay here again.,
180,Believe the reviews - what a hotel,I just returned home from a 5-night stay at the Hotel Giraffe. What an extraordinary boutique hotel - the best in NYC and one of my favorite city hotels anywhere! I was traveling solo and everything was top-notch: lovely room| warm and friendly service from everyone - from doorman to lounge host to room attendants - and special amenities like yummy breakfast and happy hour bites/pianist. The Giraffe had a perfect blend of luxury comfort with no stuffiness or snootiness.  The location was excellent| too: a 5-10 minute walk to multiple subways and in the heart of of very vibrant area that was a nice change from the Upper East Side and West Side. The Giraffe will be my new “go to” in NYC. Thank you| everyone for a memorable stay.,
27,Another wonderful stay at the Hotel Giraffe!,We had a lovely stay at the Hotel Giraffe and enjoyed both the evening wine and cheese and the delicious breakfast each day - our room was well appointed and quiet... and the hotel location is absolutely perfect!,
1,This hotel is a gem.,I have stayed at the Giraffe twice and both times were excellent. The staff is very attentive| the rooms are beautiful and the property is something rare for NYC - quiet!  They upgraded my room during the week when it was quiet just because they could| and didn't charge me more for it| which I really appreciated.  The breakfast and happy hour plus coffee/ tea| fruit and cookies always available in the lobby make it feel like home.  The Hotel Giraffe is definitely my one and only choice for visiting my daughter in New York City!,
1,Perfect - they thought of everything.,Every employee was friendly| kind and efficient.  The breakfast and hors d’ were generous and inviting.  Everyone talks about service but they certainly deliver.  The rooms were attractive with every thing one needed.  ,
3,4-night stay at the Hotel Giraffe,I have stayed at this hotel before and enjoyed it very much. Reasonable price| big comfortable room| helpful front desk/concierge. The wine and cheese complimentary happy hour was a very nice touch| and the morning breakfast was| too. (Both are served in the hotel lobby.),
1,Trip of a Life time,After much research| we picked this hotel based on the many wonderful reviews we had read and were not disappointed. The location was great| an easy walk to a few subway lines and too many wonderful restaurants to choose from in our 9 night stay.  The morning breakfast was a perfect light start to the day but it was the evening cheese and wine that made our stay that much more special due to the hospitality of Gabriela. She is a wonderful asset to Hotel Giraffe person and we cannot wait to stay here again.,
16,Great experience ,Hotel Giraffe gave us the best service and amenities we could have asked for.  I have stayed at many many Manhattan hotels is this one does it right!  From the complimentary wine and cheese to the piano player to the amazing two bedroom suite we had| they didn’t miss a beat.  Thank you to the staff and management! ,
2,Amazing hotel and staff,The hotel is located in a very nice area| and the location on manhattan is perfect| especially if you like to walk.   Our flight to NY was cancelled and our 4 nights stay was therefore moved to one day later. We had booked a non-refundable stay through hotels.com| but the hotel fixed this without any extra charges. Awsome service!  We initially got a very dark and sad suite (which we actually had booked)| but when we asked for a better view we got a balcony suite overlooking park avenue| again with no extra charge. I would highly recommend the balcony suite over the one with no balcony. It is far brighter and it offers great views! We didn't think we needed a balcony since it was the coldest March in a long time| but the light and the views alone makes it worth the extra bucks. …,
6,Favorite nyc Hotel,Always the best hotel!! The staff are so friendly and helpful and always remember us. The wine and cheese is so nice in the evening and we appreciate the breakfast. The rooms are always very clean and comfortable and it’s a great neighborhood! Highly recommended! We always stay here when in town!|!,
3,March Vacation,One of best hotels we have stayed in. Been to NYC 9 times. Gaberilla in the morning and even reception was an outstanding host. The remainder of the hotel staff were also always nice and accommodating. Room amenities| bed and bath were all top notch. Excellent location.,
24,Wonderful hotel,The Hotel Giraffe surpassed all expectations. From the helpfulness of reception arranging transport from the airport| to accommodating a special request for my husband's birthday. The rooms are a lot bigger then an average NYC hotel room| with plenty of storage. The complimentary breakfast and wine and cheese evenings are a delight| with a particular mention to Gabrielle the hostess who was just wonderful. She was attentive to all guests and nothing was too much trouble.  Definitely a new favourite for NYC stays!,
47,Fabulous Friendly Hotel,My husband and I and our 2 adult children stayed at Hotel Giraffe for 3 nights.  The staff were fabulous - everyone is so friendly and accommodating.  Particular thanks to the wonderful Gabrielle who looked after us so well during the fabulous morning breakfast and evening cheese and wine (which is all complimentary).  The rooms were a good size and spotlessly clean.  The beds so comfy. It is ideally situated near the Flat Iron district away from the busy crowds on 5th Avenue and Central Park| but within easy walking distance to all that NY has to offer and close to two subways.  We absolutely loved it and we were so glad we choose Hotel Giraffe.  Thank you to all the staff.,
1,Always the Best!,This hotel has been my first choice NY hotel since my first stay when it first opened.  The staff from the doorman's greeting to the front desk to the housekeeping is the finest!  I will be back in the spring| and looking forward to it!,
81,5 stars for value and friendliness,This is a 5 star hotel for the value received based upon the cost.   The staff is unbelievably friendly and helpful.  The rooms are nice but not luxury or true 5 star.  There is a robust continental breakfast and a nice offering for the wine hour.  (The snacks are good| wine is a very basic brand).  I am rating this 5 stars for value.,
11,Total Package Boutique Hotel,My second time staying at Hotel Giraffe after several years and it stands up to the test of time in service| price| location and comfort.  We stayed in a suite and enjoyed the space and views outside two sides.  The staff make the hotel - and we were pleased by the reception from arrival to departure. ,
16,Perfect location within reach of everywhere in Manhattan,In a way| I'm a little reluctant to share this review. Its a very friendly well placed hotel in the middle of Manhattan - perfect for walking almost everywhere.   The Giraffe was recommended to us| and we in turn have recommended to others. It doesn't have the grandeur of some of New York's large hotels or the corporate feel of the group hotels. Its footprint is relatively small and there is only really a lounge come breakfast area at the entry. Its very understated| but perfectly placed| very friendly and very clean. You'll see why it is rated so highly on TA.,
1,Gem of a Hotel in Flatiron,I stayed at Hotel Giraffe in February 2019 thanks to the recommendation of a friend. Everything exceeded my expectations. The price was very competitive| my room was clean| comfortable| well appointed and charming. So much better than staying at a large chain hotel - as I have done in the past. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the daily breakfast and evening wine reception were great bonuses. Location could not be better; in the middle of excellent restaurants and just around the corner from the subway. Also walking distance from many of the things I wanted to do and see and from my business appointments too. I will absolutely stay here again and highly recommend.,
6,Perfectly located quality Hotel,Hotel Giraffe simply ticked every box for a first time visitor in New York. The location is hard to improve on| bringing most of the key sites in walking distance. We only resorted to the subway twice. The rooms are large| pleasant| clean| quiet and have very comfortable beds. Service is top draw. Do not underestimate the value and convenience of the included breakfasts and the wine and snacks in the evening. The hotel is not that large| has a lovely ambience and manages to achieve quality without falling into formality. If you are new to New York and wondering which hotel to pick| you really cannot go wrong with hotel Giraffe.,
2,Best boutique hotel anywhere!,The Giraffe is like a second home.  My husband and I have stayed there many times over the years and would never stay anyplace else in New York.  It is an oasis of quiet| calm| and personal attention  amidst the crowds| noise| and zing of New York City.  It has had many of the same staff people during the years we have gone there| which says something about it as well.  It is in a great location| easy walking to downtown or uptown| has wonderful amenities (wine and cheese service every afternoon in their living room-like lobby. to name just one). comfortable and cozy rooms| and wonderfully friendly staff.  I could live there!,
1,A Gem Hotel Stay in NYC,Some of the best| most attentive service in my over 5 decades of travel in 46 countries & 13 cruises. Hotel Giraffe is a gem at the corner of 26th Street & Park Avenue| NYC... Availability of 24/7 snacks & Continental Breakfast| complimentary Wall Street Journal & New York Times are additional examples of dedication to customer satisfaction...,
9,Third time's a charm,This was our third visit to the Hotel Giraffe in the past 12 months - and it never disappoints. We arrived early after an international flight through the night| exhausted and found that they allowed us to get in our room early. The robes and towels are highest quality and the bed so comfortable. We love the breakfast provided and the evening happy hour with wine and appetizers is delightful. From the moment we are greeted at the door to the moment we reluctantly say goodbye| everyone is delightful. We will be back - soon!,
1,Great Stay,We enjoyed our weekend staying at the Hotel Giraffe in NYC.  Friendly staff| great location.  Our room was just as we viewed online| clean| nicely appointed.  The hotel was quiet. It was nice to come back in the evening to bed turned down and have soft music playing in the room.  We would definitely stay there again.,
4,Great once again,Everything was terrific as always.  Friendly staff| nice family atmosphere| not too big.  Having coffee and snacks available throughout the day is a plus and a free NYTimes on Sunday morning is appreciated.  Whenever I am in NYC with my wife we try to stay here and do so when rates are attractive.  The rates are quite variable as is true for most of NYC on a regular basis.  The location is outstanding for us as it is a bit away from the drama of midtown| but convenient to great food and very fun things to do.,
4,Flatiron Boutique Gem,Service was impeccable. Room was beautiful. Enjoyed breakfast| wine and cheese and piano player. Fantastic coffee machine in lobby. Welcoming property. Would definitely return and recommend. Excellent location; near subway| restaurants and Eat Italy.,
6,Great hotel!,Hotel Giraffe is a well located| lovely hotel with nice added extras like wine & cheese in the evenings| snacks/hot drinks all day and breakfast. The room is a good size for NY and reasonably priced. The restaurant next door did beautiful food. Hotel staff are very friendly too :),
12,What a lovely hotel and located where we wanted.,The daughter was off for winter break and we wanted to go SOMEPLACE.  So| checking for the cheapest flights we narrowed it down to New York.  Now we need a hotel...Giraffe had a room that sounded like it solved our sleeping problem| 701 (there may be others like it) has a fold out bed and a master with a king and a DOOR between them.  Perfect.  Price was better than I expected as well.    I don't have ANY negatives about this hotel| so here are the things we liked:  -We never encountered an employee who wasn't immediately helpful.  The concierges all knew what they were doing and got us everything from cabs to ice in mere minutes.  The maids were very nice and worked around our hectic schedule.  -I will call out Gabriella in particular as an impressive employee.  She runs the…,
27,So glad we stayed here,For our first visit to NYC| Hotel Giraffe proved to be the perfect place to stay.  Location is good| with neighbourhood safe and relatively quiet (as quiet as NYC can be).  Service was very good throughout the hotel and 4 night stay| indicating a well managed and consistent approach.  The evening wine and canapés was great and something we looked forward to. Again| the staff couldn’t do enough| even ensuring glasses were topped up before the service shut down!  Our King Suite was just right - comfortable and well appointed. Only downside was the construction work across the street| which did impact on sleep somewhat. Not really the hotel’s fault| but they were aware of it.  So| can’t give an Excellent rating this time - maybe next?,
35,Helpful Staff ,My sister and I visited for four nights in February 2019. As a smoker it was great to sign a no smoking agreement in the room| the reason for this is our room was a heavenly sleeping sanctuary. The room had robes| slippers| a turn down service at night. The beds were so comfortable. Plenty of pillows on the bed so we could pick which one we wanted. There was a balcony in the room which was lovely to look out at on the street but the best thing was the blackout blind which blocked out the noise. The staff at reception| breakfast| evening drinks were lovely. A special mention must go to the doormen who were courteous| professional and helpful. I had a broken thumb so was incapacited to an extent. They were amazing. We have recommended this hotel to all our friends in Ireland.…,
1,5/5 stars,Everything was perfect.  Great location.  Couldn’t be cleaner or more comfortable.  The best part was the staff.  Everyone was friendly and accommodating.  This is our new favorite place to stay in Manhattan!   An added bonus was the partner restaurant Bread and Tulips located right downstairs. They offer hotel guests 20 percent of their bill and food was absolutely delish!  My son recommends the four cheese pizza.,
53,Giraffe Hotel NYC,We stay at this wonderful boutique hotel in Murray Hill at least once a year.  The decor is wonderful| the amenities are great| but the team is the main reason we keep coming back.  This level of personal service and recognition is only available at a smaller hotel - and the accommodations are first class as well.  There's a complimentary continental breakfast as well as complimentary wine and snacks in the early evening.  This is a very civilized hotel - quiet| refined and a gem that we hope doesn't get too many amazing reviews or we won't be able to book when we want to come back!,
177,Smooths out rough parts of travel,We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Giraffe very much. For the money| this is the best value in the city based on my last 10 trips to NYC. Great access to restaurants (Blue Smoke| Sarabeth’s| Maialino| Black Barn)| and the inclusion of self-serve espresso and pastries/fruit throughout the day| in addition to complimentary breakfast and wine/cheese from 5-8pm make for a very comfortable pace in the city so you don’t have to constantly run around to different places to eat or grab coffee. The New York Sports Club is just down the street (free daily passes included) and the service was exceptional from hotel staff. Looking forward to more visits at Hotel Giraffe.,
32,Perfection,I spent a lot of time researching the perfect hotel at which to stay while celebrating my 40th birthday in NYC. I couldn't have possibly made a better choice than Hotel Giraffe. It was a quick| 24-hour stay for us. We only wish we could have stayed longer. I booked the seasonal special offered on their website which included complimentary hot chocolate and two Hotel Giraffe mugs to take home. However| because it was my birthday| they surprised us when we arrived to our room with a hand-written card| a bottle of Prosecco on ice and silver box containing 4 chocolates. Even though it was cold out| we still enjoyed having a room with a balcony. We loved the size of the room. Everything was clean and comfortable in our king suite. The king bed was very comfortable and my daughter…,
48,Oasis in the city,My seven friends and I have stayed at the Giraffe for the 3rd time in 5 years.  Each time we are greeted by friendly and professional staff - from the doormen to the front desk staff to those behind the scenes (Ray Shum) have made each visit special.  The rooms are spacious| well decorated and extremely clean.  The bathroom was well appointed and with a shower tub - offered an option to guests.   The common areas are filled with fresh flowers daily and the breakfast and Happy hours are sumptuous and Gabriella is an amazing hostess and server.  Her personality is warm and inviting and she adds to the overall ambiance of piano music and chatter.  If you have the opportunity to stay at this gem - do so - you will not be disappointed.,
1,Happy to return to family-friendly luxury.,The Giraffe is our family's favorite hotel in New York.  Not only is it a great value (suites easily fit our family of 4) but we feel truly at home during our stays here.  It's reassuring to meet the same staff over several visits.  Breakfasts and the evening wine and  cheese hours are relaxed and family-friendly.,
1,I’ll be back,This is a well-maintained| well-located hotel with a hotel staff that is attentive and very| very good. The breakfast was a good solid continental and the afternoon amenities were appreciated. And turn-down service was an extra treat.  I look forward to future visits. ,
38,Charming and highly recommend,This is the place if you want to be on the lower east side of NYC. Rooms are modern and well appointed. the staff is professional and attentive. Especially Gabriella during breakfast time or happy hour. The open lobby area is welcoming to hotel guests or guests of guests and has a felling of a salon that you might have at home. You find yourself chatting with strangers who are other guests and simply enjoying each other because the hotel is that comfortable. And it has style.,
1,Another wonderful stay,"Third stay at the Giraffe.   Great location| beautifully appointed rooms| helpful/knowledgeable staff at front desk and a fantastic/comfortable lounge with delicious food and drinks. All of this in a very ""non-stuffy"" atmosphere. (I am a small towner). Thanks so much to Gabrielle (per usual) and to Nicolas. Back soon. Your Canadian friends",
572,We Love the Giraffe!!,This is our second stay at this lovely little hotel. It’s perfectly located between midtown Manhattan and downtown. Hotel Giraffe 🦒 offers a continental breakfast and a complimentary wine and cheese 🧀 reception every evening. They also have a great rooftop garden!  The employees are super friendly| too!!,
27,Only Hotel We'll Ever Stay in when Visiting New York,"We recently stayed for the second time at the Hotel Giraffe and were delighted with every aspect of the hotel.  From the moment we arrived| well before the 3 p.m. check-in| when the desk person moved ""things"" around so that we could get to our room early| to the doorman wishing us a safe trip home when we exited the hotel| our visit could not have been nicer.  The pleasant room| the delicious breakfasts| the evening wine and cheese| the warm and inviting lobby |the excellent location| and most importantly the friendliness of every employee make this a very special place.",
1,Hate to leave,I love this hotel and it’s hard to leave come checkout time. The entire staff is excellent - from doormen to desk| to those serving breakfast and the wine reception| and housekeeping... Planning already,
2,Hotel Giraffe continues to impress,We spent four days and three nights in New York last week| and our stay at Hotel Giraffe could not have been nicer.  The rooms were immaculately cleaned and| unbelievably for New York| spacious.  Staff was accommodating| the little extras| like the cookies and pastries available| as well as the cheese and wine| really added a touch that guaranteed that we will be staying here every time we are in the city now on.,
4,Classy and comfortable,This was a perfect home base to explore lower and midtown Manhattan. Our king suite was roomy and the bed was superb. Heard zero noise from hall and other rooms. Decor is modern and in great condition. Staff is excellent. Nice continental breakfast in lounge with coffee to order. Super little hotel.,
7,Customer centric to the max,Hotel Giraffe is the closest thing to feeling like you are at home when in New York. The staff is terrific and they know how to take care of their guests. The continental breakfast and evening wine and cheese offerings are an appreciated benefit.,
12,Wonderful NYC Stay,Hotel Giraffe was a perfect place for a great visit to the city. Loved the location. The room was lovely - high ceilings| great beds and linens| bath robes| etc! Love the evening wine reception and the breakfast. ,
2,Always Completely Satisfied,The rooms are spacious| extremely clean and very stylish.  I have been staying here for the past 15 years and they still have a lot of the same staff.  I think that says a lot about a place when the employees enjoy their job and don’t want to leave.  Jose| the doorman| and Gabriella| the waitress in dining area| are both accommodating and truly set the tone of the Hotel Giraffe’s atmosphere.  So needless to say| staff is amazing.  Also| the amenities are incredible.  There are not many hotels in NY if any| where the breakfast is included and the wine and cheese hour is complimentary.  This hotel truly adds to any NY visit.,
1,Excellent Stay at Hotel Giraffe,Great location.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Nice complimentary breakfast and wine/cheese reception.  Rooms are large by New York City Standards.  Upscale hotel for adults and business people.  Close to Madison Square Park area which is my favorite neighborhood of NYC.  4 & 6 Subway nearby; QWR Subway is only a few blocks.  I walked from Penn Station but I don't recommend if you have a lot luggage or the weather is bad.,
2,Consistently excellent,Stayed here once again for 16 nights. Exactly as before. Very comfotable hotel in great location. Staff and service always great| efficient and friendly. This was our fourth visit and absolutely certain there will be a fifth.,
1,I love this hotel!,I adore Hotel Giraffe! This was my fifth stay and I wont stay anywhere else! There were 3 of us girls and we got the suite which was perfect! The den has a pull out bed-this room and the bedroom have a closet and bathroom in between so there is plenty of privacy.  The complimentary breakfast is wonderful-they have lattes as well as coffee| fruit and pastries.  The happy hour is so nice-free wine|cheese and crackers. A great spot to unwind after a busy day and before going out to dinner. The staff is the nicest-so helpful and pleasant and the staff has been the same since we started coming 5 years ago!  They even remembered us!  This hotel is by far the best deal in town! Highly recommend!,
4,Two day stay.,Very clean| wonderful service.  The free breakfast was just wonderful| and the woman who works the breakfast is to wonderful| you don't want to leave.  Everyone on staff is amazing.  Anything you need is done right away. ,
1,Overall fantastic experience,Everyone at the hotel treats you like family.  Rooms are inviting and clean. With your stay breakfast  includes custom coffees| fresh fruit and baked goods and warm| fresh boiled eggs and the evening hours offer complimentary wine and cheese| olives and crackers. Service is excellent.  Will definitely stay here on future visits.,
15,Fabulous Boutique Hotel in the heart of NYC,We keep coming back to this hotel for its well appointed rooms| great location| and its complimentary breakfast and late afternoon wine and cheese offerings. Having a great breakfast with fresh fruit| warm hard-boiled eggs| juice| bagels| muffins| scones| and more before venturing out for the day is just wonderful. And the espresso and latte machine is available all day long as well. After a full city day| coming back to the lovely lobby sitting area for wine and cheese makes for a lovely down time before a late dinner and an evening out. The staff is always solicitous and they all want to make your stay a special one. We will always continue to come back to this hotel. We've been in hotels elsewhere with larger rooms| but this room has plenty of drawers for storage| a very well…,
1,A perfect experience,Everything was wonderful. The staff are fantastic| the rooms are spacious and clean and the location was convenient. This hotel is a hidden treasure. The price for what you are getting is very reasonable. I will make certain it is my hotel of choice for my future trips to NYC.,
39,Back again,My favorite hotel in New York. Hotel Giraffe is my “home away from home”. For the minute you walk the staff is impeccable. Not only is breakfast included but fresh fruit| coffee (including cappuccino!) and pastries are included as well. Finally one can’t beat the location.,
20,Amazing hotel in a wonderful location,Loved our room... great size| reasonable price| very nice shower.  We even had a fridge in our room and housekeeping left us 2 waters every morning.  Can’t say enough about the complimentary 3 hour wine/cheese hour each night and complimentary breakfast each morning.  I would definitely stay here again when in New York.  Very convenient walking location or easy Uber ride to many main attractions,
5,Great Location and Hospitality,Loved continental breakfast offerings and the evening hospitality.  It was very welcoming and helped us meet other guests.  Your hostesses were lovely and made us feel most welcomed.  The beds and pillows were very comfortable.  We would stay with you again.  ,
55,A wonderful place to stay in New York,We had a one night layover between flights at the end of a fantastic holiday and decided we would head into Manhattan from JFK.  What a good decision that was!   Hotel Giraffe has a great location on Park Avenue South in the NoMad district of The City.  On our arrival Nick at reception was very attentive and helpful| as were all the staff we spoke to - at the complimentary| nightly wine and cheese reception| at the Bread & Tulips restaurant (we nearly didn't make because of all the wine and cheese) and the following morning at check out.  All the staff treated us like we were family at a house party| fantastic. The room we had was splendid with a very large and comfortable bed (one day I'll get to grips with the way Americans 'super-size' their bed measurements!) . There was a…,
25,Perfect weekend break,From the moment we arrived to the moment we departed the staff could have not been more attentive and helpful.  The room was perfectly appointed| very well maintained (unusual these days in chain hotels I find) and the little touches such as the turn down service really added some finesse.  The lounge was always comfortable and inviting with a loverly atmosphere not just during the complimentary breakfast and evening cheese & wine reception| but all day.  The attached Bread and Tulips restaurant was also excellent. We look forward to returning and would definitely highly recommend.,
65,Beautiful - will return,I was here on business and will return in the future. 4 days and could’ve stayed longer without being unhappy. There’s adequate space in the room| especially for NYC and the staff was very accommodating. The Italian restaurant downstairs was quite acceptable and pricing fair for NYC.,
47,Exceeded all expectations!,We travel to NYC a lot| but this is our new favorite hotel! We loved the size and boutique feel| and the attentive service. We are greeted at the valet by Ron| who expedited our check-in process despite it being quite busy when we arrived. This was a huge help to us| as we were running a bit late. Thank you Ron for that extra level of exceptional service! The location is excellent| close to everything. The hotel is quote nice| and the room was very spacious by all standards| and positively huge by NYC standards. The evening wine and cheese was a nice and very welcome touch. We highly recommend this hotel| and can't wait to return. Jeff & Kayla,
20,Great hotel & clean HVAC!,Comfortable beds| pillows & sheets. Large rooms| quiet| sleep sound machine next to bed. Favorite part... the HVAC did NOT make me congested & stuffy| I slept great! Included breakfast was decent and did the trick. Great location!,
1,My birthday!,What a way to celebrate!  Fine chocolate & champagne on ice in our room upon our arrival.  Very comfortable bed & well thought out room layout.  We have stayed here several times before & never been let down.  Great continental breakfast & daily wine & cheese spread lasting for 3 hours.layout.  Quiet room (requested).  Professional & gracious staff.,
7,Wonderful visit ,Clean big rooms| comfy bed| good noise isolation| and the staff is so helpful and nice. It’s a no brainer for me to go back there next time! Continental breakfast included| maybe a bit small for gluten intolerants/low carbs but you could also order and pay for a warm breakfast.   Thank you. ,
229,Perfect,Friends had recommended this hotel which we had never heard of and it was terrific in every way. The location is central and the building itself is stately. The folks at the front desk are extremely helpful. The room was quiet (we were on the ninth floor facing 26th Street) and large enough. The breakfast is plentiful and served in a light and airy part of the lobby. This hotel has won our hearts and will be our NYC go to from now on.,
1,Boutique Hotel in Mid Town New York,Staff were excellent and very efficient| a big thank you to Gabriela who’s smile lit up the lobby whenever we saw her. The location is good Mid town 2 blocks from the Flat Iron district and 15 mins to the Empire State Building. I would definitely book again.,
2,Great boutique hotel in Chelsea/Madison Square Park area,We love this hotel. It has a great location and is within easy walking distance of Flatiron/Chelsea/Madison Sq Park. Offers complimentary wine and hors d'oeuvres every evening as well as complimentary breakfast. The staff is excellent. ,
3,Mid-week Stay,Spacious room with luxurious amenities. Quality| complimentary breakfast with barista coffees. The only negative was the lack of an on-site gym but complimentary passes to a gym just three blocks away are available.,
1,Great value gem on Park Ave South,Small quite hotel with spacious cozy welcoming lobby great for meeting with a client. Very helpful friendly staff. Stayed in a King with Balcony. The room was very comfortable with great balcony to enjoy a glass of wine at the end of the day. Reasonably priced for this area of NYC. Only 20 to 30 minute cab ride from LAG airport. Next time I need to come to NYC for business will stay here again.,

Well appointed premises throughout - highly-trained and courteous staff. Never disappointed with our visit to NYC when we stay at the Hotel Giraffe. Highly recommend.,
31,my new favorite NY hotel,Loved this hotel and will stay here next time I'm in NYC for business or pleasure. Very attractive boutique hotel with nice accommodations. Rooms not huge| but certainly adequate and bathroom was spacious and modern. Loved the evening wine/cheese spread and the breakfast selection was very good. Nice staff too| especially the wine and breakfast lady. They also had a piano player for the evening. Definitely will be back when i can take full advantage! ,
1,Excellent boutique in NYC,Have made the Hotel Giraffe our goto Hotel in NYC. The staff is great| the breakfast is the perfect amount and the Cheese and Wine in the early evening is something we rush back to.  Strongly recommend the Hotel Giraffe t,
17,Get the King Suite -- perfect with kids! My very favorite NYC hotel to date.,"I come to the city approximately 3-4 times a year.  For perspective| I have stayed at the Chelsea Savoy| The Moxy Times Square| The Millennium Hotel Broadway| and Courtyard.  Of the aforementioned| The Millennium was my favorite for cleanliness and comfort| The Chelsea Savoy for location (I tend to love being AWAY from Times Square and situated in a Manhattan neighborhood).  But none of these compare to my overall WONDERFUL experience at Hotel Giraffe.   Booking was easy and I even got a special rate as it landed during ""Hotel Week.""  Actually| my dates ran one day outside of hotel week| but the special rate was honored anyway.  I was given an early check-in of 9:30 am (unheard of! But the room was ready) and the staff invited us to participate in weekend brunch in the lobby as…",
1,Our 1 night visit to NYC,J and I decided to take a trip to NYC for a show a few blocks away.  I found the Giraffe online| went with the reviews showing that it was a good hotel| in a good spot.  The location was great| the staff| very friendly| the vibe| very intimate.  The room was a good size by NYC standards.  Some nice touches| really can't say anything but good about the Giraffe and will be sure to come back.,
2,Perfect location| amazing staff and great rooms,My sister and I spent 2 weeks at the hotel last year (23 May to 6 June). It was our first time visiting New York (we are South African) and were pleasantly surprised by the location and quality of service at the hotel! Staff are wonderful| helpful and warm! Free wine and cheese evenings were a bonus  - special mention must be made of Gabriela| friendly and efficient  - in the 2 weeks we spent there I do not recall seeing her without a smile on her face! Location is perfect - we were able to walk to many of the landmark in NYC from the hotel and staff were always available to assist with directions and recommendations. We will have no hesitation in staying at Hotel Giraffe on our next visit to NYC!.,
16,Great Hotel made so by wonderful staff,Our 4 night end of December 2018  stay at the Hotel Giraffe was a delight.  Our room was comfortable and quiet. Included Breakfast and evening wine & cheese with piano player were great. The location convenient for dining| museums and other sightseeing.  But what puts the Giraffe several notches above the competition is the outstanding hotel staff.  They made our stay thoroughly enjoyable --- we cannot wait to return!,
106,Great location| clean and comfortable but... somewhere between average and very good.,Having looked at what felt like every hotel review on the web for every hotel in New York midtown| and trying to secure a good rate for a fabulous hotel| I settled on the Giraffe due to the group of library hotels being 1|2 and 3 in NYNY according to Tripadvisor. I had discounted The Nomad| The Surrey and No 1 Hotel among others due mainly to cost as they seemed to be materially no better than the Giraffe. I have given some thought to this review as I know from his review replies that the manager is very proud of his hotel and I didn’t want to be unfair| so my comments will be as objective as I can make them.  The Hotel Giraffe is clean| well positioned and well run. The doorman and staff polite and efficient. The beds very| very comfortable and the rooms both clean and well…,
22,Great Weekend Stay at Hotel Giraffe,This was our second stay at this property. There are several reasons that we went back. First| is there attentive service. From the moment we get there to our departure| the employees are super responsive. A special shout out goes to Gabriela. Second| are the enjoyable wine and cheese happy hour from 5-8 PM and the continental breakfast| both of which are better than other hotels that we stay at. Last is the location| away from the Midtown crowds| but close to many other venues in Manhattan.,
1,Excellent service,We particularly enjoyed the happy hour and free breakfast. The host| Gabriella| was excellent! Very welcoming| attentive service. Also| great location. We walked everywhere we wanted to go. Comfortable bed and room. ,
1,My favorite hotel in NYC,Hotel Giraffe feels like home. This was my fifth or sixth visit. Gabby is the absolute best and makes everyone feel like a friend. She runs the lounge in the lobby where guests have free continental breakfast and wine and cheese each evening. The service across the board is excellent| the rooms are spacious and spotless and the beds are super comfortable. Fantastic location as well. Our only minor complaint:  the coffee and tea in the lounge are not hot enough. If that is all you can complain about| that is a pretty awesome hotel.  ,
5,Consistently high quality,My friend and I spent the weekend at Hotrl Giraffe. It’s lkke coming home| if your home is a well-appointed| spotlessly clean hotel suite with turn down service| a wine and cheese reception each night| and a lovely breakfast each morning.  The staff is friendly and confident. You can tell they are proud to work in a great hotel and they should be. There’s no other place for me in NYC. We even had Prosecco and chocolates waiting for us. You won’t regret staying here.,
31,Brilliant,This hotel is hands down one of the best I have ever stayed in. When we arrived we had a little surprise in the room of prossecco| balloons and a congratulations card as we had recently been married. Nothing was too much for the staff who where dead friendly and helpful. Our toilet broke and they came and fixed it right away. The two girls who served breakfast where so polite and lovely as was the girl who done the cheese and wine. We also spent New Year in the restaurant and it was amazing. The staff were again super friendly and polite. The location was ideal. I would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat. ,
80,Wonderful European type hotel,We loved our stay at this hotel.  My son daughter with her daughter both stayed here.  The continental breakfast was great.  Also food and coffee  was available all day in the lobby.  I would definitely recommend this hotel for business or pleasure,
39,Everything was great,We really liked our king suite. It had 2 rooms and door separating the bedroom. Enough seating for our family of 4. The lobby was nice|  evening music with snacks and wine were great. All the staff very friendly. Bed was comfortable and lots of pillow choices. We’d be back in a heartbeat.,
7,Christmas in New York,A small but perfectly formed Hotel - we loved the location - easy to walk everywhere or close to subway when tired.  Our rooms very comfortable and the service was excellent.  Would definitely recommend.,
10,Worldwide my most favourite hotel,I've visited this hotel 5 times now and introduced 2 friends who also visit regularly. I love their people| the facilities| the breakfast| the wine and cheese every evening and the location is superb.  They clearly look after their staff as it's the same team there every year and they remember all returning guests even down to your coffee and bagel preference at breakfast.I will be a lifetime regular customer and there's not a single other business I could say that about,
5,Beautiful Hotel,My family and I stayed at this hotel for two weeks over the Christmas and New Year period and it lived up to its reputation on TripAdvisor.Everyone we met in the hotel went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed and we were treated like royalty by Gabriella. She made us all feel comfortable and took time to ensure our teenage daughters were looked after which was very much appreciated.The location is perfect and the rooms were excellent.Will return again,
1,Family Christmas Get Together,Been doing this ever since Giraffe opened. We won't go anywhere else. Seven rooms plus other friends had three rooms so you cn see we are sold on The Giraffe. Breakfast in the morning in the lobby is outstanding and wine and treats in the evening is perfect .  Later at night lobby is great for [laying games.Personnel in all areas is outstanding.,
1,Cass and Lina,We have been traveling to NYC for Christmas for the last several years and this is our best choice place to stay. It strikes the right balance of Location| size| friendly staff and price that we have found in the city. They treat us like family there.,
5,Perfect Stay,Loved this hotel| the morning breakfast was great for meeting to plan our day and after a busy day to come back to wine and cheese in the eveing was relaxing.  Evening hostess for the wine| Gabriella was delightful and made everyone feel welcome.  Will definitely return ,
6,Quality Hotel,We stayed for 6 nights and absolutely loved this hotel. We cannot speak highly enough of the staff but Gabrielle in particular is an absolute gem and credit to the hotel. It was a pleasure to speak with her at the evening reception.,
23,Stunning detail,Such a great boutique hotel king suite was sumptuous. Turn down service| the Works! Really like the cheese and wine. Nice touch. There is a reason why this is rated number 2 on trip advisor (at time of writing the review anyhow).,
112,Stay here.,I booked the Giraffe for 3 nights to explore New York. We loved it.  Located between 28th and 23rd street subway stations and walking distance to the Flat Iron and even Times Square and Empire State Tower (if you're fit enough).  Breakfast was included which consisted of continental type cofee| toast| bagel| pastry cereal boiled eggs etc.. not bacon pancake though we were happy with this having spent a week indulging on a cruise ship.  Coffee| tea| biscuits| pastries were available all day complimentary and at 5 until 8| quality cheese and wine again complimentary.   The hotel is boutique and the rooms were excellent very big comfortable bed| silent air conditioning and high enough not to hear the city bustle.  I would recomend the Giraffe to anyone.,
81,Good little all rounder,This is a great find| ideally placed in Midtown meaning the walking distances are equally ranged whichever direction you decide to stride out in.  The room was a great| comfortable bed and a powerful shower so I'm happy. Front desk staff were always friendly and helpful| plus the young lady who served breakfast was just lovely. They do a 'continental' breakfast which was fine for us| when we wanted something cooked they offer to help you out| but we just went elsewhere.  A big bonus is they do free wine and cheese! Every night! For 3 hours! Don't get me wrong| we only managed to get back for it once| but what a great little bonus.  I've already told 2 other people to stay here and I'd definitely stay here again. Top job.,
103,Excellent hotel,This was our first stay at this hotel.We stayed here for 5 nights over the New year period. Our check in was easy| staff were friendly and helpful.  Our room was a King suite on the 5th floor. There were 3 of us| me| my husband and our daughter aged 18 years old staying so the room was a perfect size for us.  The bed and pillows were really comfy. We had controllable heating/aircon so we were able to set the room temperature accordingly.  Turn down was done every evening and the sofa bed was made up daily.  Every evening between 5pm and 8pm there was a wine and cheese reception. We enjoyed this a couple of times and used this as a way to relax after a busy day walking around Manhattan. There was one lady in particular who staffed this event. She was very friendly and kept the…,
11,Understated elegance,This is our third stay and our most enjoyable mainly because the suite we were given far exceeded our expectations. You really get spacious| stylish accommodations at this property| fully supported by a strong| professional staff.,
2,Hidden Gem,This is the third time we have stayed there and have already made reservations for this coming  year.  Charming boutique that exceeds expectations.  The staff is friendly and helpful and we particularly enjoy the wine and cheese that is set out in the lobby at 5:00 for the tired and weary.,
4,Great hotel for business travel!,I recently stayed at the hotel on business and found it to be very nice.  I would highly recommend staying at this hotel if you have  to be in this part of the City on business.  The staff were extremely courteous and supportive and the rooms were very comfortable.,
35,What they say is true about this hotel,I was able to book a balcony King suite with my family of four (6 and 8 yr olds) over Christmas. The room was huge and plenty of storage space.  We were blown away by the simple| thoughtful| homey| comfortable| and personal service that we received at this boutique hotel. I am terrible with names but the the doormen (who fixed our clogged toilet twice!)| the helpful staff at breakfast (included) and during the wine and cheese receptions (included) all exemplified caring and excellent customer service. Very cliche| but this is a very honest review. When we ask for something| they actually and REALLY deliver. What a concept these days when we get an attitude at other hotel stays for the same price in this city.  The turn down service and room cleaning were all done even on the day…,
2,hotel stay,this hotel is great . the rooms are clean the staff is pleasant and they take care of everything . it is centrally located and is very convenient to all of the sights and restaurants .  i highly recommend it ,
1,Another Great Holiday Visit,It's so easy to relax into the Hotel Giraffe family.  Warm| welcoming| genuinely delighted to see return guests! We always stay here. Great location. Fantastic service.  Evening wine and cheese always a great.,
112,Another great stay,Gabriella was| once again| just the best!!  Location is perfect| in the middle of everything without being too close to the crowds. Excellent accommodations and extremely friendly and accommodating staff. ,
8,great stay in this charming place,Great location| reasonable price (for NYC)| spacious and comfortable room (including comfy bed)| large window/glass door onto small balcony allowing lots of natural light and really nice and helpful staff.,
2,Pleasant surprise!,My husband and I reserved the Giraffe for a romantic night in the city. We have stayed in many city hotels and when we walked in this room| we couldn’t believe how big it was! It was so spacious and nicely furnished. High ceilings| a balcony with French doors and every detail you could imagine. The staff was so accommodating and friendly. We didn’t go to the wine/ cheese reception but we walked through it and it looked awesome. We had tickets to a concert at msg| so we couldn’t stay. Walking distance to msg| maybe 15/20 minute walk. Plus| they have a 1pm checkout. That’s unheard of. We will definitely visit the Giraffe again!,
2,NYC Home Away From Home,"Boutique hotel| with all the amenities| and the exceptional staff| is beyond compare. The Giraffe is located in an area of NYC where you can take a morning walk| and actually say ""good morning"" to the people who live on the block. This was our 2nd stay| and we are already planning our 3rd.",
29,Best Staff in NYC,An outstanding hotel experience!  The Giraffe staff was friendly and very accommodating We were a family group traveling with a 1 year old in December. Our rooms were extremely  clean and provided all amenities needed. They were able to provide us with a Pack and Play and refrigerator in the baby’s room. Evening wine and breakfast were excellent.  The Hotel Giraffe has quickly become our new NYC favorite! We will definitely return on our next trip to the city.,
4,Favorite Hotel,The facility| the staff| the location| the service and care make The Giraffe our favorite hotel in NYC (and almost everywhere). The staff are friendly| efficient and highly competent and aim to please. Housekeeping is impecable and quick.,
113,Fairytale Boutique in NYC,Stayed here for 4 nights in the run up to Christmas. It was our first ever visit to New York and the Hotel Giraffe was a fantastic choice. The location near to the Flat Iron District and the Empire State Building was excellent; the room was large| immaculately clean and well-furnished; and| the staff was incredibly attentive and friendly. The complimentary cheese and wine in the lobby every evening with a piano player is a really cool touch. Definitely be booking for our next trip.,
1,162,Perfect stay,Excellent location| staff| cleanliness and all the amenities you would love to have.  Breakfast| coffee all day and wine and cheese and snacks from 5-8 daily.  What a great value.  The balcony king suite is a really nice large room.  If you plan to do a lot in Flatiron district this is a great place to stay and many parts of the city are easy to get too.  Probably our favorite place that we have stayed in NYC.
37,NYC Gem,The Giraffe never disappoints.  The rooms are clean| comfortable| and spacious (by NYC standards).  The location can't be beat - convenient to two main subway lines and within walking distance to  great restaurants and points of interest.  The staff| however| is what makes the Giraffe a true gem.  The front desk can assist with any requests| cabs miraculously appear| and the free continental breakfasts and nightly wine and cheese offerings are a true value-added.  We look forward to visiting with Gabriella| the thoughtful and charming hostess| on every visit.  ,
3,Memorable Stay in NYC,Hotel Giraffe is a perfect boutique hotel in a perfect little spot. The service is the real winner here. We arrived before our room was available and the staff were more than accommodating. Jose| the doorman| was fantastic. He bent over backwards to help us find places to eat| explore| transportation| and just a great person. A great experience before the Christmas holiday. Breakfast was simple but great as well.,
1,Perfect Location| Perfect Hotel,Stayed here last week for 5 nights in a Classic King Suite. Excellent room| plenty of space for two and quality fittings and furniture etcWe were told that the views from the hotel were limited and therefore we opted for a room without a balcony (which definitely wasn’t needed as we were out all day anyway!)Reception staff were very friendly and always happy to help.Located a 12 minute walk to the Empire State Building| and approximately 24 minutes walking distance to Times Square. Close enough to the action but far away enough to get a peaceful nights sleep.Will definitely be planning another trip back to New York and would not hesitate to stay here again.,
7,BEST IN THEIR CLASS!!,This is the nr 1 choise for us. We have stayed in many hotels thrue the years and this hotel is| in our opinione the best choice. They are not trying to be 5 stars and they are never going to touch the 3 star aeria. BEST IN THEYR CLASS!,
7,Fantastic Hotel!,Definitely will return here ~ Hotel is fabulous with wonderful amenities! Continental breakfast and cookies| tea and coffee in the afternoon| wine and cheese available in the evening before dinner ~ simply home away from home. Staff served humbly and perfectly kind ~ Not one complaint...,
2,Always look forward to staying at the Giraffe,Staying at the Giraffe is like staying being at a home away from  home. From the moment we step through the doors we are greeted with a warm “welcome back” from all the wonderful people we have gotten to know over the years. Everything about this hotel is spot on| so much so other hotels could take a lesson on how to treat guests and make there stay  the best it could possibly be in all ways. Thank You all and a very Merry Christmas and the best in the New Year. See you on our return visit.,
34,Average experience - poor breakfast!,"I have visited in NYC about 10 times in the past year and this time selected the Giraffe hotel based on the reviews in Trip Advisor.Overall experience was average. I was not able to see ""amazing service"" during the check-in/out| nor anywhere else during my stay. The breakfast was exactly the same every day - very generic and basic. They are just servicing that at the hotel lobby so there is no any restaurant at the hotel.The room was ok but VERY noisy. There was no any soundproofing and all traffic noise is coming directly to the room. WC was very cold.I would recommend to select some other hotel with the same money as I don´t see that the there is enough value for your money. I don´t really understand why this hotel is so highly rated in TripAdvisor - at least some of ratings…",
4,Friendly staff,Always a pleasant stay.  The staff is consistently helpful and friendly.The free access to a quality fitness center is a plus.  However| the nearby fitness center is getting a bit run down and needs refurbishing.Nice to have food| drinks| snacks available through the day.,
1,Wonderful Stay,Hotel Giraffe was absolutely superb. It was exactly as advertised on the website. Perfect location| not too busy but within a few minutes walk of the sites. Staff could not have been more helpful. Brilliant ,
6,Amazing hotel| amazing staff,The room we had was stunning. A wee suite. Exceptionally comfortable. We loved the breakfasts and the evening cheese and wine tasting.  The prosecco was really delicious. I have to say| Gabriella is such a wonderful lady.  She made us feel so welcome and she is a huge shining star for you to have on your team.  Please pass on our huge thanks to Gabriella as well as everyone else who looked after us.  We really hope to be back again soon.,
12,Absolutely wonderful!,Living in Western Australia and travelling so far to get to New York| we wanted our hotel to be great - and it is! We’re staying 11 nights and arrived a couple of days ago and the staff here have been so welcoming| it really feels like home. We are a family of 3 travelling with our teenage daughter and so opted for the two double bed room with a balcony - perfect for us. Very clean and smelt lovely on arrival. Super comfortable beds and linen. The housekeeping lady did a great job yesterday - very friendly and courteous. The pre dinner wine/ cheese served in the lobby has a very relaxing feel and is just the ticket after a long day sightseeing. We’re so happy to have found this hotel and can’t thank them enough for their wonderful hospitality! 5 stars well deserved!!,
35,Absolutely loved Hotel Giraffe,We have just returned from 4 nights at Hotel Giraffe and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is spotlessly clean| all staff friendly and fantastic| bedrooms very comfortable and when we requested an extra blanket and kettle| nothing was any bother and the room maids done an amazing job.  Breakfast was tasty and the service in the morning was efficient.  The best part of our stay was the complimentary cheese and wine every night. It was just so relaxing to sit next to the piano and discuss our day with getting endless top ups of wine. however| what made this more enjoyable was Gabriella. Her laugh was infectious and she is a real credit to the hotel| such a pleasant host| we looked forward to chatting to her every night.  I can't recommend this hotel enough and when we return…,
241,Amazing service!,"I had stayed at the sister hotel (The Library)| and when they didn't have availability| I decided to try this one. It was a very good experience!  First the good!  From the moment we arrived| the service was impeccable! The people at the front desk were kind| knowledgeable| and very pleasant. The afternoon wine and cheese is what I love most.  It's obvious they want their guests to enjoy this time at the hotel| and it is especially welcoming after a day of ""crazy activity"" (e.g. tourism| shopping| working).    The not so good... Our room was immaculate.  The only reason I gave a four star was because one day we arrived past 2:00| and our room hadn't been made. I asked the lady to come and make it| but after waiting for over an hour| she came when I got in the shower.  After…",
38,Repeat visitors warmly treated like family.,"We enjoyed a return stay at the Hotel Giraffe| this time in a King Suite on the 12th floor. As ever| the room and hotel is kept immaculately clean and the staff remembered us -  and our drinks preferences - from a visit more than 6 months ago. That's exemplary and typical of what to expect at this fine property.  The lovely lobby hostess Gabriella will treat you well during the complimentary wine and cheese service from 5-8pm daily. The free breakfast is also consistently good and well stocked in the morning. As I've said before| this is hotel that provides top notch service and you know it's sincere and heartfelt when they say ""Welcome Back"".  Looking forward to a return visit in the new year.",
2,Mixed feelings,Interesting location.  Staff lovely. Really enjoyed lovely breakfast and cheese/wine in eve.   For the $—i would stay elsewhere| but thats my taste. Good for moderate ($)stay. Families—too much mixed crowd for me.  Rooms are ok.  Not overly large.  Closet smelled a bit musty-left doors open during stay. Bathroom great counter for all make up and second persons items Again- staff helpful in any manner u need,
1,Weekend getaway,Perfectly understated and warm with all our needs met. Great location for seeing nyc and a quiet street for sleeping. The entire staff was lovely and helpful with everything. Will be returning sometime next year for sure. Thanks again. ,
5,7th Visit of the year,Consistently top rate: friendly staff and wonderful continental breakfast. The 28th street east side subway stop is closed for renovation| so to use that line| you have to walk one extra block down to 23rd street. The west side subway is five blocks away on the other side of Madison Square Park.,
310,Anniversary trip was outstanding ,I’ve stayed in many hotels all over NYC and Hotel Giraffe was just superb in all aspects. Upon arrival the front desk staff was attentive and friendly come to find we were upgraded for our stay.   The room was well appointed and bed very comfy. Lots of windows too. Bathroom nice and roomy.   We were surprised with cupcakes| balloons and a bottle of red wine for our anniversary which was a complete surprise.   The hotel offers for free morning continental breakfast and an evening cheese and wine for their guests which adds to the hospitality of Giraffe hotel. ,
1,NYC,Quaint boutique hotel| with evening wine and cheese| breakfast daily.  Centrally located in the city.  Friendly Staff| look forward to coming back. Important to know that they do not take cancellations.  ,
10,Holiday Week at the Giraffe,My family and I stayed at The Giraffe for the week of Thanksgiving and had a great time. From the moment we checked in and met the people at the front desk who are friendly and welcoming to all the other staff people| we knew we were in good hands. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast every morning and loved the evening hours for a Prosecco and other delights.  Our rooms were wonderful too.,
1,Loved the Giraffe!,I stayed at the Giraffe with a group of girlfriends while we were in NYC earlier this month.  Everything about it was great!  The service and staff were fantastic.  We frequented the lobby lounge for breakfast and the evening wine reception.  It was so nice having access to tea/coffee| etc. throughout the day| especially since it was cold and snowy out.  The room was well appointed| quiet| clean and cozy.  Location very convenient.  Overall - a great trip and we'd stay there again!,
5,Another Fantastic Stay,We have stayed at the Giraffe numerous times and each stay has been wonderful.  The staff and the amenities (breakfast and happy hour) are really great.  Also| the rooms are very clean and well appointed.  We are looking forward to our return trip in January. ,
375,A superb hotel in NOMAD,"My wife and I stayed for four days in November. Excellent greeting| and we were upgraded| without request| to a king suite| on the 10th floor. Staff was uniformly nice. Breakfast| in the lobby| was buffet| and very good. Everything in the room worked. Excellent linens and towels. This is a relatively quiet hotel (which we love)| so if you're looking for a loud| bustling LES or Brooklyn vibe| this isn't it. Good restaurants nearby. Taxis readily available. The Giraffe is now our ""go to"" hotel in NYC.",
2,Return guest,After many visits| Hotel Giraffe continues to be our favorite spot in NYC. Great location. The small hotel feels very welcoming and intimate in a coty that can sometimes be large and overwhelming. Highly recommend ,
25,Hospitable and Quiet Small Hotel,From the moment we arrived the staff were professional whether it was the front desk| the doorman or the restaurant wit people.  The extra amenities of a lovely breakfast and a great cocktail hour only added to the experience. We have a lot of family in NYC and go there often and this hotel will be our go to place until our children have condos big enough for us.  The size of the king suite was wonderful with two separate rooms where you can close a door in between if you want extra quiet from a TV or someone on the phone.,
1,Perfect,This hotel lives up to the reviews on Trip Advisor.Staff are fantastic. Cheese and wine is such a great idea.Location is perfect - walking distance to all the sights and great neighbourhoods such as Greenwich.We found the window glazing to be slightly sub-par - it was a bit cold and noisy at night| but this is really a minor comment!We'd happily return next time we're in NYC.,
1,Mum and Daughter Trip to NYC,My teenage daughter and I traveled from Australia in November 2018 for a post High School Graduation trip for my daughter. We chose a Balcony Suite overlooking Park Avenue and the room was excellent - spacious| lots of storage| comfortable bed and Sofa bed and generous bathroom. The location was great - very proximate to Subway options| restaurants and Madison Square Park. The staff were amazing  - faultlessly helpful| professional and friendly. The daily complimentary breakfast and Wine and Cheese Reception was wonderful -  very generous and staff were exceptional.  We have stayed at the Giraffe Hotel 3 times now and we have never been disappointed. We will not hesitate to return.  The Library Collection Hotel owners have identified what travelers want and deliver it well.,
4,THE best place to stay in NYC,Best rooms and the best service in New York City!  The rooms are large and comfortable.  Don't miss the wine and cheese reception each evening.  I have never been disappointed with my stay at the Hotel Giraffe.,
10,Would be 5 stars but for the noise,Very nice hotel in a convenient location to get around (though the local subway was closed on our visit). The lobby area is a relaxing place to have breakfast with bagels| fruit| cereals etc to set you up for the day. It also makes a great start to your evening when cheese and wine is available and attentively topped up by the lovely Gabriella. The only thing that it down was the noise of the building site opposite with construction vehicles and skips being loaded with rubble at all hours. The one night they didn’t seem to be working (due to snow) we had beeping horns from New York drivers from 5am instead! We didn’t get a decent night’s sleep in the 3 nights we were there.,
1,Giraffe makes new high !!,Courtesy abounds. Staff great. Shout out to Gabby— the wine hostess at night. Great smile—always says “ welcome back”— nice to see. Overall another great stay !!It is rare -especially in NYC-to getbthis kind of personal attention. Giraffe is only hotel I will stay in. Just sayin’ !!!,
5,NYC only if Giraffe is available!,"Hands down my favorite NYC hotel!  Immaculate| friendly and efficient staff| within walking distance to everything I need and completely unpretentious.Breakfast and ""wine time"" are an added value.  What's not to love? ",
2,Great Hotel / Excellent Staff,This is one of the best hotels in NYC. The staff is warm and incredibly helpful no matter what you need done. The location is convenient to shopping| great restaurants and the subway. This is one of my favorite places to stay. On a nice day| the rooftop is open and you can see the city lights.,
44,Great location and very clean boutique hotel,Great value for NYC| including the free breakfast and the wine and cheese social hour.  My room was very spacious and clean| the wifi worked very well and my bathroom was very large for the space.  Soundproofing could use some refinements as you could constantly hear people's doors opening and closing.  Location is great.,
3,New York City November visit.,Once again our stay at the Hotel Giraffe was wonderful. Excellent service| and beautiful accommodations.We used the valet service this trip| and it was right on time| of course. We have been to many fine hotels in the city| but none can compare to the Giraffe.,
9,Great location| clean| friendly staff| free breakfast,Love this hotel! Close to Penn Station| subway| nice area| staff very friendly and helpful with directions. Free continental breakfast and evening wine and cheese. Room was very clean and a lot of space for NYC hotel room. Our room had a balcony. Construction going on next door and they started early but we were up early anyway. So far my favorite place to stay in NYC. We were visiting schools in area and downtown and easy to walk or take subway. ,
1,Great boutique hotel,Hotel Giraffe is a wonderful hotel. My favorite place to stay in New York. The staff is helpful and friendly. The lobby is welcoming and has a nice area to sit with friends| have a snack| cup of coffee or a glass of wine. Very nice breakfast which is included. The rooms a well appointed| clean and comfortable. I appreciate having places to unpack my clothes. I would highly recommend this hotel.,
1,Fabulous stay at the Hotel Giraffe,I recently spent five wonderful nights at the Hotel Giraffe with my two teenage children. It was our first trip to New York| we had an amazing holiday and the choice of hotel was perfect.  The location is great| close to the subway and very central for walking as well.  There is a good selection of restaurants near the hotel| including Bread & Tulips| ideal if you don’t want to leave the hotel as the lift takes you right down to the restaurant| Sarabeths where we enjoyed a really good brunch on our last day and Eataly| an Italian food emporium. Our ensuite bedroom was very spacious| plenty of room for the three of us| clean| extremely comfortable| well-equipped| the double bed was huge| and it was also very quiet.  Upon arrival the personnel had left a surprise bottle of…,
14,First rate,Lovely hotel. Conveniently situated. Room a good size for central NYC. Breakfast was very good and evening happy hour a pleasure. Great service at both and from front desk staff. Clean and well maintained throughout. Would recommend and would use again without hesitation.,
5,Another Superb Library Hotel,My Wife and myself stayed at the Giraffe for two nights on 26th and 27th of October 2018 after our Airline cancelled our Flights Home. This like its Sister Hotel the Casablanca was Excellent. The Staff were brilliant with you only having to ask the Staff and they were there to help. The Room was very comfortable with an excellent Breakfast and Cheese and Wine in the Evening. The young Girl Gabriella with her cheeky sense of humour was a delight and is a great asset to the Hotel. I would certainly recommend this Hotel without hesitation to anyone going to the Big Apple!!,
5,Great spot to stay in mid or lower Manhattan,We enjoy this hotel.  It is comfortable and well appointed and the rooms are nice and quiet. They offer a complimentary continental breakfast and it is across the street from a great restaurant called Upland.,
40,I have been here about a dozen times. It doesn't let you down.,This is a near perfect hotel| unbelievable value for the location.  The only minor issue this trip was the local 6 line station was closed for repair so we had to walk a little further.  Service here is impeccable. The rooms are a tiny bit tired but clean and super-comfortable.  I love this hotel.,
1,Excellent stay. Recommended!,I had a fabulous stay at Hotel Giraffe with my husband and two daughters. Our room was spotless and well appointed. What really made our stay was that everyone was unfailingly friendly| welcoming and helpful| and Gabriella| who kept us topped up with cheese and Prosecco every evening.I definitely recommend and look forward to staying again.,
1,Great Hotel| lovely staff| would recommend!,We recently stayed at Hotel Giraffe for our Honeybook and had the best time here! The location is perfect for quick access to metro for 10 minute journey to Times Square or 10 minutes south to lower Manhattan. The breakfast is great with a selection on bagels| fruits| cereal| pastries also with great coffee. The free coffee is also available all day which is handy if jet lagged!! The free wine and cheese is also brilliant and give a nice selection each night. All the staff are lovely and will help answer any of your questions.,
1,I'll be back!,I absolutely loved staying at the Hotel Giraffe! The room was outstanding| luxurious and clean| loved the balcony. The weather was fairly warm so I was able to have the doors open. The staff was professional| helpful and friendly. My daughter needed some emergency feminine products and the front desk provided. The location was great. I appreciated the continental breakfast provided and the wine and cheese in the evening. My only suggestion would be to put a coffee pot in each room rather than having to request| they were all out when I asked.,
2,Exceeded My Expectations,I hadn't been in NYC in 20 years and frankly expected inferior accommodations at an inflated price. I was very pleasantly surprised to find the Hotel Giraffe was excellent in every aspect - clean and good-sized room| nice amenities (breakfast and happy hour)| extremely friendly and helpful staff. Just an overall great experience.,
1,Great hotel!,We thought the rooms were very well designed. They were not large| but we had everything we needed. Clean| lots of storage (big closets| lots of drawers| counter space in bathrooms - these are not common!). The neighborhood is wonderful - many restaurants| bars| clubs| shopping. We were in town for a wedding| stayed three nights| very convenient.,
4,Wonderful family break!,We spent 5 nights here and we were thrilled with our choice of hotel. All of the staff were friendly and helpful| our rooms were spotless and comfortable and the Cheese and Wine Reception was an added bonus. The hotel is brilliantly located for accessing all the sights of New York either  on foot or by subway and there are some really nice restaurants close by. We had an amazing first visit to New York which was made all the more successful by our choice of this hotel!,
1,119,Another Excellent stay!,Whenever I am in New York I stay at this hotel and for all the good reasons: First| the service: it’s friendly| professional and mostly attentive! As a returning guest some of the staff member recognize my face and were even more welcoming! This is always a great feeling! Second| the hotel is well located | within walking distance from subway stations on the east and west side of the city. The room was spacious and kept very clean ( with evening turndown). And on top of all the great breakfast buffet and the “wine and cheese” every evening. All in all| simply excellent!
7,Great hotel in great location,Great hotel. One of the few that can accommodate a family of three or four at a reasonable rate. Complimentary breakfast and wine hour(s) included in rate. Very good service| convenient to both Midtown and lower Manhattan. ,
40,Great Staff,On the strength of your staff  my wife and I give you the top score. We did not meet anyone who wasn't pleasant| helpful and professional. My only wish is that your morning breakfast fare included more protein and fewer carbohydrates. As a diabetic I had to eat elsewhere. ×,
19,Girls getaway,This is my second time staying at the Hotel Giraffe and it was as outstanding if not better than the first. The customer service is what sets them apart. From the bellman upon arrival through check they were all so gracious. The complimentary breakfast and happy hour team greet you with such smiles and hospitality it is fantastic.,
2,Great location| great boutique hotel,Why stay in Times Square.  This location (near Flatiron) is perfect for getting uptown| downtown etc and  it's a great neighborhood with Madison Park and plenty of places to eat.   The staff here does everything to make your stay comfortable. The rooms are big and modern and morning breakfast and evening wine and cheese make this a homey stay.   My favorite place to stay in the city.   ,
1,An Excellent Place to Stay,Great lobby and amenities| and comfortable environment.   The all-day coffee and cookies| and afternoon wine and cheese was a wonderful extra. The staff was very helpful with any questions we had and in giving us suggestions and directions.,
1,Great stay in NYC,Excellent overall stay in lower manhattan. Wonderful breakfast to start your day in the big apple! Food service was great| very professional.Wonderful| helpful staff | and a very good value. Very large room | and perfect location.,
13,Boutique Hotel in New York,My wife and I stayed at this lovely boutique hotel| largely influenced by the positive reviews on Trip Advisor.  We were extremely pleased with our experience in several different areas.  First| the room was of ample size and featured numerous amenities| including an array of coffees and teas in the room and a small but usable balcony.  As many have commented on in their reviews| two things that set this hotel apart from so many of the chain hotels is the fact that they provide a wonderful continental breakfast each morning and a wine and cheese offering between 5-8 PM each evening.  Additionally| from 6-8 PM there was a piano player providing background music.  Again| what is so nice is that the hotel never felt crowded and it was a much more sane experience than that in some…,
18,Amazing,This place has the comfiest beds in the world. It is also really well placed|clean nice and does good breakfast. You can go to so many places from here. A really good addition is the restaurant which you can eat dinner at. ,
234,A very pleasant stay at this boutique hotel,We were in NY with a group tour and stayed at the Giraffe. Superbly located| the rooms are clean and well appointed. The silver lining is the complimentary breakfast| the complimentary all day refreshments and the evening cheese and wine. All rooms are executive rooms. The staff are amazing. Thanks to the excellent Gabriella.,
1,Perfect Stay,We spent 4 nights at this wonderful hotel.  The staff were all lovely| they really looked after us and made us feel very welcome. The trip was planned to celebrate our son's 21st birthday and they had kindly put a bottle of fizz and a card in the room.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was great. After being very busy during the day it was great to come back to a very warm welcome and the complementary cheese and wine.  The hotel is in a great location.  Do try the restaurant within the hotel.  Again the staff are lovely and the food was excellent. We will definitely stay at this hotel again.,
14,as usual,Staff exceptional; roons cleans; wonderful city; happy hour wiyh wines| piano and food; excellent breakfast; What else I will desire from a hotel?Oh| the weather was cold! But It is not a hotel problem...,
13,Great base to explore Manhattan,Very comfortable rooms & good breakfast. Complementary cheese & wine early evening is a lovely before heading off for dinner. Staff couldn’t be nicer or more helpful. Located close to a subway and walking distance to restaurants and sights. ,
10,Recomended,I was 3 days and i liked very much.Fantastic view.confortable bads and everything was very good. Nice servic at room and the restaurant was great. Good food and nice and friendly staff. I recomend this place,
54,Lovely Hotel,Yes| Hotel Giraffe is expensive. But you get great service| beautiful rooms| and a good location in return. The excellent lobby breakfasts and cocktail hour are managed with great flair by Gaby. Even your fellow guests are pleasant to be around| as they all seem to be having a good time at the hotel.,
1,Amazing Stay,The Giraffe Hotel is 1 word Amazing! Had my uncle Edwin & Aunt Nelly come from San Juan Puerto Rico on Vacation to relieve some of there stress do to huracán Maria impacted there lives in a very hard way. No electricity for months| no running water for months and lots of damage to there home. I promised him that I would show him a good time here in Manhattan and what better place than The Giraffe Hotel to enjoy clean| safe| top of the line environment. Thankyou soo much,
1,Wonderful Hotel,First time in New York City.  The Hotel was perfectly located| close to multiple subway lines and restaurants.  The hotel had friendly staff| lovely rooms| and I enjoyed both the Continental  breakfast| and Wine & Cheese.  It was a great home base for touring around the city.,
7,Excellent location| property| and staff,We have stayed ar this property three times while vacationing in NYC. ALways have been very happy with our decision. The free WlFi| and the daily free wine and cheese happy hour| and free 24 hour coffee all add to the experience. The rooms are very large and clean.,
2,Clean boutique hotel,Great and friendly service. Enjoyed wine| cheese and crackers along with continental breakfast . Each room has a sitting area and bedroom. Dinner was delicious at pane and tulipano . Suggest pizza | pasta and salmon. ,
5,Great hotel in a great location.,This gem of a hotel offered everything we could have wished for.  Staff were friendly and accommodating and the rooms were exceptionally clean.  I loved the plants in the room.  This hotel made us  feel at home amidst the hustle and bustle of Life in NYC.  Maybe it is the coffee| hot drinks  and pastries that await you when you get back to the hotel and the cheese and biscuits and wine that is on offer in the afternoons.  The lobby is cozy enough to feel as though you are in your own home.  If you are looking for a stunning place to stay in NY look no further.,
1,487,Our NY Home,The Giraffe never disappoints and continues to be our NY home. I have run out of superlatives to describe the excellence of the hotel and the exceptional staff| including Gabrielle| Ana| Manny| Juan and our weather vane| Jose| and of course Ray. The location is perfect with easy walk to Union Square and even to the theater district. The included continental breakfast offers an array of choices and the evening cocktails include appetizers and wine. I recommend booking early as it is often sold out! 
1,consistently fantastic boutique hotel,We have stayed at this hotel twice now| as well as a sister property (the Elysee).  The hotel is a lovely boutique hotel.  We booked a king suite and were upgraded to a balcony room when we checked in.  The room is spacious by New York standards and well appointed.  The juliette balcony was a nice surprise.  One of the highlights of this hotel is the consistently fantastic service.  We love the included breakfast| but especially the afternoon complimentary wine and nibbles and we always look forward to it at the end of a long day.  Gabriela (who served at breakfast and the wine & cheese afternoon event) is one of the best hostesses I've ever encountered.  She remembered my friend and me from a visit two years prior| which I think says something about her excellent…,
8,3 nice days in NYC,Rooms are very large compared to other NYC hotels. Breakfast is adequate| in terms of offerings| service is excellent. From a suggestion standpoint we found the room lighting to be below the level required for reading. Higher wattage bulbs might help. That said| this hotel is first rate| location is excellent| and service superb. We have| and will continue to recommend this facility over any other in NYC| and would not even consider searching for a better hotel experience.,
286,Boutique Hotel in great location,Despite a couple bumps| we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. We were told check in would be at 3 but our room wasn't ready until 5 which was frustrating.  The hotel staff did apologize and offered us a bottle of wine to compensate. Then after our first night in the king suite with balcony| I woke up to realize there was no Keurig or coffee maker in the room.  I found a note that you can call and ask for one but this annoyed me. Nearly every hotel offers them in every room and for this price I shouldn't have to ask/wait for one to be delivered.  However| I soon got my Keurig and the rest of the stay was great.  Service is excellent and there is a free breakfast and cocktail hour each day.  Also there are cookies and drinks available in the lobby 24/7.  The hotel is in a good|…,
7,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at,It has been almost 6 months since my last visit| and when I arrived Jose the doorman remembered me and greeted me like an old friend.  The breakfasts and evening wine and cheese host Gabriella is one of the most special people there.  She is so friendly and gives the hotel a bit of European elegance.  I cannot say enough| this is my choice for staying in NYC.,
2,Far from the madding crowd,Lovely boutique hotel on Park Avenue South without the chaos that reigns further North in Manhattan.  The Hotel caters for all of the experienced traveller's needs with subtle touches around the room that make being away from home that little more enjoyable.  Staff throughout the hotel are pleasant and in particular those serving breakfast who are supremely helpful every morning and not just the first.  We will most certainly stay at this hotel on our next visit and we recommend others follow suit.      ,
86,A little gem,It was our first time in New York and we wanted a smaller more personal hotel in midtown. We weren’t disappointed. We found the hotel welcoming nothing was too much trouble. We arrived very early as we came off a cruise ship. They offered us breakfast| stored our luggage and we were able to go off and have our first adventures. On tap coffee fruit and biscuits are a nice touch as our previous experience in the previous part of our tour had been that hotels don’t serve coffee. The wine and cheese was a bonus. Room was good and spacious enough for us. All the usual amenities. Only downside for us was the noise from outside on the Saturday night but as we live on the coast in a tiny village we’re not used to it. This hotel has the personal service of a family hotel but without…,
1,Beautiful hotel,This hotel is a gem. The staff is gracious and accommodating. The rooms are great - the beds are comfy|  room is clean and very stylish. Not your typical NYC hotel. I would definitely recommend staying here!!!,
5,Outstanding First NY Trip,Staying at the Giraffe added to an amazing first ever trip to NY.  Staff was incredibly welcoming| attentive and helpful.  Every detail taken care of.  Breakfast and Wine/Cheese great bonus and helped make daily planning easy.  Room was really nice!  ,
6,Amazing Hotel Experience,I cannot remember a friendlier hotel staff...very welcoming| attentive and courteous.  Everything was excellent...reasonable price| clean rooms| reasonable valet parking| excellent location.  Although my wife and I only stayed one night| it was definitely one of our all-time favorite hotel visits.,
6,Best Boutique Hotel,The staff always make you feel special and go the extra mile to ensure you have a great stay. We stay here whenever we’re in the city which is around once a month. The rooms are very comfortable and always super clean. It is located in Flatiron and very convenient to everything. We love the wine and cheese in the evening and the continental breakfast. This is one of the best places to stay in the city!,
22,Great hotel!,We stayed at the Hotel Giraffe last weekend because we were in NYC for the Eric Clapton concert.  The hotel is very nice and our room had a balcony on the corner of Park Avenue and 26th Street.  I chose the hotel because it was highly recommended by a friend.  Breakfast was included as well as happy hour wine and snacks so it made the price more reasonable.  It was a 15 minute walk to Madison Square Garden (which was lovely on an 80 degree October evening).  The staff was very pleasant.  The room was very nice and clean and modern.  I would definitely stay there again and highly recommend.,
1,Perfect weekend stay,Great location in the city.   Superb staff   The breakfast and wine happy hour were really special  the staff remembered how I like my coffee and brought it over to me when I arrived.   The rooms are quite and nicely appointed. The bed was really comfortable  ,
37,Solid Choice,Good location for lower and midtown.  Staff upgraded my room due to noise on lower floor.  Very appreciative.  Had to subtract a point for room cleanliness.  Check in was fast and professional.  An overall good choice for the area.  ,
1,Inadequately,Room could have been cleaner| furniture very stained| large table in front of couch| unusable | tv’s not connected correctly| horrible breakfast choices and food from one rest that would deliver would only bring one cup of coffee not pot of coffee. The mailed would leave glasses in bathroom that were not mine perhaps they were using them for their beverages.  Overall very inadequate on all levels.  ,
1,Hidden gem,Very quaint boutique hotel ... whose employees all went above and beyond . Fantastic customer service . Lovely hotel . We slept so soundly even with the noise of the city below . Don’t miss this hotel ! ,
22,Very nice hotel in good location,Nice hotel in a good location. The room was spacious. All the staff were very friendly and helpful and the service excellent. The breakfast service was lovely and has everything you need (unless you crave fried food). The wine and cheese from 5-8pm was a lovely idea and very much appreciated with live piano music as well| very relaxing. The only minor complaint was that the balcony windows could have been better insulated so there was a fair bit or traffic noise/horns/sirens etc. from outside. To be fair to the hotel| New York is a very busy and noisy city and they do offer headphones or ear plugs if desired. The air-con was nice and quiet though and worked very well. All in all I would recommend this hotel absolutely.,
42,Lives up to the reviews,We stayed for New Years Eve and beyond due to NYC being snowed in but what a great city and hotel to be stuck in. Location is great| it’s a lovely area with easy access to landmarks| Empire State 10mins| Grand Central 15mins etc. The staff are so welcoming and accommodating. We will be going back.,
28,Great boutique hotel in NYC,Just had a great 3 days in the city. I loved this hotel. Super quiet| clean and great resting spot between activities. 24/7 coffee tea and snacks in the lobby. Along with a nightly happy hour with cheese and wine. Book the balcony room if you want to really take in the sounds of the city!,
69,Great Stay,We spent 4 nights at the Giraffe hotel as part of our Golden Wedding celebrations.The reception staff were friendly| efficient and gave us lots information about the hotel.When we got to our room the staff had left a bootle of Prosseco and chocolates and a lovely message from the hotel staff.The breakfast was an added bonus and perfectly adequate to set you up for a day discovering New York.The cheese and wine provided each evening between 5pm and 8pm was a great success for us and Gabriella was a great server.Our room was not huge but perfectly adequate|however the lighting in the was not great and would suggest the hotel looks into this area. The only other thing we mention is that we thought the bath towels were on the small side and we are not the largest people in the…,
4,Respite in NYC,We stayed here for just one night. This was our second visit and it was a wonderful quiet stay in the middle of the bustling NYC. The cocktail hour and morning breakfast were perfect. Great ways to begin and end the day. ,
5,Excellence,Excellent hotel with excellent service and availability of food for breakfast and something all day long.  Location is also very good for restaurants.  Wine and cheese available at night.  Individuals who work at food service| the door and desk are all excellent.,
1,Great hotel and Customer Service! They went above and beyond...,A memorable stay! Customer service top notch| clean| nice quick breakfast to grab and go in the morning and nice complimentary cheese and wine in evening. Perfecto!  Additionally| they really went above and beyond !,
12,Great stay in NYC,We stayed at the Giraffe for 5 nights celebrating our anniversary and had a great stay in the standard king room. Room had plenty of space and bathroom had lots of counter space. Service was excellent. Location in the middle of town meant we could get anywhere on foot. Walked 80k in 5 days :) Many nice touches and extras such as continental breakfast| water| coffee all day| afternoon wine and cheese and lovely card and bottle of wine for our anniversary. We will be staying here next time we are in NYC!,
3,Delightful Getaway,Had the pleasure of staying at Hotel Giraffe recently and would definitely return. We were greeted in our comfortable room with a bottle of wine| chocolates and wishes for a happy anniversary :) Staff is pleasant and accommodating. We enjoyed breakfast and snacks in the lobby. The rooftop garden/bar is lovely. Loved the location| too.,
76,Excellent,We stayed 4 nights at Giraffe hotel last september 2018. Our stay was perfect. The staff is very kind| the room was confortable and the breakfast good. The hotel is well situated to discover NY. Next time| we'll choose again Giraffe.,
1,Great Location and Service,The location is great| the staff support excellent.  It was nice to have wine and appetizers in the evening and continental breakfast in the morning.  The only complaint we have is that the room was so dark and the light insufficient.,
5,Hotel Giraffe,Great location for us| returning clients. Staff are attentive without being intrusive. Accommodations very nice (suite). Easy access to Chelsea| Eataly (don't miss it)| midtown without being in the thick of it,
6,Favourite NYC Hotel,This was my second stay at the the Giraffe| and it did not disappoint. This is hands down my favourite place to stay in NYC. From the beautiful rooms to the attentive| excellent service| there is nothing that isn't top notch here.,
6,Great spot,The location is excellent - very convenient.  The complimentary breakfast and wine/cheese reception are perfect.  Gabby is a delightful server.  We also appreciated the daily turn down service.  Excellent value. ,
1,Awesome Hotel!!,I stayed at the Giraffe last week| and I was pleasantly surprised. A great boutique hotel in the best part of NYC!! Will definitely be back! Would recommend to all| the complimentary breakfast and complimentary happy hour. Just Amazing!!,
6,Giraffe Hotel| New York,This hotel was recommended by my sister. So we decided to stay here again when we went to visit New York for my birthday.   This hotel was awesome| it’s a great place to stay. Staff and facilities were excellent.  If you go to New York I highly recommend that you stay at this hotel.,
102,A hotel where you actually feel welcome,As it is not easy for us to find a decent hotel in NYC| we decided to return to Giraffe| where we already stayed once| many years ago. Upon arrival there was already a good feel about being there and the staff at the reception was really nice (not just the usual robotic polite - nice!). We also received an unexpected upgrade| which does not affect this review other than me writing this with a smile on my face.   The room was on the small side however cosy enough| the bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was as it should have been. The breakfast is for American standards OK and it saves you some time as you do not have to look around for a place to eat when you get out in the morning.  It is not the cheapest hotel| but we think we will definitely return.,
14,Nice hotel,I loved the hotel. Nice location. Big rooms| and the bed was amazing with at lots of pillows and a big duvet. Breakfast was good. In the afternoon| free wine|(red and white wine| and prosecco) nuts| dip| vegetables|  cheese and bisquit| lovely. The  best staff| serviceminded| loved the chocolate on the pillows every evening. Nice neighborhood with a lot of good restaurants. Can hardly recommend the hotel. 👍🏼,
14,Nice| comfortable| and easy.,Stayed four nights with husband and two kids (12&14). Enjoyed our stay. Staff was great and rooms were comfortable. The location was convenient to many great restaurants and shopping. 15 min walk to grand central. The continental breakfast was good and staff attentive and the afternoon wine and cheese was lovely as well. The lounge area was very inviting and comfortable. Would stay there again and recommend to anyone who wants to stay in a smaller| boutique hotel,
193,Very good hotel in the Big Apple,We decided to stay at the Giraffe for 3 nights on the last leg of our trip. We’d previously stayed at the Library hotel and loved it so we thought we would give another hotel in the group a shot.  The rooms were good| beds fine and the afternoon drinks and breakfasts in the morning are really good for their convenience and as a place to relax in the hurly burly of Manhattan.  Location is also good. Close to many attractions and restaurants and not too far to walk across town to the High Line or uptown to Central Park.  Staff were generally very helpful and accommodating although our only small beef was some advice from the front desk/concierge was not quite to the standard we expected. A restaurant recommendation we were given was not great.   All in all though this is a good…,
4,My go to hotel,I have been coming to this hotel for 15 years. Probably stayed here 11 times. Great staff. Location on the subway line is great. Great breakfast and can’t get enough of the free wine and cheese at night.,
1,Beautiful| but no access to rooftop.,I chose Hotel Giraffe for the rooftop amenity| however they had it booked out for private parties for the entire duration of my stay. I likely won't return as a result| as I wouldn't want to risk investing in a stay that was average. Additionally| I didn't receive great service at the restaurant and it too closes quite early.,
197,Brilliant stay,NYC has so many hotel and accomodation choices that it can be overwhelming.  After much research we ended up at the Giraffe based largely on its consistently good reviews - and we can now happily add to those. From before we checked in (they helped us out minding bags before check in) to after we left (returning important documents to us that had been inadvertently left behind in a safe) the service was exceptional.  In particular we want to mention Gabrielle who looked after us exceptionally (and many other guests!) at the great breakfast and wine and cheese hour each day - both of which are part of the room rate. The rooms themselves are a good size and impeccably clean.  There is a terrific rooftop area to sit and enjoy some quiet time (or a cocktail).  Overall a great…,
12,Great place to stay,Really enjoyed the hotel.  Didn't get to take advantage of the breakfast or wine time as much as we'd hoped| but that's ok.  It was still nice to have the option.   Room was cozy| staff was friendly| comfortable bed!,
178,Small is Beautiful,My wife and I stayed here recently and can't say enough about this warm and welcoming hotel.  The rooms| while small| are well appointed and the bedding is terrific. The lobby has a wonderful feel to it and the free morning coffee/breakfast buffet and evening happy hour (with a terrific pianist to boot) fosters a sense of openness and friendliness among the guests.  We will definitely return.,
144,Boutique at its best,Terrific location in the Big Apple and all the charm of a small| boutique hotel.  The attentive| friendly staff attended to my every request and many questions.  Complementary amenities: a generous Continental breakfast with helpful staff| wine cheese and snack buffet in the evening| cookies and beverages available in the comfortable lobby all the time| bottles of water in the room| and turn down service at night.  My double room was spacious| clean| and beautifully furnished with large windows opening to a Juliet balcony.,
1,Mostly great,Pros:Great location| central to everything we wanted to do. Breakfast was nice as well as evening snacks although we rarely made it back in time for that. Hotel was quiet with the exception of demo going om starting at 7:00 am but can’t blame the hotel for that. Great front desk and breakfast staff. Always friendly and helpful. Cons: We had a king suite. Nice sized rooms but very dim lighting made for a semi claustrophobic week. Also| our room was oddly damp. We thought it was due to the extreme humidity and rain but the last night our sheets were actauuly wet. Our books and things were soggy in the morning. We reported it to the front desk upon checkout so hopefully the air conditioning was fixed for the next guest.,
1,I Love this hotel.,Like staying at a home. Staff is incredible. Love this boutique home away from home.  Location perfect. Front desk fabulous. Maid service valet service room service cleanliness outstanding. Wonderful place. ,
1,65,Awesome hotel for a young family,My recent stay at the Hotel Giraffe was my eighth trip to NYC. While there are some hotels in the city my wife and I have truly enjoyed over the years| staying at them is no longer practical now that we have a 3 year old daughter. This hotel is offers suites| its located close to several subway stations| there's a nearby a playground at Madison Square Park and numerous quick dining options like Shake Shack or Eataly. Its central location means you're never riding the subway for too long or making numerous transfers. You need all of these things when you're traveling with young children in a big city.  The King Suite at the Hotel Giraffe suited us perfectly. The pull out couch is actually very comfortable! Even a second floor room was surprisingly quiet. The suite offered plenty…
35,Great Return Visit,Aware we were visiting NYC a year on| there was no doubt in our minds that it would be to Hotel Giraffe.  Not for one minute did we regret our decision.  It was just as good as we remembered| and hoped it would be.  Lovely warm welcome from Manny| which epitomises this hotel.  The staff are just so friendly but professional and polished.  You feel so welcome staying here| from the doorman to housekeeping.  You cannot help either setting off on your day in a good mood| or returning to what feels like home| finishing it off in similar spirits.  Seeing the fabulous Gabriella again was brilliant.  She is still as lovely| taking time for everyone.  An absolute treasure| and as professional as ever.  Very briefly| added attractions to the hotel include good choice at breakfast| with…,
42,Friendly oasis in a busy city.,The rooms are large and ours had a small balcony as well. The staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast is a basic continental| but fresh and ample. The highlight of the day is in the lounge area where wine and cheese is provided from 5.00pm - 8.00pm. The position is also excellent| being on a subway line and close to the Flatiron District and Gramercy. I would definitely stay again.,
795,I’m playing hotel roulette - I won!,I aftually have an apartment in NYC but I’ve been renting it out for a few years so when I come to NY on business| I try a different “boutique” hotel each time. The Giraffe is a nice property confidently located on Park near 26th. Easy to get anywhere in the financial district or a p puts you in midtown. They booked me into a “classic” King suite and it was actually larger than I had expected. Somewhat funky decor but not of-putting. The staff were fine - very professional and eager to help. The included (yes included) breakfast was a notch above the typical hotel continental which was fine. I did get back to the hotel in time for their daily wine and cheese reception and met some very interesting people. It was a nice respite after a long day. I did not have a chance to dine at…,
3,Poor management and customer service. Dirty. There were bugs in the bed. Not a pleasant experience for an anniversary tr,Poor management and customer service. Dirty. There were bugs in the bed. Not a pleasant experience for an anniversary trip. After first night| could not sleep| due to fear of the bugs. Management finally acknowledged the issue and compensated for the issue after several calls.,
2,Wonderful,The Giraffe was one of the highlights of my stay in NYC. Great location| friendly staff| modern| exceptionally clean and well maintained| and reasonably priced for Manhattan. The Giraffe was everything I was looking for in a hotel. After reading such great reviews I was hopeful| and very happy to find That it was actually better than expected! I could go on but it would sound more like advertising. Thanks for a great stay!,
3,Fantastic hotel!,Delighted with my 4 day stay at Hotel Giraffe! The staff| from the reception/concierge|housekeeping| ladies hosting breakfast and the evening wine reception and door men were all very welcoming| helpful and enthusiastic about their work which made the hotel a very nice place to stay. The hotel is on the pricier side| but the amount of free amenities available daily from breakfast| tea/coffee/snacks| evening wine/snacks| bottles of water| turndown service all adds up saving some $$ each day. This was my 2nd stay this year and I'm already looking forward to returning again!,
3,Fantastic hotel,Can't fault anything about this hotel| from check in to check out we had no problems whatsoever| room was good and very clean| free breakfast was good and served by great staff who always remembered your preferences. Free wine and cheese in the evening was great and usuall served by Gabby who always had a smile on her face and always had time for a chat and a laugh| well done Gabby and thank you to you and all the great staff at this hotel| would recommend it to anyone| location is good for getting to most places in New York.,
15,Oasis in the Flatiron District,Fabulous hotel with wonderful service. Gabriella was especially attentive and genuinely warm with every guest and looked after us at breakfast and evening wine and cheese. The hotel let us leave for several days before we had even checked in and looked after all our requests. The location in the Flatiron District is wonderful| with Madison Square Park one block away| and great restaurants in the neighborhood. Union Square and Washington Square are just short walks away. We enjoyed our champagne on the rooftop sitting area. The Hotel accommodates couples and friends traveling together very well. We would definitely stay here again. ,
4,Fantastic experience in every way,Beautiful hotel| excellent staff and service. Nothing was too much trouble. All the extra inclusions make it well worth the money i.e. breakfast| wine and cheese evening| all day tea/coffee pastries biscuits and fruit. We stayed in a suite as a family which was perfect for us| lots of room. Couldn't fault anything with our stay. Very highly recommend. ,
2,Beautiful Boutique Hotel is a Hidden Gem,Favorite hotel in NYC!The service is incredible!Staff warm and friendly! Hotel is clean and surprisingly quiet. Comfy bed and soft pillows!The daily continental breakfast is wonderful with bagels| pastries| cereals| and fruit. Coffee and cappuccinos are made and delivered to your table! The evening wine| champagne  and cheese offerings are a pleasant treat after a busy day in the city! Piano music and a beautiful lobby enhance the experience!Absolutely love this hotel!,
126,Perfect home away from home in NYC,The location is brilliant| about 6 min on Uber to NYU and a few mins on foot to Union Square.  Breakfast is wonderful and offers fresh fruit and pastries in the lobby.  Service is excellent from bell captain to front desk to lobby.  I also love the wine and cheese hour daily| a great way to unwind from the day. I enjoy the classic suite and provides room for my teenger to have privacy and spce.  A great choice for NYC.,
47,Perfect location,We have stayed at this hotel many times and it is consistently good. The rooms are well appointed and if you book it in advance a coffee maker is also available. The breakfast is excellent with cereals|fruit|boiled eggs|bread and pastries| fresh fruit and yogurt. There is a good selection of teas and coffees. The added bonus at the Giraffe is the cheese and wine time between 5-8pm. It is so good as wine in NYC restaurants is so expensive that you can have a drink before you go off to eat. Gabby who serves the wine is the perfect hostess and makes the stay even better. The hotel is in a great location|handy for the subway and Union Square. Around the area are many restaurants and one even attached to the hotel.,
42,A very pleasant stay,I booked this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and was not disappointed.  The staff were very friendly and helpful at check-in.  My room was fabulous - far larger than I would have expected| nicely decorated and well-appointed with a large desk and plenty of closet space.  The continental breakfast provided a good start to the day and the ladies serving in the breakfast were very pleasant and helpful - just lovely!   The location was also great. I look forward to returning.,
3,Best bang for the buck,Hotel Giraffe is the only place I stay in NYC.  The rates are totally reasonable.  The staff is great.  The morning breakfast and evening cocktails are free and a big money saver in a city like New York.  The rooms are spotless| the rooftop bar is lovely| and being able to get a balcony room is a big plus.  I can't say enough about how much I enjoy this hotel.,
1,Robert Davenport,All hotel and dining room staff were cordial and helpful when we arrived under stressful conditions.  We were a walk-in to the hotel after learning that our apartment building had a fire and we had lost power and gas.  The gracious staff were delightful.  They even referred us to a late night pub where we could grab a bite| a beer| and contemplate our plans for the next day.   ,
8,Spacious room| great location,Stayed here in August 2018 with wife and son in a King Balcony Suite. Room was very spacious by any standard (but especially huge by NYC standards) with a charming balcony overlooking the street. Very good continental breakfast with 24-hour coffee and tea also available. As a smoker I appreciated the rooftop lounge that is accessible any time| with drinks and snacks available in the afternoon/evening.  My only minor complaints are that the elevators are not properly synchronized and you can end up waiting a relatively long time| and while the room windows do a good job of isolating city noise the room doors do not block hallway noise| including people slamming their doors at all hours.  The hotel is in a very good| central location| easy to walk to most parts of midtown and a…,
3,Very Comfortable,We really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Giraffe. The location was great| the room was very comfortable and clean. The continental breakfast and the evening Happy Hour were very nice. The staff was always pleasant and very helpful. ,
128,Giraffe – a nearby perfect city hotel,The giraffe is perfectly situated for guest and tourists that like to have many attractions in walking distance.  We were surprised about the generous (complementary) coffee bar in the lobby that turned out to be a great place for a wine-cheese hour in the evening. A nice coming back after a busy day! The rooms are convenient and well maintained. Next time we will book a room in a higher floor since the noise from the streets was sometimes quite disturbing (1st floor) The service at the reception and in the lobby was throughout our stay impeccable. The giraffe can easily compete with the BIG names in town.,
8,Very enjoyable stay ,Last week we had the good fortune of staying in the Giraffe hotel | perfect location in the city with lots on your doorstep in walking distance | spacious comfortable rooms | excellent staff and lots of little added bonuses with complimentary wine and cheese | would recommend the giraffe to anyone ,
1,Great hotel,I love this hotel. Rooms are immaculate. The snacks and beverages in the lobby ser this place apart. Sometimes you just need a small cup of coffee. They give it to you instead of you having to go out and find a place.  Great place on every front. ,
7,Hidden Gem,This place is a joy to come back to trip after trip. The staff is friendly| the rooms impeccably clean| and the location is close to the High Line| Eataly and Times Square. We enjoy the breakfast and wine hours and save a considerable amount by taking advantage of both. Close to wonderful restaurants and bars and slightly off the beaten path so it's great to come back to after your day in the city. Highly recommend!,
87,50 trip,I had enjoyed my stay here on a girl trip about ten years ago.  Decided to rebook for our 50th wedding anniversary trip.  The hotel had a bottle of wine and chocolates waiting for us in our room with a nice note.  We partook in breakfast each morning and once for the wine reception.  Turn down service was nice to come back too.  Everyone behind the reception and food counters were as nice as they could be.  Hopefully we will be in NYC again.    My husband loved the location and all the newspapers too.,
2,Wonderful stay| customer focused friendly staff| we will be back!,I stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for 4 days while on business but also traveleing with my 5 year old son. The hotel staff went out of their way to make us feel at home and ensure we were happy and comfortable and always greeted us with a smile. Gabriela's hospitality at the evening happy hour was exceptional| she looked after us with geniunine friendliness and high quality service. Our suite was spacious| clean and perfectly located for our needs. No request was ever a bother and all asks were quickly and professionally addressed. Thank you to the Hotel Giraffe team for such a pleasant stay| we will re-book without any hesitation and look forward to our next visit.,
1,Perfect NYC stay,Giraffe offers unpretentious luxury and comfort in a small boutique-y package.  It is on relatively quite Park Ave| steps from Madison Square park| which allows visitors equally easy access to Uptown/Central Park|  Mid-town/Times Sq./Theaters|  Chelsea/Village and downtown. There's no shortage of local good dining spots either. Check out Sarabeth| Upland or BarbouniaI stayed at Giraffe 9 years ago and the hotel and rooms have not aged one bit. This is clearly  an impeccably maintained property. While priced just below big-name mid- and up-town hotels| Giraffe offers complementary extras such as a a high-quality continental breakfast| a wine-cheese hour in the evening and coffee| cookies and fresh fruit all day. The lobby is a bright| cozy and inviting room and lobby staff were…,
291,Continues to be Outstanding,Excellent service| very spacious and comfortable room| and a convenient location.  I've stayed here over a number of years| and they continue to sustain top quality hospitality.  I would recommend a room on a higher floor (we were on the 11th).,
13,Stayed  For Business Will Return For Pleasure!,We travel to NYC a few times a year.I stayed here for business as it was across the street from where I needed to be but the hotel and service are really perfect- plan on returning soon with my husband soon.,
2,Recommend Hotel Giraffe,Good location mid-town if you are a walker like me - can walk to Central Park/Museum Mile or Lower Manhattan/Brooklyn in roughly an hour; about 30 mins walk to Times Square or Greenwich Village. Rooms good size for NYC - well maintained and clean. My room faced 26th St and no noise issues. Friendly and helpful hotel staff. Good value for money. Would stay again.,
9,Boutique hotel with fabulous hospitality,I stayed in this hotel for a few business meetings in NYC. The location was ideal as I could walk to Midtown as well as Downtown quite easily. Upon check in my room was upgraded to include a balcony which I really enjoyed! Morning breakfast and happy hours were such a thoughtful touch at this property. The rooftop bar is beautiful| a nice spot to unwind or even take some photos as it provides the perfect backdrop. As a guest (and someone in the hospitality industry) I felt that the entire hotel staff did an exemplary job of conveying great service and met all of my needs while I was on site. I will certainly stay at Hotel Giraffe again and would like to check out other Library Hotel Collection properties.,
12,Best place to stay in New York,We stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for a week on our family vacation.  This was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.  First| it is a suite hotel; perfect for a family of three. Second| there is free breakfast and a nightly happy hour.  Third| the staff is amazing.  Before my trip| I emailed the hotel (via their website) with questions about things to do. I received a response immediately with lots of information.  During our visit| the staff continued to provide us with directions and answers to our questions.  The staff that helps with breakfast remembered our preferences (toasted bagels and black coffee) every morning.  Gabriella served us drinks every night.  Again| she knew us after just one night|  She has a great smile.   The two bottles of water in the room were…,
48,Amazing Giraffe ,We had an amazing stay at this place for 5 nights last week.  Location: we found the location of this place to be a great advantage. Very close to subway| restaurants and Penn station as well as Flatiron and Empire State Building. A lot of shopping options on the 5th Avenue very close by.  Customer service: they do so well in this area - small but cozy lobby which hosts reception area| serves breakfast in mornings and serves wines and cheese evening over piano jazz. We requested to check us in sooner and they did oblige. The room we had was spacious| with plenty of storage space| squeaky clean bathroom and we loved it. We were on the 5th floor with a balcony and could see NYC pass by.  Evening cheese and wine: that had a very relaxed atmosphere. Gabbie in lobby does an amazing…,
9,Hotel Giraffe,Great hotel. Very clean. Comfy beds. Friendly and helpful staff. Good location.  Excellent breakfast and early evening drinks and snacks. Definitely recommend. No complaints. Will return when back in New York.,
27,Birthday wonderful,We celebrated my wife’s birthday on Saturday night. Her restaurant favorite is Hillstone on the corner of Park Avenue and 27th. Across Park Ave is our favorite Giraffe Hotel. We were assigned 1203 where we had stayed previously. Allow me to tell you of our experience. Firstly| the lobby serves complimentary coffee and expresso through out the day. The included breakfast is another delight. The real surprise is the free wine and cheese served in the afternoon. The Mondavi Cabernet certainly pleased me. During the  event a very good pianist performs on the lobby piano. What an enjoyable experience. All this good and I have not yet addressed our room. 1203 is a delight —-quiet with a balcony view of the local park. An outdoor roof terrace is just across the hall. The shower was…,
1,Neighborhood Gem,"This was our fifth stay at Hotel Giraffe. This hotel is amazing| from check in to check out. The rooms are beautifully decorated and larger than most in NY. They include a refrigerator| large closet| and big bathroom with shower tub combo. Continental breakfast| wine and cheese ""Happy Hour"" are included| served in a beautiful lobby. If you're lucky| Gabby will be hosting. There is an attached restaurant and roof top bar (seasonal). The location is perfect| with plenty of restaurants and shops| and the subway is less than one block away. But the best amenity| by far| is the staff. They are helpful| courteous and always friendly. ",
10,Perfect place to stay while in NY,Great location| easy to get to and very accessible to the subway as 2 blocks for the #6 to Grand Central Station or a 12 block walk if up for a little exercise. Hotel Staff is so helpful and the King size bed is the best sleep you will have. We had a balcony room that is surprisingly quiet with the door closed (typical city noise of sirens and horns was minimal and we slept great with our room right on Park Ave South).Great Irish pub called Desmond’s Tavern just down the street (awesome burger/fries and beer for $9) and also Vezzo Pizza (fire brick oven) on 31st & Lexington (short 4 block walk from hotel).,
3,Hotel Giraffe,Best place to stay in NYC| I'll always stay here.  Great location| amazingly helpful staff time and again. Complimentary breakfast and Happy Hour were both classy and appreciated| pianist during happy hour was a plus.,
2,I LOVE Hotel Giraffe,BEST Customer Service| warm and personal staff everywhere!  Your Hotel is BEAUTIFUL| Thank you for always being so friendly| such a wonderful staff.  THANK YOU for always making my Mother/Daughter time together in New York so special.  I have stayed here 3 times in 2018!,
2,Always Amazing,Incredible staff and impeccably managed and maintained hotel.  Our favorite on all of New York City.  Great location in an awesome neighborhood.  Best part of every stay is how well we are treated all the time.  A truly authentic| warm and caring group of people here that are like a family to us.  We be back many more times!  ,
1,Family friendly hotel,Like the the option of connecting rooms with a separate living room| perfect for family gathering| especially good for a toddler.  There's a beautiful park nearby| plenty of restaurants & subway is not too far to walk,
215,The best!,We returned to Hotel Giraffe recently| anticipating another great stay.  It is hard to meet expectations from previous wonderful visits| but once again| Hotel Giraffe was superb in every way. Perhaps the greatest asset (and there are many) is its staff| who will do anything to make guests comfortable and  happy. From the doorman| to the desk staff| to the breakfast and wine & cheese hosts| these are gracious people. Our room was lovely| with a small balcony overlooking Park Boulevard. Virtually all street noise| except sirens| was kept at bay by the doors that open to the street. The breakfast| included in the room rate| was fabulous| with fresh fruit| all sorts of breads| juice and great coffee. We really enjoyed the daily wine and cheese event and our hostess| Gabriella|…,
29,A haven from the madness,What a delightful hotel. We arrived exhausted and disheveled after our trip from Cardiff| UK and received such a warm welcome. Our room was ready even though it was before check in which was a great relief. The room was lovely if a little dark but apart from that the room was so comfortable. The hotel is in a great location with everything you need nearby and relatively quiet. The complimentary breakfast was most welcome and the cheese and wine in the evening was an ideal way to start the night. Everyone was so friendly but I have to give a special mention to Gabrielle. She is fab and so efficient. Although constantly busy nothing was too much trouble and she never forgot anything you requested. A lovely hotel  with personal touches and we’d love to con back one day.,
7,Great hotel,This is a GREAT Hotel! The only place that I stay when I travel to New York| The people are great| the rooms are impeccable| and it is one of the few hotels that actually have balconies!Stay here once| and you won't stay anywhere else!,
1,Mother/Daughter-Trip to NYC,I can highly recommend the Hotel Giraffe. The staff was very friendly. The rooms are very nice and clean and every day we had two| complimentary bottles of water in our room! The free Wine/Cheese from 5-8 p.m was great!,
114,Lovely hotel,Loved this place| from the comfort of the spacious room to the fabulous wine and cheese| the perfect place to experience the big Apple. You can not fault this hotel on any level| and the best of all is the amazing customer service. It’s a pure gem,
6,Always top-rated service!,For the 5th year in a row we enjoyed HOTEL GIRAFFE. A family of three| the entire experience is top-notch| with terrific breakfast| wine and cheese and rooftop patio. The staff is always great| the piano bar is wonderful and we keep going back for more. See you next time. :),
6,Very comfortable hotel,very friendly and helpfull staff; relaxed atmosphere| espcially the cheese & wine-hour in the late afternoon; well situated in the flat iron-district with lots of sights and interesting places around;breakfast could have a little bit more selection but was okayvery friendly service (especially Gabriella!),
4,Weekend in NYC,The hotel is perfect for a trip to NYC. The hotel is located in a very strategic area in midtown. The hotel employees are courteous| friendly and helpful. Of particular note is Gabriela| the young lady who makes the morning breakfast and evening “Happy Hour” a most enjoyable event,
48,Great Boutique hotel in Rose Hill section of NYC,This was my first stay at the Giraffe Hotel. I stayed 4 nights. Room was well appointed. It had a comfortable bed and a large TV. My room had a small balcony overlooking Park Ave. The bathroom was clean and the housekeeping services were great. Free wine and cheese from 5-8pm and a free Continental breakfast eash morning. The fron desk staff were always warm and welcoming. I would definitely stay there again.,
1,Fantastic Service,My daughter and I spent three nights at Hotel Giraffe last week. The staff could not have been more pleasant| kind| and conscientious. Our room was lovely and clean. We look forward to returning soon. ,
1,Great Hotel Great Location,Thanks Hotel Giraffe for another wonderful holiday.  Great service| super friendly and helpful staff made our stay so memorable.  Love the location - you can walk everywhere.   Would definitely recommend Hotel Giraffe!,
7,2 Night Stay at  Hotel Giraffe******,During the month of August on Saturday|  a few streets are shutdown for the joggers to run till 1:00.  We picked a Saturday!  As we continued to drive with barricades every other street| it made it impossible to get to the hotel.  Did I mention it was raining buckets? I contacted the Front Desk| spoke with Gaby...she was our HERO!!!!  She asked us the cross streets and sent Jose and another gentlemen to pick up our car and luggage!  I knew everything I read about Hotel Giraffe would be exceptional.  Entire staff exceeded any 5-star I have stayed anywhere!!!,
120,Friendly helpful staff| clean rooms| great cocktail hour!,The location is excellent| very central. We stayed for 3 days and walked in different directions each day to different sites| and because the hotel is so centrally located| taking a taxi back was a very reasonable cost when our feet had had enough!  As of August 2018| the decor is fresh| clean and cool. The reception| door| bar and breakfast staff are lovely| we felt very looked after. having coffee and tea at any time of the day or night is a nice touch. I have stayed at the Casablanca| another equally lovely Library hotel| and I will stay again.,
41,2 nights stay at Hotel Giraffe at Library New York,Arrive just 20 minutes short of 3pm for check in time. Room King suite was not ready but wine and drinks were provided whilst waiting. Subsequently a bottle of chardonnay were provided by way of an apology.It is true from all the reviews that the staff are very very friendly and helpful. The room/suite was of a good sir for New York and well kept in terms of decoration. Everything works and we requested a kettle for tea making and was complied with. Breakfast and wine / cheer in the afternoon were as described on many reviews. The location of the hotel is fine and with uber being available at a few minutes pick up time to go anywhere its an excellent location. No complaint at all about the hotel and would visit it again with no trouble at all. There is a roof top garden area and…,
3,Another wonderful stay at Hotel Giraffe!,We travel to NYC a few times a year because we love the City.  For the past several years we have stayed exclusively at Hotel Giraffe.  The staff| including Jose the door man| is excellent.  Each time we return| they welcome us with open arms and often comment| ,
5,good place,a good hotel to in new york city you can also visite this place with your friends neat place and good bed and more facilities in the hotels thay take take care more and good food and drink good climate,
1,I love the Giraffe!,The Giraffe is our favorite hotel of all time!  The customer service is phenomenal.  It’s almost like going to Cheers——where everybody knows your name!  Giraffe also has the best happy hour of any hotel I’ve been to.  Lastly| it’s surrounded by many different places to eat and hangout late at night.  ,
24,Great location and cost,Anyone going to NYC should stay here. The location is perfect in mid town. There were subway stations very close in any direction. And we could walk to nearby sites very easily. The rooms are clean and classy| but not big| as you would expect in NYC. Included breakfast - muffins| toast| coffee| yogurt was all that we needed.,
14,Our favorite NYC hotel!,It's always a treat to stay at The Giraffe! We just came from a another great weekend stay. The rooms are beautiful| and a good size for a NYC hotel. The complimentary breakfast and happy hour are generous and delicious. Best of all is the staff - so helpful and welcoming. All around great spot!,
1,Great Stay!,Hotel Giraffe is a lovely hotel in a great location.   The rooms are comfortable and the lobby breakfast and snacks are a great addition.  I've stayed at Hotel Giraffe twice now| and look forward to my next stay.,
72,Loved our stay; Check out the rooftop,We had three rooms on a family vacation. All of the rooms were lovely and quite spacious for New York.   The service was really awesome. Everyone was very friendly and very helpful. We ate breakfast a couple of times and it was fine; not that much variety but everyone found something they liked. We also attended the snack time one evening and enjoyed it. After a long day walking about we decided to have dinner in but with 6 people it was hard to figure out where. Well| there is a lovely rooftop terrace that we used. It was perfect for us. And they happily guided the delivery person to the roof and provided plates and glasses for us. We really enjoyed our stay!,
1,A great choice in NYC,We really enjoyed our weekend stay at Hotel Giraffe. Notable for the service - always friendly and upbeat (doorman Jose (?) deserves a special shout out| even rescuing our car from Park Ave traffic!). The free lobby breakfasts were excellent| well staffed and managed. The room was newly renovated and much better than other NYC hotels we have visited.  Minor area to work on is the elevator service - particularly slow on Sunday AM when many were checking out.,
65,Lovely hotel and location,The hotel location is great and staff are very accommodating. I highly recommend this hotel. You will not be disappointed. No noise at all from the street. Lovely continental breakfast and wine and cheese in the evening| all complimentary.,
9,Can't wait to return!,My husband and I stayed a night while visiting our son in NYC. We loved everything about the hotel. From JR's friendly greeting at check-in to Gabby's attentive service during the complimentary wine and cheese. The morning breakfast bar was just right - and our room was clean| comfortable - and even came with robes! Be sure you get up to the roof top - what an oasis in the middle of the city. We were able to walk to many nearby stores and sights. We can't wait to return!,
65,Lovely stay in a perfect location,There’s a lot to like about this hotel. The rooms| while not huge| are ample by NY standards and very well laid out| with lots of storage| surfaces to write or put things on| and plenty of light in both the bedroom and bathroom. The free continental breakfast includes fresh fruit| and the free wine and cheese reception is a treat. It’s all very civilized| and the location is convenient to both downtown and the theater. ,
7,Everything was Impeccable,Professional and friendly staff| clean rooms| comfortable beds| and well-priced (considering the deluxe breakfast as well as wine and hor d'oeuvres are free).  Add the live jazz pianist and you have a recipe for wonderful.  When I pass through New York City again| this will be the place I stay.,
2,Love| Love| Love| Love,My favorite NYC hotel!! I have sent 2 of my best friends here and they all loved it too. Gabriela is the absolute best staff ever! I travel to NYC w/my granddaughter for modeling @ New York Model Management & with other members of my family for fun.,
63,Comfortable hotel with excellent service ,We spent a few nights at this hotel - traveling with our two daughters aged 8 and 10 - and we all liked this hotel very much. Our room was comfortable and on a high floor which I requested. The hotel itself was quiet but there is traffic noise from being in a city which I don’t think they can do anything about - I was ok with that. The service was very good and friendly. We liked the breakfast included with our room. I liked the amenities and the location was pretty convenient. The front desk people were great about recommending places to go etc.  Overall| we would definitely stay here again and recommend it!,
1,Awesome Business Hotel. Keep it a secret.,This hotel is centrally located in Manhattan. They have a great breakfast| coffee| pastries. There is a stack of NY Times and Wall Streets for the guests. They have a gym affiliation around the corner. great Gym. Rooms are perfect. beds are perfect. Great Staff.,
21,Great hotel in downtown NY,This place was fantastic in every way.  The staff is extremely helpful & friendly.  The rooms are great & you get lots of extras with your stay (continental breakfast| wine & cheese at night and more).  We would definitely stay here again.,
54,best in nyc,great hotel. wonderful rooms and great staff. location is almost perfect . I stay here every time I visit the city. breakfast is included with room price . one criticism is that they say breakfast is at 7 am yet most days is was not completely set up till around 7:15 am. when pressed for time those minutes are important. I suggest the hotel open breakfast at 6:30 am so business meeting attendees as those catching flights can at least enjoy a meal. that being said everything else was great | restaurant in hotel is great to enjoy.,
5,Hotel Giraffe a Great Place to Stay,This was my first time staying at Hotel Giraffe and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New York. The room was neat and clean and the staff were friendly and very accommodating.  They offer a nice continental breakfast daily and a nice cocktail hour at 5 PM.,
4,Romantic night in the heart of the city,My boyfriend and I had a gift certificate for Hotel Giraffe and we spent a Saturday night there. We currently live in Brooklyn| and were looking forward to a staycation in Manhattan. The location of the hotel is wonderful! You're a 5 min walk from Madison Sq Park and so many attractions (minus the awful crowds of Midtown). We went to Eataly (also a 5 min walk) and had dinner reservations for a restaurant that's literally across the street| something we hadn't realized until we saw it from the window in our room. Anyway| back to the hotel! We really enjoyed everything about it. The staff was very friendly and you get to enjoy a complimentary happy hour and breakfast while your'e there| which is a nice perk. Our room was very spacious| the bed was perfectly comfortable| and the…,
1,Weekend in New York,Everything was wonderful as usual. Manuel and Manny at the front desk were kind| considerate and helpful and as usual check in was a breeze. Gabby who hosts the wine and cheese most evenings was gracious and so hardworking! As are the lovely ladies who work breakfast. I think all the house cleaning staff are great| they do a great job and are fun to chat with. I can't remember the names of the fellows who are usually standing at the front door but they are always friendly and give you a warm welcome on ones return to the hotel after a day out. Also the cookies| sweets| tea| coffee| cold water and fruit are much appreciated any time of the day. I stayed in room 802 this time a queen balcony room. Quiet and nice and cool. This is my and my families home away from home whenever we…,
1,Wonderful stay in Manhattan,My wife and I stayed here for a business trip I was on. The staff at this charming boutique hotel was very attentive and polite. This property hosted a nice continental breakfast every morning and a wine and cheese happy hour every evening. The room was a nice size and included French doors to a patio. The inside of the room was finished nice and always very clean and we had a turndown service every night. All of these things made for an excellent stay in the city for a week. ,
180,We LOVE this place,We stayed here 3 years ago and when we were planning to return| this was definitely going to be where we would stay.  Every member of staff we encountered were 100% there to make sure you had a fabulous time. And we did.  The room was amazing - high up and on a corner. The bed cosy and the wine and cheese was a lovely way to rest your tootsies after all the madness of NYC.  Thank you Hotel Giraffe in 3 years you hadn't changed - you were as brilliant then as you are now.  Will definitely return.,
1,Mother-daughter weekend,A lovely hotel. There was nothing wrong. Nothing at all. We travel frequently. This is the first time that I have ever been able to say that. I will be staying at hotel giraffe again. The staff was attentive. No little extras unpleasantly added to bill. Superb continental bfast| especially the almond croissants ,
5,Ideal Location| Excellant Hotel and Staff,This Hotel is in a perfect Location| with really good size rooms| (we had a suite for our child| who slept really well on the sofa bed!)  We couldnt fault the excellent staff| very attentive| and the cleanliness was great.  The bonus with this hotel is that the breakfast is all inclusive| all buffet style continental| pastries| fruits| cereals| bagels| breads| etc.  In the afternoon between 5- 8pm| there is wine and cheeses on offer.  Having spoken to other guests| who visited New York regularly| they priced the daily all inclusives at approx value $100 per day| compared to having to go out for breakfasts| and drinking free hot drinks during the day| and the wine and cheese at night.  I think this is a fair comparison of costs for say a family of 3/4.  If we would return to New…,
35,Lots of charm,This Hotel has lots of  charm| but. The air con sounded like a jet taking off. Cleaning staff not great. For the price| there are a lot of things that could be improved. Front office| cleaning| replacing air con| change up breakfast,
97,Wow,"My 83 year old mom and I stayed here for 3 nights in July while we were in town to see a show. The rooms are comfortable| clean - ours even had a balcony!- and HUGE for NYC. My mom LOVED the daily breakfast| coffee| and wine service. Quick| easy check in and helpful desk staff. We travel a  LOT and this hotel is hands down in the top 1% in our experience for overall value| service| and comfort. If you are looking a ""tourist"" or first time to NYC experience hotel this is not it. If you've been to NYC before and want a beautiful| comfortable| jumping off spot no need to look further. This is it.",
2,Great Hotel,Rooms were laid out great . Staff and location were perfect . Breakfast was just what was needed  . I would highly recommend this hotel as a place to stay in New York . Everything about this establishment was top notch ,
2,Great stay at Hotel Giraffe,We had a really great stay at the Hotel Giraffe. Everything was clean and tidy and the staff were very nice and helpful. We stayed for 2 weeks and have no hesitation recommending the Giraffe. Excellent position| great facilities. The included breakfast and evening drinks were a real bonus and made the stay that much more enjoyable.,
1,Wonderful hotel,We very much enjoyed our stay at the Giraffe Hotel. The building and rooms are lovely. The staff is wonderfully friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast and happy hour in the lobby is a very nice touch. The location is convenient as well with many restaurants nearby and close to a subway station. Would definitely stay here again!,
8,A most comfortable stay,The room size was generous and well maintain. The front of house staff were exceptional| finding us good places to eat| arranging taxis and helping us find our way around NY. The ladies looking after the breakfast area and serving food and drinks in the evening were also outstanding. Always polite and helpful despite being kept very busy. When staying in NY again this will be my number one choice of hotel. The location is very central Manhattan and most sites are within easy walking distance,
198,A friendly haven in a big city,We spent 16 nights here in July 2018| which seems like a long time but there’s so much to do in New York and the Giraffe is ideally located in midtown to get around.   As our 14 year old was with us we had a king suite with a separate lounge which had a sofa bed for her. If you needed more space you could book two rooms and this combination would result in the door at the entry to the area occupied by both rooms has an additional door so that they could be effectively private.   The rooms are very reasonably sized.  There’s a reasonable amount of storage space and our suite had two wardrobes and some drawers and cupboard space. The bathroom is modest| with the shower over the bath| but neatly set out. The teen found the frosted glass window in the bathroom door a little…,
1,Our Trip to the Giraffe Hotel,We love staying there! It is in a great location and they serve breakfast every morning and cheese and crackers and wine every afternoon...It is a small and well run hotel that is very relaxing with a piano playing..,
18,Gem of a Hotel,We've stayed here before and loved it again on this trip. All the staff are top notch and dedicated to making your stay pleasurable. The added perk of breakfast in the morning| snacks all day and a lovely place for wine and cheese in the early evening makes it so much nicer than most of Manhattan's hotels. Our room was lovely and the hotel even had a celebratory bottle of wine waiting for us for my husband's birthday. Can't recommend the Hotel Giraffe enough. It has become the only hotel we will use when visiting New York.,
5,New York Getaway,Excellent stay! Loved the room and the balcony.  The Happy Hour and Continental Breakfast were a plus! The staff is very accommodating. I left some jewelry in the room and the front desk secured it safely for me.Definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again. ,
1,Great Hotel in the heart of Manhattan,Very friendly staff!! Good sized rooms. cheese & wine reception every day 5-8pm is a great idea. The lobby feels very cosy with a great styling. Good continental breakfast. Maybe they could ad some ham/sausage one day??,
8,Just As Pictured...Excellent|,We stayed in a King Suite and were pleasantly surprised as the room was identical to photos on hotel website. Hotel Giraffe is classy| beautiful| and clean. The staff is also accommodating| friendly| and professional. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely return. Housekeeping was also excellent and deserving of the tip we left.😉 Please note| if staying in King Suite| balcony is not for sitting and relaxing...too small| but cute enough for snapping photos. Turn-down service was very nice! Remember to keep shades closed while dressing as hotel is located at intersection with office building windows parallel in the distance...still an awesome stay overall! ,
13,Great boutique hotel,Exceptional stay.   Hotel is clean.  Great customer service.  Daily evening wine/cheese is a nice amenity.  If i had to think of a con it would be the dark hallways on the guest floors.      Will be my go to hotel when visiting ny!,
12,Has potential to be excellent,Recently stayed for four nights in a King Suite. The Hotel is very nice but is let down by a few minor points that would have made it excellent. We arrived on a red eye from Vancouver and were at the hotel by 10am| just to drop our bags. They checked us in but said our room would not be available until 3pm. We were happy with this so had a day out and returned at 3pm to find that our room still wasn’t ready. We sat for another 20 minutes which I feel was very poor| given the notice the hotel had that we had arrived.   The breakfast is nice| but could do with a little less sugar and some healthier options. The coffee machine was making Luke warm coffee that the staff apologized for. The machine setting was wrong and the company had to change it. It was out of order the next day. …,
128,A special birthday trip,First| it was my birthday ( a big one) | and to ease the pain my husband took me away.  There is nowhere I would rather be than in NYC at the Hotel Giraffe and he knew it. Our stay did not disappoint and was as special and relaxing as it always is. The hotel is in the Flatiron district that is not as hectic as midtown yet accessible to some of the best restaurants| parks  and shops. It is a perfect area to walk wherever you like yet there is easy access to transportation.The staff is friendly| knowledgeable| helpful and efficient. I love this hotel... but don't tell anyone about it | would like to keep it a secret !!,
17,Excellent hotel!,This was our second stay at this great hotel and it is highly recommended. It is small| stylish and they really look after you. I was glad to see some of the same staff and they do a great job. The breakfast is good and each day from 5 to 8 is a free cheese and wine thing which is excellent and at just the right time to break the day and take five. Great midtown location too with everything on your doorstep but not too manic. We look forward to staying again!,
16,An oasis in the hustle bustle of NYC| superb in every way.,We had a perfect stay here May/June 2018. As you step in to the air conditioned lobby it was calm| peaceful and cool. The staff were really helpful and attentive but discreet. The room was decorated and furnished to a very high standard| we had a suite to accommodate our teenage daughter and it worked perfectly. I am very sensitive to noise and had no problems whatsoever| slept really well all week. Free breakfast and cheese and wine every evening which was a lovely touch| the lady who runs it has a great sense of humour. Room service did a great job particularly with my teen daughters mess. Good location and good subway links. I honestly have nothing bad to say about the Giraffe| 10/10 in all areas. Would defo stay again.,
26,Relaxing stay at Hotel Giraffe,There is a lot of choice for NY hotels even within the Library Group. We chose Hotel Giraffe because the standard rooms were a bit bigger and we liked the look of the location (Park Avenue) on Google Maps. We had a 10th floor room with a balcony that gave a restricted view of Park Avenue. There was some street noise but it was not intrusive and we had no trouble sleeping. The room was comfortable| clean and well equipped. As others have commented| the bathroom door had a frosted pane of glass and there was no extractor fan| which may bother some. Service in the hotel is uniformly excellent| and it was always a pleasure to return there after a sweaty day of sightseeing. The hotel does an excellent job of keeping guests happy at the start and end of the day. There was a good…,
283,Feeling at home at Hotel Giraffe!,We stayed here for 6 nights and although we have stayed at more luxurious properties| I still give it a 5* rating. The location is fantastic| close to restaurants and the lovely Madison Square Park. The room was spacious| however the shower was over the bath| which was a bit annoying. Another thing we commented on was the lighting was a bit sparse in the King Suites. A lot of people have already commented on the awkward placement of the doors| but you’ll learn to live with it. The great strength of this hotel is the extras you receive: all day tea| coffee and water with biscuits| a plentiful continental breakfast and a very generous wine and cheese happy hour (well 3 hours actually) in the evening. The service was always great| mainly because of the wonderful staff member…,
47,Great location| fantastic staff| clean rooms,I stayed here in June and the hotel was absolutely fantastic. The staff were fantastic and very welcoming. Nibbles and drinks every night in the lobby were a great end to a long day or the start of a nice evening. The rooms are a little dark but were cleaned daily and very comfortable. Not really a hotel designed for young families.,
2,241,Beautiful Hotel ,This is just 700 meter from metro station and one of the best places I have ever stayed in.  The place is cozy and got a welcome drink upon arrival . Stay here and it's worth to create memories to cherish in future .
5,Convenient and Quiet,This hotel is conveniently located a short walk to train and bus stations so you can easily access all areas of the city during your visit.  Street noise was minimal making resting easy.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.,
5,Family Vacation,Hotel was very nice. It had the room setup we needed for 4 kids and 2 adults. The people were so helpful and nice everyday. The refreshments and breakfast were great and convenient.  Rooms were great with a lot of closet space and very clean.  Location was decent for visiting Central Park and Statue of Liberty,
40,A gem in the heart of Manhattanl,I spent 5 nights at this beautiful hotel with my husband and daughter in a lovely suite on the 7th floor. The room was spacious with 1 bedroom with king size bed and a separate living room area with a double sofa bed. We chose this layout for privacy reasons since our daughter is a teenager and it's nice for everyone to have their space. The room had plenty of closet space and a beautifu large bathroom with plenty of counter space and a bathtub.  The mini fridge was useful and courtesy bottled water was replaced everyday. The only thing missing was a boiler or coffee machine which I would have expected in this type of hotel. I drink coffee first thing in the morning so I missed it.  Complimentary breakfast is served in the hotel lobby lounge which can be a bit overcrowded at…,
183,Cosy comfort,Booked 3 rooms at this good value boutique hotel ... chosen for its ideal location but now appreciated by our family for offering genuine caring service along with the spacious stylish rooms. Special shoutouts to the excellent helpful bellman and Gabriella in the lobby breakfast room who worked hard to accomodate everyone smoothly at a peak busy time. Did get very crowded in there.  Overall| the Giraffe delivers exactly what it promotes and is a great casual neighbourly option for a NYC stay.,
8,Fabulous hotel for your trip to NYC ,I booked a trip to New York on a whim to celebrate a promotion and randomly picked this hotel based on rating location and price. It was a great choice. We had unbelievable customer service. I loved the complimentary breakfast. Great way to justify spending a bit more on the hotel. We used that time to plan out our day and transportation options. The wine and cheese in the early evening are great when you return from your busy day to freshen up for dinner| a little snack and a glass of wine to hold you till your evening plans. The room was spotlessly clean. The restaurants in walking distance were all very good. The area isn’t touristy at all so you feel more like a real New Yorker walking around at night. Great proximity to subways. Can’t say enough good things. ,
506,Reaching the heights of the aptly named Hotel Giraffe!,"This has to be one of the best spots to use as your base to enjoy perhaps the widest variety of Manhattan's fascinating and varied neighbourhoods which are almost all within walking distance. Walk 16 of the short ""street"" blocks north and you're on 42nd street| in the centre of midtown - Grand Central Station to your right| Bryant Park and then Times Square two to three longer ""avenue"" blocks to your left - plus all the exciting retail therapy opportunities north along Madison| Fifth and Lexington Avenues. Walk 12 of those short blocks south and you're in Union Square with its park and various markets. Walk further south into Greenwich Village East Village and the rest of Lower Manhattan. Walk east and you come eventually to the (surprise!) East River. Walk west through Madison…",
108,Great stay,This hotel is a great boutique hotel. Good looking building located in the Flatiron district close to the subway| Madison Avenue Garden and my favourite place Eataly. The service was excellent| starting with Gabriella| who looked after us at breakfast and at predinner wine and cheese. The staff were all friendly| helpful and attentive. Loved the breakfast and wine and cheese| it made our stay easier and  comfortable. The King Balcony room was spacious| very clean| contemporary in style and the bed was oh so comfy. Very stylish. Had a problem with a clogged toilet which was promptly fixed. Great 4 star hotel. Perfect stay. Would definitely recommend and stay again.,
3,Another great Library Hotel!,We had a great room| good continental breakfast| coffee all day| and excellent happy hour.  We were also given a bottle of wine for our anniversary.  Like the Library Hotel| this is another fine hotel in a convenient location.,
106,Fantastic in the Flatiron ,We’re in NYC several times a year (for pleasure) and usually stay at a chain hotel. For this special “couples only” vacation| my husband and I decided to mix things up and give the Hotel Giraffe a try. So glad we did! Everything was first class| from the accommodating/friendly staff to the complimentary breakfast and cocktails to the nightly turn-down service (including towel replenishment.) The room was very spacious for NYC| as was the bathroom. Modern décor| a comfy bed and bathrobes rounded out the experience. Fantastic location in the Flatiron neighborhood| with easy access to both Union Square and Grand Central. I think I know where we’re staying for our next visit!,
12,two suggestions,Wonderful hotel.  always our first choice.  but the shampoo| etc. bottles are annoying to use -- don't squeeze| hard plastic| takes too long to get stuff out -- pretty| but useless.  and the bathroom sink fixtures in room 604 are strangely set so impossible to get water temp mixed properly.  but still| a lovely and friendly place we always enjoy.,
101,Just as good as last time,Enjoyed our last stay so we returned again| it was great.  Rooms are fairly large| spotless and comfortable.  There is a rooftop bar on the 12th floor where you can buy drinks| or between 5 and 8 there is complimentary wine and cheese| crackers in the lobby; complimentary continental breakfast in the mornings too| with pastries| bagels| muffins| fruit| etc.  Parking outside on the street is generally available| especially overnight on weekends| no cost.  All staff are most friendly and helpful. Highly recommend this hotel.,
6,Wonderful service ,I typically stay her for work| but this time came back with my family for a vacation. The hotel staff is simply top notch. The whole staff has been attentive and over the top accommodating. This hotel feels like home every time.,
1,Excellent Stay,The service is excellent. Great location.  Fun lobby with snacks and appetizers and treats in the morning and evening.  I now stay there every time I am in NY. The staff is very friendly and goes out of there way to make you feel welcome. ,
49,It's like being at home!,I couldn't rate this hotel high enough! the staff are amazing..especially Gabriela on the bar and Candida the housekeeper.. so warm and kind. The rooms are clean and spacious| all the little bits and bobs that you might need are already there as they have thought of everything.  Breakfast is amazing| fantastic quality selection and the coffee is fantastic. They serve complimentary wine and cheese between 5-8pm...it's just the little things they do that make it so special. Its lovely to come back into your room and it be clean| beds made etc.. even the turn down service is a special touch. I will look forward to going back. People in NY have a reputation for being rude but this is the friendliest hotel I've ever stayed in.,
11,oasis of calm,My husband used to be a regular visitor to NY and remembered liking this hotel 20 years ago| so we booked again for our one night in Manhattan. He couldn't remember what he liked so much| and on first impression I couldn't tell either. After 24 hours in NYC it becomes clear though.. it has a really lovely calmness about it that is a relief from the craziness outside. The rooms are nice enough (4 stars instead of 5 because I'm used to a bigger bed!) but it's the communal space downstairs that really sets it apart. The breakfast/wine/cheese/lounge room has a lovely light and is set out in a way that really encourages relaxation. Having ice water| tea/coffee| fruit and biscuits available all day is a lovely touch. We will book again next time (another 20 years?).,
4,Absolute Gem,Fantastic place to stay in the madness of New York. Amazing atmosphere and staff. Breakfast was buffet style  with a good selection to choose from . Free Wine and cheese reception in the evening served by delightful staff who went out of their way to remember what you drank. Rooms excellent too ,
35,Definite disappointment ,I booked a stay at the Hotel Giraffe given all the great reviews it had received.... first the cons- we arrived early afternoon and our room wasn’t ready- no big deal| we ate lunch and did a little shopping then returned - still not ready and it is now after 3pm (check in time) the people at the front desk literally stared at me as though I had two heads.... 35 minutes later we were advised that our room was finally ready. The room was nice- not great but acceptable. However the beds were very uncomfortable- no one in our party had a good nights sleep.  The pros- the breakfast staff and the coffee were wonderful. Finally| the valets were friendly and quite helpful. I returned to New York two weeks later and stayed at The Nomad - a lovely hotel with exceptional service! I would…,
1,Fun time and a great staff,I booked this room on short notice and the hotel gave me a great room. A street view of Park Avenue. The buildings surrounding it were very beautiful and had great architecture. It was a short walk to the subway| and to Madison Square Park. Close walking to shopping and dining as well. Very nice neighborhood. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Continental breakfast was so-so| wine and cheese in the afternoon was a great perk. The building had an old feel which was nice but definitely looked it| and the bathroom door was more or less see through. All in all| a great stay with a very hospitable and friendly staff. Would stay again. ,
57,Great small hotel!,This was a great little hotel in a nice walkable area!  All employees were wonderful and friendly!  Room was a little small but that’s just NYC hotels!!  Lots of great places to walk to for food/drinks| etc. enjoyed Upland right across the street and a few other places close by. It was a short| but nice stay at Hotel Giraffe!!!,
2,Perfect location in Manhattan,Location of the Hotel is perfect. Our room (Balcony King Suite) was big| clean and had everything you need. The balcony is quite small and more or less useless| but we like this kind of openness. Breakfast is more than ok (bread| fruit salad| pastries| boiled eggs| cereals| yoghurt| any kind of coffee and juice) and better than expected.  On evenings we very much enjoyed Gabrielas wine and cheese event. Such a sweetheart! Always making every guest feeling welcome and at home with friends. Unbeatable!,
30,Nice hotel ,We found this hotel to be in a perfect location for us. Only two blocks from the flatiron building. Our classic King Room was comfortable| clean and spacious. Staff were helpful and friendly. The only downfall was that the room lacked sufficient natural light and it was a bit dim.  ,
1,Awesome location with great service,Awesome location in the Gramercy/Flatiron district one block from a beautiful park| one block from craft cocktail bars| coffee shops and the subway. The hotel staff was very professional and polite. Room was clean and well appointed. We will definitely be back.,
3,First Class Experience,Once you stay at Hotel Giraffe you will never want to stay at another hotel in the city.  The hotel staff goes above and beyond to ensure their guests are happy and have a wonderful experience.  The rooms are gorgeous and clean; we always stay in a Balcony King.  The breakfast and evening reception are perfect - if you are lucky| Gabriella will be working| she is a gem.  Bread & Tulips is an amazing Italian restaurant in the lower level (guests get 20% off their check).  Also| be sure to check out the rooftop garden| it's a beautiful and fun place to hang out.  Book Hotel Giraffe| you will not be disappointed.,
2,Excellent long weekend escape to NY!,Overall our experience was excellent.  The rooms were clean and well appointed.  The service and attention to details by the staff was over the top.  The roof top patio was a great place to start the evening with a drink and snack.  The continental breakfast in the lobby in the mornings was delicious.,
1,perfect stay,We had a perfect stay in the Giraff hotel.  Friendly and helpful staff  Very good location|  There a some nice restaurants in the neighbourhood  Breakfast is served in the lounge; suggestion: on the roof terrace as well? ,
112,A Near Perfect Hotel,The people that administer and operate Hotel Giraffe do as near a perfect job as we have ever found. Everything is set up to provide the upmost comfort and convenience of the guests. The staff are absolutely first rate. The hotel is strategically located in southern Manhattan and is convenient to public transportation. Other reviews are very positive and they are well-founded,
11,Better Than Excellent,Our stay at Hotel Giraffe was absolutely perfect!  Anyone that has stayed in NYC knows that space is at a premium.  Four of us shared a double queen room and it was very spacious by any standard.  The entire facility is kept immaculate.  There is an entire list of N/C amenities that are available to make your stay even more enjoyable - we chose an in room coffee maker (Kuerig that came with coffee and tea K-cups replenished daily)| foam mattress toppers| memory foam pillows and the possibilities went on from there!  We had bottled water supplied to our room daily.  Hands down| this hotel has the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept in either in the states or abroad.  Free breakfast was delightful with a good assortment of foods as well as an attendant that brought your…,
4,Great little gem of a hotel,Love this place - we have been here probably 10 times. While some rooms are small| they are wonderfully appointed| with lots of storage space| refrigerators| chairs and even bathrobes. The breakfast and cocktail hour are great| and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable.,
3,Birthday Stay,We stayed here for my husbands 40th birthday. There were 2 adults and a 6 year old. The three of us fit very comfortably in a King balcony! The continental breakfast was very much enjoyed as was the wine and cheese in the evening. The staff was very courteous and welcoming! The ladies that run the breakfast & wine/cheese evening are AMAZING! They are so kind and attentive.  It is clearly a well maintained hotel| although some wear and tear was visible (but only if you loooked closely- and I was on the floor looking for toys). We were on the 2nd floor| initially I was concerned about the noise level| however the windows/doors do an excellent job of filtering out the noise. There is also a blackout shade that was truly appreciated after a late night at a Yankee game.   Overall our…,
1,Family vacation in New York,Had a wonderful time with my husband and 2 young children at Hotel Giraffe. This was my second time at the hotel and both trips were lovely. Staff was friendly and accommodating. The rooms were so spacious and clean. The king suite was perfect for our family. Kids on the sofa bed and a separate room For my husband and I. We arrived in the middle of the night due to aflight cancellation and the hotel staff had snacks waiting for us when we arrived at 2 AM| not to mention helping us rebook the original reservation at the last minute without a penalty. The breakfast and personally made coffee in the morning were a godsend. Saved us from Having to deal with trekking out to get the kids fed in the morning. Wine and cheese in the evening was a nice reprieve from the chaos of he city…,
1,We loved Hotel Giraffe!,"We enjoyed a ""sisters' reunion"" at Hotel Giraffe this past weekend and enjoyed an exceptional experience.  We truly felt like the hotel was our ""home base"" during our stay in New York.  It wasn't simply a place to sleep| but it enhanced our vacation and was a place that we looked forward to returning to.  The combination of customer service| friendly staff| guest room| and amenities exceeded our expectations and all of us have visited NYC several times in past and stayed at a range of other hotels.  We will definitely return to this hotel.   What stands out the most are the staff and customer service.  Everyone was professional| friendly| helpful and always willing to go the extra mile to make our stay enjoyable.  The front desk staff and the doormen were always welcoming and…",
1,Great location| helpful staff| nice rooms,This was our second stay at the Giraffe. Great location near Madison Park and Union Square. Close to subway| many fine and casual restaurants nearby. We love the breakfast and wine and cheese reception that are served in the lobby. Rooms are very clean and comfortable.,
5,Stick my neck out,Third time this year| still excellent. Even in 90 degree plus weather the A/C works great. The expresso/latte| etc. machine is available 24/7 and is free. Also included is a continental breakfast and wine happy hour,
18,Lovely hotel,Just spent a lovely few days at the Giraffe Hotel in NYC. Beautiful hotel in every way. Location| amenities| breakfast and front desk service. The bellman is the best .They can’t do enough for you. We’ll be back ASAP.,
58,Almost perfect,We really enjoyed our five-night stay at the Hotel Giraffe and have only a few quibbles.  What we liked: the location was wonderful| so near to subways| great restaurants| Madison Square Park| Eataly| etc| and a very convenient distance from everything we wanted to go to.  It was a lovely charming neighborhood.   We loved how quiet and dark our 10th floor room was and how comfortable and spacious.  We were WOWED by the doormen| who went out of their way to chase down cabs for us| and greatly impressed by the entire staff| from the front desk to the breakfast staff to the friendly housekeepers.  We hope the hotel appreciates what a great staff they have.  We thought the continental breakfast| though not fancy| was varied| fresh| and delicious.  We had a fantastic meal at the…,
1,Great location| great facilities and staff,We were in town for a mix of pleasure and business| with need to be in the financial district| but also wanting to be in the midst of midtown and uptown.  The location worked out great| and the hotel staff and facilities were excellent.  The afternoon wine reception was a real treat| and a great way to relax after the day.  We will stay here again without doubt!,
5,AMAZING 40th Birthday Celebration!,My review is a bit delayed| we stayed at this hotel on May 4th| 2018 and had an absolutely amazing experience.  We are pretty particular when it comes to hotel accommodations and we wanted something special for a birthday celebration weekend - this hotel exceeded our expectations.  The location is perfect| the rooms are  adorable and the staff was simply delightful (the happy hour and continental breakfast are perfect perks!)  When we return to the city| there is no question we still stay here again.  Loved it!,
2,LOved this hotel sooooo much!,I visit NYC frequently and this time on my last night I was treated to a spectacular room at Giraffe| beautiful doors and windows| a view of Park Ave| wine and cheese hour| continental breakfast with hard boiled eggs! I had dinner at the partner restaurant Bread & Tulips. The whole experience was the polar opposite of the 3 nights I was at ANdz on this trip. Thank you!,
36,Lovely hotel!!,Perfect hotel. Took my 14 year old to NYC for 3 nights| and this hotel was amazing. Location was great| easy to walk anywhere. We loved the breakfast and the evening wine and cheese which held us over to dinner after a long day out. The rooms were perfectly clean and comfortable. We loved having the balcony and fresh air! Would stay here again!,
7,An ideal spot for NY!,Loved the location as we were able to walk most everywhere.  The rooms were very nice with large closets which are important for a longer stay.  But it’s the service.  Gabriella pouring wine in the evening| the breakfast crew| and the front desk staff were outstanding.  I’ve stayed at another upscale hotel nearby for 17 years and am a convert to the Hotel Giraffe.,
216,A fantastic find ,The Giraffe Hotel was the most perfect place to stay on our first busy to New York. The staff were super friendly and helpful. The beds were the best we had slept in. We loved the coffee| breakfasts and the complimentary wine and cheese in the evenings. This was a great way to catch up with other travellers. We found the location perfect as well. We will definitely be back.,
24,Fabulous hotel!,We stayed at Hotel Giraffe for a family trip and were very happy with it. Great location| small boutique hotel. It had a quaint but luxurious feeling. Our room (king suite) was wonderful and quite large for New York. We were on the second floor but heard no street noise.   The staff was fabulous| from the doormen| to the front desk staff| to the ladies attending the breakfast bar and wine bar| to the housekeeping staff (who did an outstanding job and we never saw them - no carts in the hallway ever).   We highly recommend Hotel Giraffe!,
3,Fantastic stay at hotel giraffe New York,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at hotel giraffe. The rooms were spotless and very spacious| the staff were very kind and helpful| position was excellent and the breakfast and cheese and wine everyday were great! ,
154,Wish I could just move in!,"Spent two days here for a family wedding (lovely event held on the hotel's rooftop) and couldn't say enough good things| from the always super-friendly and welcoming staff (and not just ""nice for a New Yorker"" nice. The valet was so happy to see my husband I thought my husband had just run into an actual friend or co-worker on the street!) to the very large (especially for New York) and beautiful rooms to the complimentary wine and cheese and breakfast. (In New York!) The staff really| really makes it exceptional| though. Not just friendly but also forward thinking: knowing the Pride Parade was held the day we'd need our car for check-out| the concierge warned us to leave plenty of time for its delivery by the valets| but then ended up retrieving it early for us and parking it…",
12,Fun in NYC Hotel Giraffe !,We loved our stay at The Hotel Giraffe and look forward to returning soon. We thought our suite was generous and private and our room was fairly priced. We enjoyed all the many amenities happy hour| breakfast| free Internet| and 20% off your restaurant (delicious and healthy with a good wine list) it’s also in a nice neighborhood that easy to get around subway busses cabs and ride shares. We found the staff super friendly and helpful. We got good recommendations. It’s a fun neighborhood to walk.,
3,Great stay| wonderful staff,We were so impressed with the service at the Giraffe! Whenever we asked for something| we received it in minutes. The room was well equipped and we appreciated the evening turndown service. The free breakfast and wine/cheese happy hour add a lot of value to the stay. And the rooftop garden is a lovely spot for reading or relaxing on a sunny day.  A few days after checking out| I found that I was missing my Bose earphones (worth about $200)| and I suspected I'd left them in the room safe. When I called the hotel to inquire| they quickly informed me that the earphones were in Lost & Found.  I can't remember the last time I recovered an item of value left in a hotel room!,
2,Very clean and excellent service!,I have travelled to NYC about 20 times| and this was the first time I have stayed in a hotel where I can say that I would definitely return. Our room was spacious and very clean. The service was excellent with staff willing to go the extra mile. And the free evening cocktails and snacks were an added bonus! Even my six year old enjoyed it.,
1,Family reunion,The rooms were very clean and well kept.  The breakfast was very adequate| the staff was very accommodating at both breakfast and the wine and cheese event in the evening. The roof deck is beautiful and relaxing.  I did think that the hotel was very expensive especially when you added all the taxes etc.  ,
21,Perfect!,The staff were cheery and helpful always there when you need them. Food was fresh and dining area pristine with beautiful flowers. Everything felt welcoming| not huge empty rooms. Bedroom with balcony also nicely furnished and spotless. We were with other business people out of state and they all said the same| we’ll come back!,
5,Great stay!!,This was our third stay at Giraffe. Quiet room| well appointed. Wonderful breakfast and enjoyable happy hour.  The staff is outstanding| always welcoming and attentive to any requests. We look forward to our next visit.  ,
4,Best Hotel in New York,Perfect location| perfect service and the best employees. we had a very enjoyable stay in a town that always is awake. the location of the hotel is the best way to see Manhattan and the rest of New York as everything is in walking distance if you like to do that. we will certainly be back again which is 7 or 8th time.,
11,This hotel has a heart.,I had organised a family meeting of people from Australia| Israel| USA (both East and West Coast) and Canada. Only a few had meet previously. Most had never meet other members of this family group before.  Hotel Giraffe gave us special rates so we could stay together and allowed us to use their lobby area and roof top garden for meetings.  The included breakfast was excellent and gave us another opportunity to meet and greet. The service was excellent and the location in Park Avenue S gave us good access to shopping. The rooms were comfortable and quiet. There were great parks within walking distance. I would strongly recommend it.,
32,Top Notch,We visited for a second time this past weekend.  This hotel is fabulous.  Please look no further & just book it!  Rooms are beautiful and clean (and I'm extremely picky| just ask my husband!)| location is terrific & hotel staff is extremely pleasant!  The rooftop area is a real plus as is the small (walkable only) balconys!!  We enjoy being just a short way from Times Sq. away from the hustle & bustle and this spot is perfect! Continental Breakfast is great| always a cold drink| pastries or something to offer when breakfast is not being served| no matter what time of day it is..  Really great to walk into a nice cool lobby (which also seems to be sound proof!) and get a cold drink or a coffee.  We cannot say enough about this place!  They do a wonderful job!,
6,Quick visit,We moved from NYC last year and like to stay in the neighborhood that we lived in. This hotel fits the bill. Perfectly located and the customer service is well performed. We appreciate the afternoon tea| evening wine and breakfast in the morning especially when your on the go.,
7,Another amazing stay at Hotel Giraffe!,We recently stayed here for the second time a year after our first stay and the service and rooms are still incredible and well worth it. We stayed in a Balcony King Suite and once again loved the view of Park Avenue South from the balcony. The rooms are immaculate and the breakfast plus cheese and wine in the evenings in the lobby amazing. Gabriela is the biggest asset to the hotel and we enjoyed seeing her again. This hotel is is a must-stay. We will be back!,
6,Lovely Stay,Room was clean and well appointed. The only complaint would be not enough visible outlets for phone charging. Other than that it was wonderful. Roof top deck was delightful. Breakfast in the morning was a pleasure. Gabrielle was the best!!,
1,Great stay,Very friendly staff| nice rooms| not too noisy for good location in new york.  Near good restaurants and good location near other sights.  Helpful with all of my needs and responsive to calls or in person questions.,
1,Wonderful experiece,Lovely Hotel. My wife and I stayed overnight in the NYC as we were celebrating our anniversary and seeing a play. Upon arriving| we were informed that our room had been upgraded. We stayed in a 10th floor room with a balcony and a beautiful view of Park Avenue. The staff was friendly and courteous and  the room amenities were luxurious. Location was great as well. We were only one block from Madison Square Park and within walking distance of most any kind of restaurant cuisine we could want.  Overall a great experience. We would definitely stay there again if we decide to spend a night in the city.,
20,Perfect Place,We travel to the City quarterly for a medical appointment. The location| treats|  friendly staff| and peacefulness of the Giraffe are ideal. Not to mention| we love the name and the library in the suite.,
1,Awesome,This hotel was awesome from the minute we arrived to the minute we left.  The staff was extremely receptive to our needs not only with our disabled person but also without.  The rooms were beautiful| the Juliette balcony was a great feature for a NYC hotel| and the rooms had all your needs (I didn't see a microwave but I believe they would have brought you one)|  The bathtub in our room was weirdly small - low to the ground for someone who may want to take a bath| and while I loved the bathroom door with the beveled glass| my daughter was a little freaked out that we could see her using the facilities (no one was watching).  The beds were very comfortable and be sure to ask for a memory foam pillow!  Overall| I LOVED the Hotel Giraffe and would stay here again in a heartbeat!,
1,Giraffe break,A great city centre hotel with friendly staff. Really liked the early evening wine and nibbles in the lobby - lovely| attentive service! We had a room on the tenth floor and| considering we were in the middle of New York| outside noise was never that intrusive. Would definitely stay here again whenever we return to the city - highly recommended!,
1,great hotel,The hotel is excellent! The staff is attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is quiet and peaceful. Unpretentious. Loved the breakfast! Everyone was helpful. The rooms were clean. Bath tubs are actually rare these days. Many hotels have walk-in showers which are a disappointment. I was very happy that the hotel has real | big bath tubs.  ,
3,Excellent!,Great location and room. Extremely comfortable bed and the outside noise| given that we were in the centre of Manhattan| was minimal. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and we particularly liked the complimentary breakfast and happy hour Proseccos! Highly recommended.,
30,New NYC Favourite,Between uptown and downtown| this rarity in NYC is a hotel with fabulous personality alongside immaculate rooms and unmatched guest services that included sweetest breakfast start to the day and happy hour revivers.   Staff were exceptional and I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel.,
70,Hotel giraffe| New York,I chose hotel Giraffe because I prefer smaller hotels with personality| and Giraffe hotel definitely was a perfect choice: great location| relaxed and comfortable atmosphere| complementary breakfast that may include a guest| friendly staff| nice bed and room| and fun giraffe theme-I adore giraffes. It is my new favorite hotel in NYC!,
17,Wonderful Staff| Great Location| Well-Maintained,We really enjoyed our stay here. The rooms are modern and clean. The location is terrific. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. Try the restaurant across the street (Upland) - it's fantastic.,
5,Excellent stays,We stayed at the Hotel Giraffe twice in May - at either end of a trip to New York State. We received a complementary upgrade on our first stay as it was my birthday - and got the benefit of staying in one of their suites| which was lovely. The rooms are a really good size for New York| well laid out and spotless. Staff are extremely friendly and happy to help. It is just a great hotel in a great location - and we won't stay anywhere else in New York.,
4,My new favorite in NYC!,This was my first time staying at the Giraffe. It is now my favorite place to stay in NYC. I was warmly welcomed when I checked in| and the staff was friendly and helpful throughout my six-day stay. My room was immaculate as was the hotel. In the past| I've sometimes stayed at hotels that did not have the best soundproofing. My room was quiet| so I ended up sleeping throughout each night. The continental breakfast was more substantive than I had anticipated| and the nightly wine-and-cheese event even had entertainment courtesy of a pianist. I will definitely stay at this hotel when I return to NY. Thank you to the entire staff at the Hotel Giraffe!,
3,Birthday Visit to New York,We had a wonderful stay at the Hotel Giraffe.  There is a lot of attention to detail| from a comfortable room and bed| turning down your bed with chocolates and very nice wine and cheese bar in the evening| and lovely free breakfast. Definitely would stay here again. ,
4,Boutique Gem of a Hotel,We enjoyed our stay at this delightful hotel with gracious staff and amenities.  Every evening there is  free wine & appetizers| with piano music in the lobby area.  We booked a suite that was charmingly furnished with a deeply comfortable bed....and we had nightly turn down service. Located right on Park and 26th is a great location for taking in venues. A very good hotel for the money.,
1,Excellent,We had a very good surprise with the room size for New York. Very relaxing and decorated real nice for our taste plus our stay was very relaxing. The staff very welcoming and would make sure your stay was enjoyable| from the door man to registering to eating breakfast in the morning. The evening wine and cheese was a great start for any evening plans this should be a 5 Star Hotel. Looking forward to our next stay. Thank You to all the staff!,
1,Super stay,Second time our group stayed at the Giraffe in New York| and the second time we found the hotel comfortable| clean| cheerful and accommodating. The breakfast and evening snacks are icing on the cake. We'll choose them again for our January trip! ,
83,Oasis in the Middle of the Big Apple!!,Favorite boutique hotel in NYC!!  I stayed here on a trip to NY with my daughter. The rooms are nicely appointed| elegant and everything is available. The hotel provides you with a list of essentials| in clouding coffee machine for the room if desired... which leads me to my next compliment: Hotel Giraffe takes hospitality to a completely different level| by offering all day coffee| tea| refreshments| and light snacks all day in the lobby. Free continental breakfast (with add-on paid options) is great| as is the cheese and wine service between 5-8pm.  Now you might say| anyone can offer free amenities| breakfast and wine service| but what makes Hotel Giraffe a 5 Star? The answer is simple: its staff.  Every single employee I met was so professional and welcoming. Amira| Jose|…,
2,Fabulous,Cannot fault this hotel| comfortable room with all the facilities you need. Friendly staff and nothing was too much trouble especially the staff on the breakfast bar. A bonus was the complimentary cheese and wine from 5pm superb!! I highly recommended this hotel,
10,Hotel Giraffe New York,We just spent a wonderful 6 nights at the Giraffe and cannot speak highly enough of our experience. The staff were the friendliest and most attentive of any we have come across in NYC. The included breakfast and pre-dinner drinks/nibbles saved us a fortune and the lovely Daniella was the most divine hostess. The location near the Flat Iron was amazing and the rooftop bar was a lovely surprise. Thanks so much to the amazing staff for making our stay so memorable.,
1,Great Stay in NYC,We enjoyed this centrally located hotel. The complimentary continental breakfast and happy hour were lovely. Next time we are in NYC| we will stay here again! The roof top bar was beautiful and relaxing. Bread and Tulips (restaurant) was excellent. ,
4,Stay from 5/29/18 - 6/3/18,We stayed here after reading a review on Tripadvisor| and thought it would be a good base as we were getting married during the stay. We had a suite| so our teenage daughter had her own space. The room was just what we wanted| she loved a bit of room service| anything we wanted was sent up. My wife really wanted a bath tub| so that was something we had also looked for. Breakfasts were good| and the evening cheese event was great. Staff were very helpful| the breakfast staff very cheerful! Would definitely recommend the Giraffe!,
1,Excellent Stay,I truly love my week at this hotel.  Everything was perfect.  The rooms are super comfortable| the staff are extremely helpful and friendly and the breakfast and wine hour really completed my top notch experience.  This is probably one of the best experiences in a NY hotel I have ever had. ,
77,My home away from home,I absolutely love this hotel - what this boutique hotel can’t offer that the large ones do (eg a pool etc) it makes up for 100 fold in its personal service| amenities| outstanding staff and that includes those at reception| the door man |the ladies who service the rooms| and every ever other staff member you come in contact with during your stay.  There is one member of the Giraffe family who is outstanding - Gabrielle who looks after you when you return to the hotel between 5pm and 8pm.   She know what drink you like to enjoy with nibbles - all complimentary - before you head out to dinner.  Every business should have a Gabriella she is a treasure. The location of this hotel is fantastic with a subway station a minute away.  The rooms are quiet| the beds are comfortable with…,
4,Fabulous Visit to NYC,Stayed at The Hotel Giraffe for our 30th Wedding Anniversary and This Hotel exceeded our expectations. The rooms are beautiful with everything you could want. The staff are extremely friendly and welcoming. The breakfast was fresh with a fantastic coffee machine to get the day started and the cheese & wine every evening was a stunning way to relax after walking the City throughout the day.  Thanks to everyone at Hotel Giraffe and we hope to see you all again soon.,
94,Nice and proper| almost elegant,You cannot go wrong with any of the Library Hotels Collection  (although my favorite is still their first one THE LIBRARY H.) Giraffe is great because most of their rooms are very spacious| compared to many NYC accommodations. And they not only offer complementary ,
32,At home,Come and come back| we have enjoyed the staff attitude. This hotel is well situated| inexpensive and quite friendly. The bedroom was classic| may be some aspect could be modernised : lights| bath... Breakfast is ultimate and the drink at 7 also. It is a pleasure to meet Gabriella each year.,
3,Best Little Hotel in NYC,This is very European in size and amenities. We think it’s the best choice for a short or long stay. The service is personalized and you never have to contend with crowds of people as you do in the larger hotels.  ,
57,Great 2nd Visit,My wife and I just returned from our second stay at Hotel Giraffe.  We were pleasantly surprised on our first visit| and we liked it even better this time.  The location is away from the very hectic parts of Manhattan| yet it is close to two subway lines for easy access to anywhere in the City.  It is also close to one of our favorite parks in the City: Madison Square Park. The Staff is friendly and helpful| and the room was comfortable and clean.  The Continental breakfast is okay| but is fine for what it is.  However the Wine happy hour in the Lobby is very nice at the end of a hectic day in the City. It's a great and relaxing way to recharge before a night out| and Gabi| the server| is a delight.  I look forward to returning for a third visit the next time we're in NYC.,
29,Stunning Value for Manhattan,This is a stylish boutique hotel that is elegant but not overstated.  Simple reception is prompt and efficient.  Rooms are very well appointed. Again: simple| elegant| understated| efficient| modern fit out| quiet and clean. Well serviced several times a day by excellent housekeeping staff - alert and responsive.  Easy straight forward complimentary breakfast in the| largely guests only| lobby.   Everything else you need is nearby.  Seriously good value. 5-star at the 4-star price.,
1,Delightful hotel,The location is great. Lots of great restaurants and bars in the area. The room was clean and cozy. The staff were very helpful and knowledgeable.  The complimentary wine and cheese in the lobby was very relaxing. ,
1,Great Find!,We just returned from a four night| first time stay at the Hotel Giraffe.  What a wonderful small hotel.  Every staff member we met - front desk| housekeeping| doorman| food servers - was friendly| attentive and helpful.  The room was immaculate| well-equipped and quiet.  The  location at 26th and Park was very convenient - near pharmacies| wine stores| restaurants| shops| the subway and just a short walk from Union Square.  We really enjoyed the continental breakfast and the wine and cheese happy hour.  Every time we returned to the hotel from a busy day out it felt like coming home.  We didn't see the rooftop terrace because of private events| but we will make a point of visiting it next time.  And there will definitely be a next time... Hotel Giraffe will continue to be our…,
79,Homely stay in great NYC hotel,We have just returned from 6 days in NYC and enjoyed our stay in Hotel Giraffe a lot. Our family suite was perfect| the top floor terrace was nice in warm summer nights| but most of all we enjoyed breakfast and the afternoon wine & cheese in the comfortable common room with a lot of sofas and very attentive staff. This really made the Giraffe a comfortable| enjoyable hub for our exploration of the City. thanks a lot for the great time.  .,
168,Wonderful hotel,This was our 6th time staying at Hotel Giraffe. We love it there. The rooms are clean and well-appointed and the staff is always helpful and hard-working. The complimentary continental breakfast in the lobby makes for a good start to our day.,
38,Gem of a hotel| handy to all NYC has to offer....,From the moment we checked in we knew this place was special. All the staff| from doormen| to check in| to room cleaners| to the lobby hostess - all were personable| engaging and sincerely friendly. We really felt welcome and valued. It has a pleasing European vibe.  While all reviews mention the free lobby wine and cheese reception daily from 5-8pm| this truly went beyond expectation. The selection of quality wines cheeses and snacks are offered generously to guests was a wonderful way to end the afternoon.  We were made to feel like old friends welcomed back each day. We had a Balcony King room on the 12th floor| which had a lovely roof terrace adjacent that all guests could access at anytime. The Hotel Giraffe is ideally situated for easy walks in Soho and there are many…,
3,One of the best,I always enjoy my stays at The Hotel Giraffe. The staff is attentive| professional| pleasant| and helpful. The rooms are uncommonly comfortable| quiet| and well-appointed. Great location with good restaurant  choices within an easy walk.,
26,Great Hotel in great location!,Just back from a 3 night stay at this hotel on a recommendation from a friend.  Loved it!  Great location with a subway close by and lots of restaurants and bars to choose from.  The room was lovely and clean| bed very comfortable| bathroom good size and I liked the robes and slippers.  Complimentary water each day was a nice touch.  I found the complimentary breakfast to be great and we enjoyed the cheese and wine in the evening.  The staff were amazing; very friendly and informative| special thanks to Gabriella for making us feel so welcome| you made our visit!  Would definitely stay here on a return visit.,
1,Great Hotel,Overall a great place to stay in a great location.  Staff very friendly and professional.  Rooms very nice| comfortable beds.  Relatively quiet for a NYC hotel.  Only complaint is the terrible coffee house music played in the morning in the lobby where the continental breakfast is served.  Not only too loud| but listening to the wailing while drinking coffee in an otherwise nice setting not conducive to reading the paper| working| etc.  Light classical or something less imposing would be much better.,
2,🦒🦒🦒,Giraffe Hotel staff and accommodations were excellent. Everyone was courteous and knowledgeable about NYC. All of our requests were met within minutes. Our room was spacious and so comfortable. The lobby was set up like a huge living room| which allowed our family and friends to get together each morning and afternoon. ,
1,First stay in NYC,Simply marvelous--room| staff| overall amenities| location| excellent restaurant| etc| etc| etc. I was a member of a wedding that took place on the Giraffe's lovely roof-top garden. Lovely setting| accommodating staff. Everything was set-up perfectly. Would definitely return. ,
8,Very Welcomed,We stayed 4 nights in the middle of May. What a joy it is to stay there. The people that make up the heart of this beautiful building are a pleasure to see while coming and going. They are always willing to help out and answer questions. The room was beautiful and had exceptional views and amenities...and the common areas did as well. I can't imagine staying anywhere else while visiting the city.,
382,European charm with a great location and top notch service!,We stayed here for a week to attend a college graduation and we were thoroughly delighted with our stay. The location is ideal within walking distance of the subway. The staff is attentive and responded quickly to all of our requests for dinner reservations and anything else we needed. They have a continental breakfast every morning which is more typical of European hotels. The breakfast has nice variety of cereals and pastries.   We had a nice corner room that had a separate living room giving us plenty of space to relax.   We would definitely stay here again!!,
7,The staff treat you like royalty,I booked this hotel for my wedding and wedding party.  It is simply amazing.  The rooms are very comfortable and the beds are dreamy.  They have wonderful continental breakfast in the  morning| and wine and cheese in the evening.  As if that is not enough there is an espresso and cappuccino machine available all day and night.  I cannot say enough about this place.  Comfortable| romantic and a great location.,
5,Our,This is the 7th year in a row that we have chosen the Hotel Giraffe for our girls' weekend trip to NYC.  We love the location| the room| etc.  The staff are incredible and seem to remember us from year to year! Love the hotel and always recommend it to others.,
5,First time in New York,After much research and searches| we decided on this hotel for our first trip to New York and was not disappointed!!! I'll start at the beginning! As we were celebrating our 40th birthdays this year and we're making our yearly trip to the U.S| we decided to have a couple of nights in New York first before moving on down to Orlando. I had found this hotel and (mainly due to the reviews on here)| decided this was the one.  It was expensive| but it was a treat for us and based on New York prices really wasn't that bad. We had a load of luggage and got a yellow taxi. There are people offering you a ride right next to the official yellow taxi's but it is safer (insurance etc) to take one of these. I had read it is a set price to Manhattan etc. The queue moved swiftly and there are…,
1,Nice stay,The room was impeccable| but I was disappointed that my room request was not ready upon check in.  Staff was helpful| but for a boutique hotel it felt slightly impersonal.  Refreshments are a great touch.,
8,Best Hotel in NYC,Just returned from my annual visit to the Giraffe and as always it was just great. The staff| the food and the ambiance. This year I took two friends for their first visit to NYC and they thoroughly enjoyed the hotel as well. Can't wait to go back.,
6,Amazing Hospitality,"This hotel goes out of its way to make people feel at ""home"". Lovely staff| and amazing location. I will definitely stay here again. The location is perfect| and the services| such as breakfast| and wine and cheese are a must.",
10,Beautiful Hotel with Great Amenities,We have stayed at Hotel Giraffe twice and have loved our stay each time. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable with nice plushy robes to relax in. The hotel offers complimentary wine and cheese each night| which is a lovely touch| and the continental breakfast in the morning is delicious with far more options than you usually see at most hotels. The hotel is also located above a fantastic Italian restaurant and they provide a 20% off voucher for the restaurant. We had a lovely stay and will absolutely return.,
2,Perfect for a weekend getaway!,We recently stayed at Hotel Giraffe for a long weekend getaway and could not have been happier. I wanted to be away from the midtown crowds but with easy access to everything and this location was great. The size of this boutique hotel is perfect and the staff were all very nice and helpful. The continental breakfast and complimentary happy hour every day is a great perk of this hotel and one of the reasons it gets 5 stars. The bed was so comfortable and we found the room size to be perfect for two. Would definitely stay here again and would also like to explore the other hotels in the Library Collection.,
3,Our New York Spring .,We enjoyed our stay. The staff was very kind and attentive. First rate! We especially appreciate Gabby and her partners during breakfast and the wine and cheese hour. Our room was prepared nicely also. The concierge | bellmen...all were so friendly. I'm sorry I don't remember names well| but thanks to all.,
3,Fantastic Hotel Highly Recommend,Stayed for 6 days with my mother. Room was amazing lots of room. Cute little balcony just big enough to see what’s happening outside. Gabriela was the most outstanding staff member to us she made us feel so very welcome each night when we sat down for wine and cheese. She went out of her way to make us feel so good. We thank her for making our stay so memorable!! All staff were so friendly and welcoming! Such a lovely feel this Hotel has us wanting to return in the future. Hotel so clean well maintained. Great location to everything we needed!!,
18,Fantastic experience! ,I can’t say enough good things about this hotel!  A truly perfect experience and very enjoyable stay for me. Attentive and friendly staff. Very comfortable and cozy room. Immaculate premises. Attention to all the details-including complimentary breakfast| WiFi| and daily happy hour.  Will definitely stay here again next time in the city. Job well done Hotel Giraffe! ,
2,Great Stay at Hotel Giraffe,We had a great time| as usual| at Hotel Giraffe.  We were picking up our son from school and just stayed for one night.  The room sizes and bed are great; Gabriela and the happy hour with the excellent pianist were incredible as well as the breakfast the next morning.  The staff are very helpful and even the housekeeping staff are cheerful.  We had a tough time getting a room| so we were happy that there was a cancellation and we were able to get a reservation.  The location is convenient to NYU| and we were even able to walk from Penn Station.,
4,Wonderful stay!,Hotel Giraffe made our stay in NYC very special.  From the complimentary breakfast in the lovely lobby| wine and cheese in the late afternoon| and surprise pastries awaiting us when we returned from dinner| it was a respite from the busy streets of the city. Staff was welcoming and helpful. The hotel is located near the beautiful Madison Sq Park and Flatiron Building.  There are lots of good restaurants in the neighborhood.  We will definitely be back!!,
5,Really close to being perfect,My wife and I stayed for 5 nights and had a thoroughly great stay.   The location is really good - midtown and close to the subway.  We were influence to book here by other reviews| and they weren’t wrong.  We booked a suite| which was a lovely room- not too fussy| simple| perfectly clean and a really nice space. Breakfast was a nice treat; from bagels| toast| boiled eggs| fresh fruit salad| cereals| good coffee etc.| which was included. The wine and cheese at night was also a nice treat. The staff| without exception| were so helpful| polite and friendly.   Even writing this a few days on| it is very hard to fault the hotel.  If fact| we could have spent significantly more to stay in a far more ‘trendy’ hotel| but can’t imagine that we would have had a better stay. Thank you…,
1,AMAZING! Best deal in the City!,This was my second stay on a girls trip weekend. We absolutely LOVED it! The staff was so welcoming and friendly. Anything you need... they are on it. Complimentary Happy Hour and Continental Breakfast were a HUGE bonus.         ,
5,Manhattan-First Time,The Hotel was great. We were put on 2nd Floor and said we would prefer a higher Floor. They began to see what they could; as we waited the Afternoon wine began. So we relaxed with a wine and in a few minutes they brought us our keys on the 6th Floor. The room was nice| big and clean. AC worked great. The morning breakfast and afternoon wine was great. All the servers went out of their way to help. Location at Mid-Manhattan was good.,
2,Wonderful stay,So nice to have the continental breakfast and wine happy hour. Staff was extremely nice and accommodating. A special request was made prior to arrival and we received a call letting us know that it was taken care of even before we got there. Bed was comfortable and room was perfect for us. Small bedroom and small sitting room with bathroom between. The only comment I’d make is that the room was dark even with the lights on and we couldn’t raise the window shade in the sitting room as we looked directly into an office window.  But| the two rooms allowed for some privacy to conduct business.  Overall| a really nice hotel with a rooftop bar and comfortable lobby that are conducive to relaxing in. Enjoyed our stay. ,
7,My favorite hotel in NYC!,This is a wonderful boutique hotel with a warm| friendly and very helpful staff and a great location in the FlatIron district| close to Madison Square Park and many transit options. Rooms are spacious (for NYC) and inviting and many have balconies; and a wide-open light-filled lobby provides an oasis in the middle of NYC.   The Giraffe offers healthy  complimentary breakfast| an excellent evening happy hour| and coffee and tea all day in the lobby| and of course free Wi-Fi. .    A very warm| welcoming property with an outstanding set of employees in every position -- special kudos to Gabriella who hosts most happy hours and many breakfasts!  ,
5,Hotel Giraffe,Great experience at this hotel. Great location and only 3 rooms on each floor. We had a street side room| but it was very quiet(6th floor). Continental + breakfast was great. The staff very friendly. Actually served tables with espresso and food. Great value.,
78,LOVED our stays,We stayed here on the front and back end of our trip to Europe leaving from NYC.  The staff was fantastic| room was clean and comfortable| and more roomy than most. Breakfast was all continental| which was fine for us| but you could choose to eat on the corner in the restaurant they recommend| which is great.  We could walk almost everywhere there| which was also great.  Highly recommend!,
211,5 star boutique hotel,Everything about our stay was amazing. Concierge gave us amazing tips to maximize our NYC experience. Gabriella our barista was the highlight of every day. She anticipated our every need. She remembered our preferences every day whether at Breakfast or at evening wine and cheese reception. She was kind and gracious. Loved having Lattes and cappuccino available every day all day. Rooms were so comfortable and well appointed. Shower was one of the best I’ve ever had in a hotel! ,
3,Another great stay at The Giraffe,Nowhere better to stay in Manhattan if you are looking for excellent customer service| comfy rooms and great location. We are repeat if not frequent visitors to the Giraffe but always get welcomed like old friends by the whole hotel team,
13,Fantastic hotel in NYC,We stayed as a couple at Hotel Giraffe for 5 nights. What a great time we had. The hotel is in a perfect location just a short walk from The Empire State Building and the beautiful Maddison Square Park. The staff were very attentive| nothing too much trouble. The complimentary wine and cheese made for a great social gathering each day from 5-8pm. We would recommend staying at this hotel and hope to return one day.,
1,This Hotel is perfect!,We have stayed several times.  For us| no other NYC hotel has measured up. Great location| convenient to everything but without the chaos of Times Square. Complimentary breakfast that is substantial enough to be your morning meal.  Great complimentary wine and cheese spread in the evening.  Nice size rooms| comfortable beds| robes| slippers| complimentary fruit infused water 24/7. The staff is the best hotel staff we've ever encountered| from Jose and the door J.R. at the desk| and the lovely Gabriella as the hostess - your every need is met.,
4,A 5 star in NY,This hotel exceeded our expectations .. it def 5 star .. great service..location..wine n cheese.. snacks during day..all staff helpful..and friendly..beautiful room w great air cond..all amenities in room.. will def be back,
87,Simply the best,Fabulous from arrival to departure.  Great breakfast and even better breakfast staff.  Very pleasant happy hour with generous offerings and the most wonderful hostess in town.  Extremely comfortable and well maintained room.  Perfect location. What else can I say?  Expensive? Yes| but well worth it. ,
1,Best Hotel in NYC,Service| location| value| quality are the best descriptors of this property.  Rooms are clean| updated| and comfortable.  The lobby is the hotel’s living room. Comfortable couches| chairs and tables are perfect for visiting| working or reading. Included breakfast is outstanding with high quality food| drinks and beverages.  Happy hour is also excellent and the staff is helpful and attentive.,
69,Perfect Boutique Hotel,My husband and I along with 3 other couples spent 4 nights at this lovely hotel. From the minute we arrived until our departure the staff went out of their way to make sure we were enjoying our stay at the hotel. Our queen room with a Juliet balcony was surprisingly roomy with a wonderfully peaceful ambience and very comfortable bed. Included with the room is a very nice breakfast as well as a delightful and extensive Happy Hour. At both of these opportunities we were once again struck by the incredible care of the professional and friendly hotel staff. All four couples agreed Hotel Giraffe is the only place we would consider staying when visiting New York City.,
6,Lovely boutique hotel,My wife and I first stayed at the Hotel Giraffe about 20 years ago after it first opened (or was renovated and re-opened).  We enjoyed the location and the amenities.    20+ years later the hotel’s staff are still extraordinarily service-oriented| quick to respond to requests| and pleasant to engage in conversation.  I’d give 5 stars to the staff and their accommodation of my requests (this is the first hotel in years that accommodated my request to not put fragranced soaps/shampoos into the room and to not use sprays before I arrived).  The facilities themselves are just a bit dated from a design perspective| and for electronics - the room did not have any USB ports for charging devices| and there were no convenient outlets by the side of the bed/endtable to plug in my iPad…,
241,Great location and lovely room,We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights. We had a Juliet balcony and the room was well furnished with comfortable seating as well. Loved that the room had a small fridge. As an Aussie| I love my cups of tea and that was my only complaint that I could not get a decent cup! I did use there coffee/tea maker but it was never hot enough. I ended up buying an electric kettle from Macy’s so that I could have a cup of tea anytime without leaving the room. The continental breakfast was great. My OH brought it back to the room. Evening cheese and wine was also a bonus. Staff were very professional and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.,
16,a gem,first greeting is from very engaging  doormen then to very efficient desk clerks  the hotel is nicely appointed  thev rooms spacious by new york standards   with all the amenities very quite  very comfortable  the hotel has a cozy and friendly feel  providing breakfast and nightly wine and cheese on the house the location is grteat walking distance to macy s eately gramercy tavern  upland and the little prince  a graet overall choice ,
188,Excellent hotel!,We stayed for four nights at this wonderful hotel. We had a deluxe king and our sons a double double room| both had small balconies. The rooms were very comfortable with bottled water and chocolates at turn down. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The best part of this hotel is the complimentary continental breakfast| 24 hour hot drinks| biscuits and cakes and wine and cheese from 5pm until 8pm all of which were excellent. It is in a good location near Madison Square Park and walking distance of most of the main attractions like the Empire State Building and Grand Central Station. Would highly recommend this lovely hotel.,
1,Very nice!!,Wine bar Happy Hour is great! Very pleasant and attentive staff.  Roof deck is very nice too.  Good location for walking to Empire State Building| Flat Iron Building| shopping| bars| Eataly| and there are 2 24 hr pharmacies nearby also.,
1,119,Simply excellent!,From the moment you walk in you enjoy the very friendly service. We stayed here 6 nights and loved it! The room was very clean and we loved our little terrace. Breakfast is service in the lobby area and it gets quite crowded in the morning but still very nice service. We have stayed at other hotels by the library collection but we loved this hotel becuse of the nice room| very nice neighborhood and very friendly and attentive staff.
2,Great hotel,Excellent hotel| nice and clean rooms| great service| very good location near Madison Square Park| breakfast adequate| great restaurants in the area. We will certainly visit the hotel again in the future.,
24,Nice hotel in a good area,We enjoyed the hotel.   Very clean.   GREAT staff.....especially Gabby who worked at the lobby bar/breakfast nook.   She remembered our names and drinks each day and always had a great smile.   Please send our compliments,
2,Comfortable!!,We loved staying at the Giraffe.  The location was great--lots within walking distance and just a block to the nearest subway station. The hotel lobby was a very inviting and comfortable place for me to get some work done while enjoying the continental breakfast each morning.  Also nice to come in after an evening out and grab a snack to take upstairs. The beds were great--bathrooms well-appointed.  A great value for Manhattan!,
5,Great Experience,My wife and I travel to NY frequently and have stayed in hotels all over Manhattan.  We just completed our first stay at Hotel Giraffe and had a fabulous experience.  This hotel is now our go to hotel in the city.  We have already planned return trips in July and September.,
6,My favorite New York hotel!,I love the Hotel Giraffe.    I’ve looked for a quiet personal place to call home when  in New York and I’ve found it!  Yup| I have stopped looking.  Management makes u feel welcome| remembers your name| and caters to your needs| helps you whenever possible.   Everything  about Giraffe is lovely| including the people.  ,
7,What's not to like!!,Great location| friendly attentive staff and clean rooms. We visited NYC just before Easter and booked Hotel Giraffe having read earlier reviews on Trip Advisor. It did not disappoint. To have breakfast included in the rate was very handy with the added bonus of the wine and cheese each evening - a nice touch and a pleasant environment in which to chill out after a day seeing the sights or to have a glass of Prosecco before heading out for the evening. We purchased a Metrocard to explore the city and having the Subway on the doorstep meant a lot of the main sights were easily accessible. Would have no problem highly recommending,
51,My go to NYC hotel. Wonderful!,Great staff who goes out of their way to make your stay great. Happy hour is lovely| and makes for a nice break between daytime business and/or touring and evening activities. Nice location close to subway stops| Madison Square Park| Flatiron| Eately. My only negative is that I’d like for them to have better quality shampoo and conditioner. ,
4,Great hotel| I highly recommend,Great staff| great atmosphere| good value for money| breakfast is decent| the staff is very welcoming| I totally understand why its rank is so high. The only cons I could think of is the noise from the road. It's not terrible but people who are sensitive to noise will notice that,
18,Hotel Giraffe Took Wonderful Care of Us,We spent a week enjoying New York City| and Hotel Giraffe couldn't have done more to make us comfortable.  We booked a classic king which consisted of a sitting room and bedroom.  We had our choice of pillow types| and the hotel provided fresh bottled water and turn-down service each day.  The staff was very helpful and friendly| including the ladies serving the continental breakfast each day.  We loved the boutique feel of the place| and the location was convenient to sights and transportation.  We will definitely recommend this place to friends and will be back soon.,
1,Excellent Boutique hotel,If you want to stay in a boutique hotel that feels like it was in London| then stay here. The staff are extraordinary| the rooms are incredible and the location was perfect. Be ready for wine and cheese in the lobby at night and a wonderful continental breakfast in the morning. ,
73,Practically perfect,Travelled to NY for a long weekend| and splaqshed out on this place due the location| and the fact it looks like a modern NY hotel.  Friendly staff| nice touches ( wine and cheese in evening)| breaffast included and super friendly staff. Also across street from Uplands ( fantastic). Friends rebooted to 2018.  Stay here it's very good,
188,Jewel,One of my favorite hotels I've stayed in. The service was terrific| from the doorman chasing down our Uber| to the staff serving breakfast (better than some restaurants I've been to)..all exceptional.  The rooms are small but very comfortable| I especially loved the electric shade on the patio doors.  Blackout and sound proof splendor. I wish every place I stay was as great as this one. We'll come back to you again the next time we're in the city..thank you for a great stay.,
4,amazing experience,Excellent location| service perfect. The wine tasting is a gift for every guest. The balcony is something special in NY| breakfast also! I really enjoy the time there and strong recommend this Hotel for every one.,
2,Visit to NYC for Birthday celebration,I have stayed at Hotel Giraffe many times and have never had a bad experience. The hotel is a jewel if you like smaller hotels with nice amenities. I love the size of the rooms and bathrooms. The hotel has always been very clean and organized. The lobby/commons area is wonderful as it allows for breakfast and wine/cheese reception| but it is also a relatively large room| walled with windows| comfortable chairs| daily newspapers and the kindest| most efficient staff you would find anywhere. It is so nice to come in off the busy street and relax with a coffee| read a book or chat with friends.  ,
21,Wonderful stay at this great hotel,Booked a week in a room with a balcony and| more importantly| a King size bed at this wonderful hotel. Whilst our visits to NYC are taken up with walking| sightseeing| people watching and eating| this hotel was a great place to ‘come home to’| with complimentary wine and cheese served each afternoon. An excellent ‘Continental Breakfast’ is also available. We will definitely look to stay at Hotel Giraffe again.,
75,Excellent hotel ,I was stay in this hotel for 3 days was really nice and every one it's friendly I fell happy as I am in my home. Differently I will come back  to stay here again.   High recommend if you come to new New York don't miss this hotel.,
43,Return Visit Proved Perfect,This was my second visit to the hotel. The first visit I was alone with my husband| this time we had brought our three daughters. The staff went above and beyond to make sure that we were comfortable. Our adjoining rooms were incredible| with two Juliette balconies and spacious bathrooms. The chocolates at turndown were a delight. We also had the chance to take advantage of the complimentary continental breakfast. Bliss! Alas we never made it to the wine and cheese hour. I am so glad to have gotten to know the wonderful side of Hotel Giraffe. Will visit again!,
1,Lovely experience,This is a lovely place to stay in NYC.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The rooms was great (I got a complimentary upgrade)| clean and comfortable.  What made it exceptional was the service.  Every person I interacted with was kind| polite and helpful.  The wine and cheese in the evening with live music was awesome - I checked in a little after 8pm but they sent me a glass of wine to my room on my first night.  I will definitely stay there again.,
1,Great Exoerience,Everything was wonderful. Staff were all very helpful and very happy to help. The lounge area on the first floor was so nice to be able to use anytime. Great free continental breakfast and free wine and cheese and crackers and vegetables every afternoon| also a lot of fun. Excellent coffee machine so easy to make yourself an espresso or cappuccino or hot water for tea. Look forward to being able to stay again soon.,
1,A winner!,Great property| location| staff and ambiance. This was our second stay at The Giraffe and we will gladly return on our next trip to NYC. Every staff member is friendly and helpful| especially Gabriella who diligently overlooks guests needs both at breakfast and the evening social. The rooms are clean| quiet and comfortable. Complimentary use of the nearby New York Sports Club is a nice bonus even though the gym itself would benefit from some upgrading. ,
2,Loved this place!,We go to NYC often and have for many years| and I think Hotel Giraffe is my favorite hotel.  Honestly| I typically don't even bother to leave a review| but Giraffe exceeded my expectations so much that I want to spread the word.  JR was at the desk when we checked in and was not only super friendly| but helped us coordinate a couple of special requests - with ease. The rooms are very clean and a bit more spacious than most in NY| and many of them have a small balcony - super rare.  They offer generous amenities| most that are not offered by any hotel where we've stayed.  We never met a staff member that was anything less than gracious and cordial| but never in an intrusive way. Thanks Hotel Giraffe - we'll be back!,
4,First Class Service,From the moment we arrived until the moment we left| the staff went out of their way to help my family- from providing extra pillows and blankets to helping us celebrate a birthday with friends in the lobby. They also found my daughters necklace in the room and mailed it back to her. Who does that anymore?! We truly enjoyed our stay and will be back!,
5,Hotel Giraffe far exceeded our expectations. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,I looked hard to find a nice hotel at a reasonable price.  We found rooms in a great location for our plans| that were priced very reasonably for Manhattan.  In the process| we found one of New York City's finest hotels. Hotel Giraffe is not a large hotel.  The staff we recognize you right away and bust their collective tails to make your stay exceptional. The service was simply outstanding|  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  I highly recommend Hotel Giraffe and thank them for a wonderful visit to NYC!,
55,Wonderful hotel,Beautiful hotel.  Complimentary breakfast and cocktails.  Staff really goes out of their way to give everyone special attention...they are very friendly.  Great location with easy subway| cab and Uber access.  Rooms are very nice and feel updated.  It is a smaller hotel| so book early!,
4,Amazing room and great staff ,Can’t get over how great everyone here was! We will for sure be staying again.  This is place has the best rooms and such comfortable beds. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff they helped us so much on2nd shift and even helped us with our bags,
9,Great Location and Great Boutique Gem Hotel,Location is excellent along Park Ave south away from the chaos of Times Square| subway stations close by.  Hotel has a small boutique feel to it. Front Desk was very accommodating in moving us to a higher floor on our request. Two queen beds perfect for family of four.  Breakfast service was excellent and the hotel staff that greeted you at breakfast was positive and very welcoming. Liked idea of having access to water| snacks| and tea 24 hours a day and all complimentary. Would for sure stay at this location and hotel again.,
5,Perfect!,We’ve stayed all over Manhattan with a range of good to bad experiences.  One thing we’ve learned is that when you find a great hotel| stick with it.  And we’re definitely going to stick with Hotel Giraffe.  What a well-run establishment!  Excellent| updated| clean room.  We did 2 upgrades to get a room with a small balcony with a great view of the New York Life building and Park Ave.  Centrally located for comfortable walking distances to many of midtown’s attractions.  But the best part was the hospitality and friendly staff.  They went above and beyond any expectations to make our anniversary special.  We didn’t ask for this treatment| it just feels like it’s part of their core philosophy in how they treat guests.  Very much a positive experience and can’t recommend Hotel…,
8,Great hotel,Just spent 4 nights at this great hotel. Staff are friendly and attentive. Rooms are clean and spacious. Very comfortable beds. Breakfast was good and free refreshments available all day including cheese and wine after 5 pm. Good location| would definitely return.,
13,Pleasant 2 nights at Hotel Giraffe,Friendly welcome| comfortable room. Quick response to minor problem with the bathtub. Continental breakfast (included) had limited| but good choices| especially excellent fruit salad. Pleasant lobby (where breakfast and snacks are served). Would be happy to stay again.,
29,Looking Forward To Our Next Stay,My husband and I just spent a night at Hotel Giraffe. It was an excellent experience from beginning to end. Staff was extremely helpful| pleasant| professional and accommodating. Hotel Giraffe misses nothing in their attention to detail. An easy walk to Union Square farmers market| many great restaurants in Flatiron/Nomad. We highly recommend!  ,
1,Wonderful Stay!,This is a home away from home! Friendly staff| comfortable and spacious rooms| free breakfast| wine and cheese are amenities you can’t get anywhere else in NY at such a great price. Gabriella| the hostess for the wine and cheese happy hour(s) is fantastic and remembers us every time we come! It’s in a great location too. I had originally planned to stay by myself but when the kids and hubby decided to stay at the last minute they upgraded us to an even bigger room. The front desk staff was so understanding and accommodating. ,
2,Lovely Hotel,We recently stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for six consecutive nights.   Pros: Friendly| attentive staff. Great location. Delicious daily breakfast. Yummy nightly wine & cheese reception. Nice selection of snacks and bottled water available throughout the day at no additional cost. Excellent free wi-fi. Spacious| well-appointed rooms.  Cons: No business center -- a laptop and a printer in the middle of the lobby/dining area does NOT qualify as a business center! Passes to a sub-par gym. I really enjoy working out while on vacation| but a facility with 1.5 stars on Yelp does not cut it. This is truly unacceptable from a hotel of this caliber and a major fail. Mediocre Concierge -- the Front Desk staff doubles as the Concierge staff. Their knowledge varied from good to sorely…,
35,Good service and clean,Was happy with this room advto have a balcony in New York was amazing. Highly recommend if you don't want to be in the heart of the action. Staff were great and food outstanding. Security could be better.,
1,We LOVE Hotel Giraffe,My husband and I have stayed at Hotel Giraffe 3 - 4 times.  Since we discovered it| we try to stay here every time we come to New York City.  The location is convenient and surrounded by great restaurants.  We love the wine and cheese happy hour in the lobby every evening and the breakfast in the morning.  The rooms are good size (especially the ones with the sitting areas)| clean and comfy.  The staff is super nice and efficient.  I especially love being serenaded by a live pianist in the lobby as well!,
145,Perfect Place,Perfect in every way| location| amenities| services and staff. Everyone is extremely helpful and efficient| the rooms are large and very well equipped and the service couldn’t be better. The free breakfast is an added bonus. Will definitely be back.,
7,Perfect! The ONLY hotel to stay at in NYC!,After much deliberation about where to stay in NYC| we plumped for Hotel Giraffe. So glad we did| as it was perfect. We wanted to be conveniently located| have great facilities and good service. We got all 3 and more in abundance!  Arrived on 11th March| checked in to a balcony room - spacious| clean and incredibly comfy. Bed and pillows were a delight (i am a tad picky about pillows/mattresses but these were perfect)| lots of storage space| and the bathroom had a great shower. The roof terrace was an added bonus (we will return in summer months when it functions as a rooftop bar) for coffee and fresh air in the morning (alongside the juliet balcony in our room). There is complimentary breakfast in the morning which is a rareity| wine and cheese every evening| and a coffee bar…,
23,Position and Perfect,Now this is a great Hotel. We spent Christmas as a family at this hotel and had such a good time. We had a double room and our adult kids shared a King Suite and used the lounge as a second bedroom which gave them privacy. The staff were great and they serve a continental breakfast every morning which has plenty of food to choose from. Every afternoon about 5pm-7pm they put on an amazing complimentary spread of cheeses and more cheeses| vegies and dip and endless wines from sparkling to reds... This was simply amazing and so good after a day of sightseeing..  We also found it really central with cabs in both directions costing no more than $15.00. The subway is just a block away and goes in both directions and walking distance to many restaurants and bars. We would definitely…,
8,Excellent hotel NYC,Hotel Giraffe is a small and calm hotel in a busy NYC. The location is perfect and the service is super. Free breakfast and afternoon tea and small cheese buffet with wine and drinks. Very friendly employees that creates a very nice atmosphere. Rooms are also spacious and clean.,
120,Perfect stay,We really enjoyed our time here. The staff provide a very high level of service| the rooms are spacious and comfortable with good bathrooms and firm but sleep inducing beds. The hotel is quite small so there are only a few rooms per floor and the rooms seem well soundproofed so you don't hear other guests. There is noise from outside but you are in the middle of Manhattan.  The hotel was very good to us due to a four day delay in arriving following a cancelled flight| they honoured the booked rates and ensured we had a room. Thank you!  The breakfasts are good and hosted in the informal lobby which can get full at busy times| and the nightly wine evenings hosted by Gabriella are wonderful!  Great location for getting anywhere you want to go either by subway or on foot - we found…,
1,Wonderful Hotel,Gabrielle who handled the wine nights was such a warm and wonderful host.  All the STAFF was so helpful and they gave us extra water when we needed.  Loved this HOTEL.  It is in an ideal location out of the hustle and bustle of New York.  Turn down service with soft music an extra bonus.  And chocolates too.  ,
88,A Chic Refuge in Manhattan,A wonderful combination of old world hospitality and art deco ambiance.  Quiet comfort with added touches like complimentary wine and cheese every evening enhanced by soothing jazz on the piano. Breakfast went beyond the usual offerings and snacks are on offer 24/7.,
2,Exceeded expectations,The staff was amazing and so accommodating with our stay| especially since we had to come a day early due to a winter storm. There is complimentary breakfast in the morning| along with complimentary happy hour in the evening! There was no “service fee” tacked on to our stay| which is really hard to find in the city. Room and bathroom was large enough for 4 girlfriends to all stay in comfortably! Would highly recommend staying here| and no doubt we will definitely be back!!!,
50,Great stay| friendly staff,The Hotel Giraffe is a great play to stay. Both the front desk staff and the staff at the breakfast buffet were friendly and helpful. The staffing level was appropriate| so the staff members didn't seem too harried| and were able to provide individual service.  The room is nice| large by NYC standards| and there is a full complement of cable channels.  My 7 yo really loved the breakfast buffet| which has a lot of choices| including fresh fruit and lots of coffee.  The hotel was used by families and business travelers alike. The only things that could be improved are the bathroom doors| which don't close well| and the air vents in the bathrooms| which are a bit small for their purpose.,
26,Warm and friendly hotel near Flatiron,Excellent location for sightseeing very close to a subway station on Park Avenue. Rooms well insulated so no problems with street noise. Well furnished bedrooms of a good size by city standards. Friendly| helpful staff. Continental breakfast included consisting of cereal| fruit| yoghurt and pastries/bagels. Hot drinks available all day in the lobby| although there was also a tea/coffee machine in the room. Excellent cheese and wine reception every evening. All round a lovely hotel where we would be very happy to stay again. Only improvement would be a fan in the bathroom.,
85,Wonderful stay! Great hotel,We States there for 3 days and it WAS just wonderful. The staff is great| good internet and the room is very spacious and comfortable. The free breakfast and happy hour are a plus. Will certainly return.,
1,Excellent Stay in NYC,Enjoyed staying at Hotel Giraffe! The staff was very friendly. The breakfast and happy hour were a real plus! Room was large and very clean. The location was convenient to many places. I look forward to staying here in the future.,
1,Wonderful visit!,Gabrielle| the server for wine and cheese and breakfast was delightful.  She provided excellent service and so friendly.  Gentleman at desk was very helpful with directions.  I will come back and refer other people there.  Great location!!,
1,Beautiful hotel with outstanding staff,It was our first stay at the Hotel Giraffe & we were very pleased with everything.  The facilities were outstanding and the staff went above & beyond to help in any way possible.  The wine & cheese event every evening was terrific.  Fruit| cookies| teas & water always available.  All around terrific hotel.  Would definitely stay again.,
75,Our new place to stay in Manhattan,We loved this place. We had a King Suite| one of the few suites we found that had two separate rooms| one with a functional sleeper sofa. It was a beautiful room| really high ceilings and excellent housekeeping. Great bed| excellent layout with lots of counter space. Room includes a small chiller (didn't seem quite as cold as a refrigerator) and bar nook. The bathroom is really nice| great amenities| instant hot water| again lots of counter space. Good wifi. The complementary continental breakfast and daily wine and cheese (5-8pm) was terrific| and the staff could not be more accommodating. Everyone on the staff at every level was friendly and helpful| they created a great atmosphere| nothing pretentious. As with any big city hotel there is street noise| even on the 8th floor.…,
2,Excellent boutique hotel,The hotel exceeded our expectations.  The room was nice size with a balcony.  Service was impeccable and the hostesses at the breakfast and wine and cheese events were amazing.  Been at many other hotels over the years and this is now one of our favorites.  ,
31,Quiet| lovely hotel,Had a great one-night stay at Hotel Giraffe. We were in a room on the 12th floor and I was shocked at how quiet it was. The bed was very comfortable| room was clean and comfortable and who doesn't love a compimentary wine and cheese reception every evening? All of the staff members were very friendly| too. We will be back!,
10,Comfort in Manhattan,The service level by the staff of Hotel Giraffe sets the bar for any other hotel I've traveled to in the world.  They are attentive| responsive| professional...and most of all...they make you feel like they really want you there.  I highly recommend this haven of comfort in the middle of the crowd of Manhattan.,
1,It could not have been better!,We loved our stay at the Hotel Giraffe!  At check in| the staff was warm and welcoming!  We requested two luggage racks| and they easily accommodated our request.   The room was clean and quiet.   The evening wine and cheese was so lovely along with the background of the piano music. The woman (I forget her name) who served the wine and cheese was fabulous and remembered our wine preferences from the previous night.    The Uptown (sp) restaurant across the street was exceptional as well!   We enjoyed our stay!  ,
7,Fantastic overnight experience,My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for one night to celebrate his birthday. We were there for the Downton Abbey Exhibit and the hotel is a couple of blocks from the subway| which makes it very convenient to travel uptown or downtown. From the moment we walked in from the cold we were greeted so warmly by the staff. We immediately enjoyed some complimentary coffee after we checked in. Our room was very spacious and even had a balcony. The hotel offers wonderful amenities| including a continental breakfast| coffee| snacks and fruits all day. Each evening they offer wine and cheese in the hotel lobby| which we really enjoyed. The hotel even left a bottle of wine with a card in the room wishing my husband a happy birthday. I only wish we had more time there. Can’t wait to…,
1,Exceeded our expectations!,Our room was impeccably clean| surprisingly bigger than most double rooms in a boutique hotel and the staff were friendly and eager to assist us with any request.  We had a corner room and thought it might be noisy but we never heard a thing through the night.  Soundproofing between rooms was excellent as well.  Hotel Giraffe gets two thumbs up from us.  We look forward to our next stay there.,
39,Great value for money,We originally booked the Giraffe Hotel because they has queen sized beds instead of the double beds that seem to be popular in most NY hotels.  We were blown away by the level of service at the hotel.  All the staff were friendly and helpful.  It was also great to have breakfast included| and the staff working at the breakfast bar were very nice.  I also loved the hotel location in the Flat Iron District.  It is a pretty area with lots of great restaurants and strategically located between SOHO and Midtown.  Everything is walkable!  Great value for the money.,
91,Great first stay in NYC,My husband and I stayed at Hotel Giraffe for one night on our way to Switzerland. The room was a great size| and it was a very comfortable stay! Our room had a small balcony. We were able to easily walk to the Empire State Building and take the subway to Central Park. The hotel staff was friendly| knowledgable| and very helpful. We enjoyed the cookies and coffee refreshments. The included breakfast offered an assortment of pastries| bagels| fruit| and cereal. I highly recommend the Hotel Giraffe for a stay in NYC.,
8,A great place to stay,Really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Giraffe. Couldn’t fault the place or the staff. My wife and I spent four nights there as part of her 40th birthday celebrations. We stayed in a classic guestroom with king bed on the 8th floor. The room had plenty of space| the bed was very comfortable and cleaned and made up every day.  The continental breakfast was fine for us and the afternoon cheese and wine party with Gabriella was fantastic. We found the reception staff to be very helpful and amenable throughout our stay. The location on Park Avenue South was excellent. Subway stations within easy reach on the green line at 23rd and 28th street and the yellow line at Maddison Square Park on 23rd street. This gave easy access up town and downtown| however many attractions are within easy…,
111,Great stay.,As travel/lifestyle instagrammers| we really enjoyed staying there. The room are clean and really spacious compare to other hotels we’ve been to and this is for us really appreciated as we do have a lot of suitcases while traveling for our photo sessions. The staff is really nice and the hotel is well located| close to every major sightseeing in NYC. We loved the balcony in our room with the view on Park Avenue| a pleasant surprise. We appreciated the complimentary drinks and snacks all day at the lounge area| a real plus for travelers. We also recommend you to try the restaurant “Breads & Tulips” connected to the hotel| delicious Italian restaurant with delicious cocktails. All in all| our stay was great and we will be back.,
4,Great NYC Hotel,Large rooms by NYC standards| nicely renovated and very clean| great location| great service.  Spent a very enjoyable three nights at the Giraffe| and would definitely return.  The free continental breakfast and afternoon wine/cheese hour is a great feature.,
3,Best Value,I love this hotel.  Reasonable prices for spacious| immaculately kept rooms| incredibly attentive and professional staff make this the only place I’ll stay in NYC.  And I am VERY picky!  The complimentary breakfast and cocktail HOURS (!) are fantastic.,
33,Wonderful hotel,My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and stayed in a balcony king room. From the moment we checked in we felt so relaxed. It's a lovely hotel in an excellent location. It's a short walk to all the main attractions. The hotel is situated 2 streets away from the Flat Iron building. The staff in the hotel are so friendly. Breakfast is delicious with plenty of choice from cereal| fruit| yoghurts| bread and pastries. Hot drinks and biscuits are available all day. Between 5-8pm the hotel provides cheese and biscuits with wine. It's a lovely way to unwind at the end of a busy day. Bottles of water are provided each day in your room. The rooms are very spacious with views along Park Avenue South. The bed is huge and very comfy| you can hear the traffic on the road but it's to be…,
1,Great for a Girls' Weekender,My daughters and granddaughter traveled with me to the Big Apple and were impressed by our accommodations at Hotel Giraffe.  What a great introduction for us to the best that New York has to offer.  I hope to bring my husband with me the next time I visit.,
1,Second home,Real (not plastic) plants in the room| impeccably clean| satisfying breakfast and happy hour| and the friendliest staff; all combine to make it a second home. The overnight valet parking was very convenient. ,
2,Dedicated staff,The hotel is very comfortable with excellent rooms fitted out to a high standard. What sets this hotel apart are the professional staff at every level. My wife and I stayed for 8 nights and we were treated every moment with curtesy| friendliness and wholly welcome. We have stayed before and it has not changed and hopefully never will. We will be back.,
15,Great hotel!!,This hotel was perfect for a long weekend trip (Fri to Mon)!  The staff were fab| from the doormen| to the staff at the front desk to the ladies serving breakfast and Gabriella hosting the wine and cheese evening - all were friendly| helpful and welcoming.  The room was amazing| two large beds| plenty of storage space and room and a balcony overlooking the corner of 28th and Park Ave. The housekeeping did an amazing job and I really appreciated the turn down service in the evenings.  The space in the lobby is great for breakfast and the evening wine reception| and is a lovely spot to chill out with a coffee and a pastry after coming in from walking all over town. I've stayed in numerous hotels in New York over the past 10 years and this has been the best hotel and stay! I will…,
2,Perfect location and great hotel!,Perfect location and great hotel! Very nice staff. Breakfast simple but good| all you need really and excellent coffee! Rooms are clean and spacious and really nice if you hace the small balcony for the views and energy from the city. Overall excellent stay!,
62,Hidden Gem,I stayed one night and was very pleasantly surprised. The staff was wonderful and even blocked a specific type of room for me. The welcome was fantastic. The room was clean and well appointed. The electric shade was a nice touch. I did not find the room noisy although there was obviously street noise. Nice breakfast buffet and great restaurants close by.  The only negative was a smell of perhaps a scent in the room that was unnecessary. I don’t understand why hotels need that!!,
7,gem of a hotel,Perfect weekend in NYC. Staff at The Giraffe were all friendly| over the top helpful| and all the while extremely professional. They took care of dinner reservations and happen to be directly across the street from one of the hot spots for dining| Upland| which was delicious.,
1,Lovely Stay,This is our second stay at the Hotel Giraffe and it did not disappoint.  The room was tastefully decorated and spotless with extremely comfortable beds. The desk clerks could not have been more pleasant and the continental breakfast had everything you could ask for as well as wonderful servers to assist you with anything you needed. Can't wait for our next girls trip-no question we'll stay here again!,
28,Great hotel - amazing service,I arrived  really early and just wanted to check my luggage but they had a room and checked me in which was fantastic- the service here is so lovely from the front desk |to the breakfast staff to the cocktail hour . The rooms are spotless and very comfortable. I love this hotel and will return again and again . Thank you all the staff at the Giraffe ,
3,A wonderful evening in New York,Recently we were able to get away for a weekend in New York and our decision to stay at Hotel Giraffe was a great first decision. Everyone on staff was very friendly and attentive. The fresh fruit out at all times was a great perk. The breakfast was just what we needed| to get a quick bite and get on our way. We did not partake in the wine and cheese| but the people who were seemed to be enjoying themselves. We decided instead to head to the restaurant (Bread & Tulips) we both enjoyed our dinner and were happy to be able to make the most of a surprise snow storm. ,
114,Another great stay,Great boutique style hotel (only 72 rooms) with no more than 7 rooms/floor gives the feeling of exclusivity.  Generous breakfast buffet in warm and welcoming main lobby area| 24/7 access to espresso/coffee/tea/fruit/cookies and outstanding wine/cheese reception all included in the more than reasonable pricing for NYC.  Rooms not at all typical of Manhattan in that they are spacious| bright| well-appointed and quiet.  Location at Park/26th may not be prime but nothing is far and Uber or public transit make everything readily accessible - absolutely NOT a hindrance.  My wife forgot a small jewelry pouch with the staff kindly found and couriered back to us at no charge - outstanding service!,
53,Friendly welcoming hotel,Ideal location. Close to Madison Square Gardens and Empire State. Could walk to most places from here. The staff were very welcoming and at 6pm every evening offered you cheese and wine while listening to a pianist. Rooms were a good size and the bed was very comfy. Goos breakfast ad free wifi,
1,Another great stay| the staff is excellent,This was our second time staying here| and the hotel and their staff did not disappoint! Nick at the front desk took great care of us and our needs before and during our stay. We were celebrating our 20th anniversary| when we walked into our room there was a hand written card wishing us a happy anniversary and a bottle of wine| really nice!! We stayed in a king suite again| which we loved| it's plenty big for 2 people| but you could easily sleep 3 or 4. There is a sitting area with a couch that folds into a bed| 2 chairs with a coffee table and a flat screen TV and a small refrigerator. The room was always immaculately clean when we returned each day| the maids do a great job. The also had nightly turndown service| the staff turns on music and leaves chocolates next to the bed|…,
9,OUTSTANDING HOTEL 5 STAR LEVEL SERVICE,There's not much to say that other reviewer's haven't but this is a fantastic little boutique hotel in NYC. I have only stayed at a luxury 5 star resort twice in my life (once at the Ritz and once at the 4 Seasons) and the level of service at Hotel Giraffe is at the 5 star level. Anytime you need anything| someone is right there to help you.  They have free breakfast every morning (fruit| cereal| pastries). The coffee is fantastic and strong! They also have an espresso machine if you want an espresso based drink! They have a 5PM wine and cheese reception every night which is also free! It was perfect if you just need a quick snack to hold you over until dinner.  My room was very nice and CLEAN! Nothing was wrong with my room| it was perfect. Ok| there was no fan in the bathroom.…,
4,Great Experience,Hotel Giraffe is a gem in the middle of Manhattan.  Super helpful and friendly staff combine with well pointed rooms and an excellent breakfast.  You are my go to establishment for both pleasure and business.  ,
3,Amazing stay at Hotel Giraffe,Staff was amazing. I am from New York and felt as though I was on vacation. Good location| very clean| and reasonable prices. Would definitely stay there again! Great that they have valet parking as well. ,
4,NYC Wedding Shopping Trip,"We booked Hotel Giraffe for 2 nights - wish we would have stayed longer!  2 couples| 2 rooms.  We arrived early| 1:30| hoping they could store our luggage| and were pleasantly surprised to learn one of the rooms could be checked in to immediately.  They asked us for our cell numbers so they could call us as soon as the other room was ready!  Already off to a great start.   The manager reception was great - wines| including sparkling wines| and a great variety of cheeses| crackers| and vegetables with live music!  The hostess was exceptional!  Offered table service and kept our glasses and plates full.  The breakfast was equally delicious - lots of fresh fruit| pastries| cereals| coffees and tea - much more than the usual ""continental"" breakfast.    We really appreciated the…",
8,Jan Stay,Love this hotel and have been there quite a few times.  This time was a night of bitter cold in NYC and the room was cold but it is a luxurious room and the service is always excellent as well as the wine and snacks at happy hour.,
2,A fabulous| welcoming hotel.,The hotel is so welcoming| the staff are lovely| someone there to open the door for you and wish you a good day when you leave. We knew there was a complimentary breakfast and wine| cheese and biscuits between 5-8pm but we didn't expect to have complimentary refreshments whatever time of day we went back to the hotel. There is coffee and tea to help yourself to along with pastries and biscuits. There is also iced lemon water| apples and bananas available at all times. I've never been to a hotel where so much is available to make your stay more comfortable. It made it a very welcoming and relaxing place to get back to after a day of sightseeing. The rooms were lovely and we slept really well| especially with the blackout blind. If you've forgotten anything| again the hotel…,
35,Stylish retreat in the city,Stayed with my son and daughter in a Queen room with balcony and Balcony King Suite. Both were a good size| comfortable beds and large bathrooms with robes| good showers and lovely products. Rooms have blackout blinds and soundproofing| so we slept extremely well. Breakfast is a buffet in the elegant lobby| with lovely fruit| bagels| pastries and cereal. A brilliant start to the day. In the evening we relaxed with the complimentary wine and cheese and on one evening someone played cool jazz on the piano.  The hotel restaurant is not a typical bland hotel restaurant| but has its own character and really good pizza and pasta. As hotel guests we had a 20% discount and the prices are really reasonable. This is a lovely hotel| well situated close to the Flatiron and the Maths Museum;…,
1,Amazing,such a nice oasis in nyc. no pomp - all value and beautiful. we had a suite that was super for relaxation. no noise. great location. and nice restaurant across the street. I will definitely stay here again. also| in walking distance to uptown and downtown.,
4,Perfect Stay,Really convenient location and VERY helpful staff. We really enjoyed the quiet location and the complimentary breakfast and wine and cheese. It's a really convenient location to access all of Manhattan| and a nice place to come home to at night. Great restaurants all around. ,
60,Excellent as advertised ,We stayed at the hotel giraffe for one night on a Friday after taking in dinner and a show. The room was spacious|  ultra clean| excellently appointed| with comfort in all areas. The complimentary continental breakfast was very good and the service top notch. I will most definitely be returning in the future and highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in manhatten. ,
5,Half Term Break,Stayed at Hotel Giraffe for 4 nights on our first trip to New York. Glad we did! Super hotel in a great location with lovely friendly staff. Room was a good size with all amenities; bed was lovely and comfy. Service throughout the hotel was lovely and friendly (particularly at the free breakfast). Happy to recommend.,
100,Wonderfull three night stay.,After searching for days for the most suitable hotel in New York which means a small hotel with an atmosphere I found this hotel and I had a very good feeling  when booking|We are very happy about this hotel| first the room was immaculate and spotless and very big. Everything I asked for was respected and the breakfast was good| Arletty was very kind and so was Johanna . Nothing to complain about| We are delighted about this hotel.and if we can| we would come back,
105,A very nice hotel in NY,There are many good things to say about this hotel. First| the location is super convenient| close to several subway lines| and not in times square as so many similar hotels tend to be. Second| the rooms are nice -- not especially fancy or creative| and a bit old fashioned in their style| but in fact quite newly done| and very comfortable and well equipped. Last and most importantly| the hospitality in the lobby is a big plus. A generous continental breakfast in the morning| evening drinks and snacks| etc -- that's a really nice touch and a change from impersonal NYC hotels. I'll be back.  ,
25,Great hotel in NYC,Hotel Giraffe has a great central location and comfortable rooms. The hotel has a plentiful continental breakfast| wine and cheese in the evening| and very hospitable staff - will now be my go-to place to stay in NYC!,
3,Excellent hotel| excellent value,We just came back from a three-night stay at the Hotel Giraffe and all I can do is echo all of the five-star reviews here.  The hotel is lovely and comfortable| the location is terrific| and the service is impeccable.  The evening reception is lovely| as is the breakfast.  The turndown service is attentive and the front desk staff excellent.  I can't make anything but positive comments.  If we return to NYC soon| we will definitely stay here again.,
2,“Beautiful” in NYC.,We came to NYC to see “Beautiful” and we were so happy to be back at Hotel Giraffe!   It’s like home in a way.  Comfortable| clean and so pretty! The front desk and lobby have the friendliest staff.  It’s so nice to always have the lemon water and snacks available as well as cappuccino. And the wine and cheese hour and breakfast are great. The lobby is so welcoming all the time.  Very relaxing stay!!  We’ll be back for our next show. ,
5,Wonderful experience - again!,Last week| we returned for our third annual visit to Hotel Giraffe. Everything about our visit was superb.  The staff is incredibly helpful especially Gabriella| who hosts the evening wine and cheese reception and Jose| the doorman.  Meeting up with each of them is like renewing an old acquaintanceship.  The location of the hotel is great.  Anyone interested in architecture will have a feast to explore.  We had a delightful lunch in the hotel restaurant| Bread & Tulip.  We're already looking forward to our next visit.,
35,A gem in the heart of New York,This boutique hotel was perfect for us. It is well situated within walking distance to 5th avenue and Times Square but in a quieter area to ensure a good nights sleep. The staff went out of there way to make our stay comfortable. Loved this hotel and would highly recommend it.,
37,Good location and friendly service,Picked this based on reviews and wanting a different location from previous trip. Good room for a family and not too noisy given the on street location. Comfy beds. Wine and cheese is a must with very friendly and helpful service from Gabriela. Breakfast is basic but sufficient and again nice service from the ladies helping with toast coffee etc. Central location helps get to many places easily by foot subway isn’t too far away for longer trips. All in a good choice at a reasonable price for this city  ,
61,Great hotel,My wife and I recently spent five nights at HotelGiraffe. We stayed on the 11th floor and had a great view from the balcony. The room was comfortable| bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was lovely with every possible convenience. Coffee making facilities were in the room with a cartridge type coffee maker. The buffet breakfast was perfect to set up for the day and we didn’t need anything else until lunchtime. On one evening we attended the wine and cheese function| It was a great evening with a good selection of cheeses. One member of staff to note was Gabriella| she could not do enough for us and appeared to work at both breakfast and the wine and cheese evening. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel for couples. It is located pretty centrally for both uptown and…,
81,Wonderful stay,I have stayed here many times and love coming back. The staff here go above and beyond. Jose at the front door| JR at the check in and Gabby at Happy Hour/Breakfast are all so welcoming and kind. I love staying here. The location is perfect and rooms are large by NY standards. I highly recommend this hotel!,
3,Warm your heart,I love this hotel.  Super nice| comfy rooms| very quiet and the staff is amazing.  Thank you Hotel Giraffe; I'll be back! Breakfasts are nice and the piano in the lobby playing during evening wine and cheese  snack hospitality are wonderful.,
2,Hotel stay,Another hotel lost my reservation so I called Hotel Giraffe at 7pm and they gave me a room at a great rate !!  There was a wonderful cheese & wine at night and expresso in the morning - LOVE THIS PLACE !!,
10,Giraffe Love,We have stayed at the Giraffe many times and absolutely love it. We go annually with a bunch of friends who all stay there as well| and all of us feel the same way. The staff are friendly| helpful| efficient. And the accommodations are wonderful. We shall return!,
3,This is where to stay in NYC,This will be our new home away from home in NYC.  The rooms are larger than normal and the hotel staff are very warm and welcoming.  The self-serve breakfast had a lot of options.  The free happy hour was great!  The lobby is always full of patrons and has a festive atmosphere.  The wine is good and the appetizers are also good - cheese| crackers| olives| nuts| veggies and dip.  Gabriella is often serving and she is energetic| with a wonderful smile and demeanor.  Somehow she serves the whole crowded room effortlessly.  The only thing I was shocked about was that a majority of the tables ate free food and drink for two hours and did not tip!!! ,
38,charming| clean and quiet,Live here in the city but had a few nights mid-move that required hotel stays -- this was the star of the lot.   Classy without being stuffy;   wonderfully comfortable beds| quiet rooms| very friendly staff.  breakfast snacks and hors d'oeuvres in the lobby.   For out of towners convenient easily accessed location without being in the middle of the madness of more touristy neighborhoods.,
1,unique boutique, Well appointed suite and room| comfy mattress and pillows.  Breakfast fresh| good.  Only down| no available hot water pot for early morning tea before heading down to food area.  Waitstaff competent and friendly.  ,
1,One of my Favorites,They have big rooms for New York City.  I love that they have coffee and tea available all day!  I've stayed here several times and the people are friendly and accommodating.  The location is very convenient and close to subway stops and many good restaurants.,
2,Great location and excellent staff,We stayed at The Giraffe for a long weekend. Hotel was extremely friendly and the location on 26th was very convenient. Breakfast was limited but that did not matter as we found the best breakfast in NYC according to the locals directly opposite| restaurant called Upland. Can’t beat it! We walked everywhere from the hotel| including Battery Park to get the Statue of Liberty Ferry. It was a beautiful winter’s day and the walk took an hour and we saw so much more than we would have done in a cab.,
1,Excellant Hotel Giraffe. I would recomend this hotel to everyone!,Gabriella is fantastic. She was always downstairs greeting us in the morning and at night. She made our trip very special. She always had a smile and was so attentive and always remembered our names. Gabriella definitely made our trip very special. All of the people were nice at Hotel Giraffe in NY.  We hope to be back soon to visit our son and wife and our new grand baby girl. We will definitely stay with yall. ,
1,Girls Trip,My 11 yo daughter and I spent 4 nights in a king suite at Hotel Giraffe.  We LOVED it and had the best time in NYC.  All the staff are so kind and so helpful.  They remembered how we took our coffee and that my daughter liked hot chocolate and would serve it to us each day.  The location was perfect and so close to Eataly and other restaurants| shopping and to both shows we went to: Blue Man and Stomp.  We can't wait to stay here again!,
2,A Great Hotel,Very professional and friendly service.  The rooms were beautiful and clean.  The late afternoon happy hour with wine and cheese| etc.| was delightful.  Breakfast was also very good.   The location was perfect.,
1,Sandy,Thus has been our 7th midwinter nyc break. It keeps getting better. The lobby is very homey yet sophisticated| perfect to hang out reading the paper in the morning or relaxing after a bustling day in the city| sipping wine and preparing for an exciting evening out. Love this place,
31,Just about Perfect 😊,We stayed here over Christmas & New Year.  The room was quiet| clean and really convenient to Times Square etc.  The staff were really great.  Helpful and never intrusive   The complimentary wine & cheese was much better than expected.  Many thanks to the lady who presented the cheeses  The breakfast was good| not great though.  We’ll be back,
1,The best.,I can't think of anything negative about this hotel. The room was terrific| the service was excellent| the people were super| the whole establishment was great.  I don't have enough superlatives to describe the hotel.  ,
3,Top rate hotel,We spent our first wedding anniversary here and we could not have had a better experience. The bedrooms are wonderful| the atmosphere fantastic with the daily cheese and wine| and the breakfasts delightful. ,
1,Love to stay at the Hotel Giraffe,WE always stay at the Giraffe and love the people that work there| the breakfast in the morning and wine and cheese in the afternoon.  Jose the door man has been there since the hotel opened and he always remembers us.,
20,Great| quiet| comfortable hotel,I love staying at this hotel when I stay in NYC. It has an overall warm| cozy vibe but is spacious compared to most hotels in the city. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are quiet and full of light. The staff is very friendly| engaged| competent and service-oriented. It's laid back and not too trendy but is also modern and clean. ,
4,Wonderful stay at the Giraffe Hotel,I stayed at the Giraffe Hotel in December 2017.  The entire experience was wonderful!  The staff were helpful and kind.  The happy hour nibbles and champagne were great.  I loved the bedding.  The location for New York is perfect.  I will definitely return!!!,
37,Best Hotel in NYC,There is no better place to stay in New York. The Giraffe is conveniently located near subway stations| and it's an easy walk from Penn Station and Grand Central Station. The rooms are clean| spacious| and comfortable. The hotel provides great value| especially if you take advantage of the free Continental breakfast and daily Wine & Cheese hours. There are great restaurants nearby| and the neighborhood is safe. The best thing about the Giraffe| though| is the welcoming friendliness of the staff. They gladly hail cabs| haul suitcases| and provide directions and recommendations. Gabriella| the Wine & Cheese hostess is a treasure. Not only does she remember you and your visits| but she ensures that you have an enjoyable| relaxing time. ,
319,A great find in mid-town,When ever we travel to New York we expect to pay high prices for a room without getting many amenities. Hotel Giraffe turned out to be very different. The staff was great and friendly. The room was very large compared to most New York hotels. It even had a balcony (a bit chilly for us to spend any time using it). The area that we did use the most was the lobby area. This became our hub. The hotel offers a wonderful continental breakfast each morning. Then again in the evening where the hotel hosts a wine and cheese gathering. And when you got in late in the evening there was always tea/coffee and cookies available. We could not have found a more warm| friendly and inviting place to stay.,
8,The Giraffe is a Gem!,This boutique hotel is a quiet respite in a wonderful location in NYC. We have stayed several times and each time the staff has surpassed our expectations with their hospitality and service. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The added bonus of all-day access to a very cozy lobby with fruit water and light snacks is great. This time our room was not ready when we arrived due to a repair that was being made and the staff recommended a wonderful nearby restaurant and offered us a bottle of wine when the room was ready. Breakfast is fresh and the coffee was delicious.  Love this place! ,
1,Wonderful hotel and great workers!,I stayed here for 9 days while a took a course. Everyone was amazing. Gabby was great during breakfast and happy hour. Felt like second home. NY sports club passes for free was a plus! Turn down service was also appreciated.,
9,Love the giraffe,We have stayed at this property several times. The staff is wonderful| the property is first rate and location is terrific. It feels more like a guest house or bed and breakfast rather than a cold hotel. ,
1,A+ Hotel,Staff was exceptional from start to finish. Doormen| breakfast staff| registration| etc were very helpful and accommodating. Delicious breakfast with fresh fruit| bagels| hard boiled eggs| etc. Very clean rooms with comfortable beds. Even provide umbrellas for your convenience on a rainy day. Will definitely stay here next time I am in NYC ,
5,Location| Amenities and Service,Great location. Pleasant| well-appointed| clean and quiet room. Comfortable lobby| with excellent included breakfast and happy hour selections; with coffee all day. Best of all| though| was the service| first-rate in every way. ,
33,Best NYC hotel experience,Great value for a very large| clean| well appointed room. Loved the large window/door--great light! Friendly staff. Enjoyed the complimentary cocktail hour and breakfast--lots of tasty options. This is the perfect neighborhood as a home base while you explore the city!,
2,Perfect Place for a Winter Getaway,In a word - perfect.  Clean| friendly| accommodating.  Breakfast and happy hour included makes it an amazing bargain.  Nice linens| towels| and shampoos| etc. Staff was always helpful and welcoming| Truly enjoyed our stay. ,
132,Great NYC Hotel,I hesitate to Wote a review of the Giraffe Hotel. I am afraid it will get too popular and not be available on our future visits to NYC.  The hotel was perfect. We had a wonderful corner room on the 9th floor overlooking Park Avenue and 26th Street. The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. The room price includes a very nice continental breakfast. There is also twice daily housekeeping service.  The location is great. Close access to subways| dining and shopping.  Highly recommend the Giraffe Hotel.,
77,Traveled to NYC to see some Broadway shows,Everyone was so warm.  Lovely Breakfast.  Wonderful Happy Hour.  Great Location.  Our rooms was just right for a girls weekend.  One evening we ate at the restaurant in the hotel.  It was perfect after travelling.  Definitely would stay here again and again.,
45,This is the go-to place for a Manhattan get away.,The Hotel Giraffe provided us with a completely satisfactory stay. The staff is wonderful| remembering us immediately after our first encounter. The breakfast and cocktail hours are special in that lovely| comfortable lobby. This will be our go-to hotel in Manhattan from now on...unless we decide to try one of the sister hotels. PS Restaurant Bread and Tulips downstairs is outstanding in every way.,
3,Great bang for your buck,Clean and well-appointed room with balcony door that opened. Friendly and attentive but not overbearing staff. Included contininental breakfast and wine & cheese happy hours every night. Arranged airport transport for me| and answered all other emailed/telephone questions promptly. And not at a “luxury” price point. Really a great find| we enjoyed our stay very much!,
7,great location in the Flatiron district,My 10 y.o. son and I stayed there and I am really happy with the choice. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful and the location is convenient around 26th street. Morning breakfast is good| the hotel is very clean| and the room was good-sized for Manhattan. With turn-down service and a good view of NY I could not have wished for more.,
4,An overall wonderful experience.,The inclusive breakfast and happy hour were a step above.   Service solicits and friendly.   High ceilings in rooms and balconies.  Central location with easy access to midtown and downtown.  Boutique size hotel so is quiet.,
3,Love this hotel,We had a wonderful experience staying at the Hotel Giraffe. We especially enjoyed the complimentary wine and cheese  and all day coffee/tea availability.Our room was very nice and very soundproof. The lobby is very nice  to hang out in after a day of shopping /sightseeing.All the staff were very friendly and accommodating.We will definitely be staying here on our next visit!,
214,Friendly  Cozy,Very nice hotel with very friendly and helpful staff.  My room| although a little small (typical of many New York City hotels) was very nice| clean and comfortable and quiet| even though I was only on the second floor facing Park Avenue.  My only complaint was that the room lighting was too dim| but housekeeping brought me an extra desk lamp which allowed me to do the work I needed to do.  I will return to this hotel.  A continental breakfast is included along with a happy hour glass of wine.  Very nice!,
76,Quick jaunt,Just a quick winter visit into the city for a special exhibition.  As always| the rooms and the staff at the Giraffe are warm and welcoming.  The continental breakfast makes everything so easy starting the day.,
22,A Great Two Night Stay in Manhattan,My wife and I stayed for two nights at the Hotel Giraffe. Above all else the service was outstanding. From the Bellman| to the wine & cheese attendants (Arlety and Gabriela) to JR in the front desk they were all super attentive. Our mini suite was very comfortable and the hotel amenities|including the continental breakfast and afternoon wine and cheese were excellent considering the price. The location is also very good.,
12,FUNCTIONAL| QUIET AND CENTRAL| BUT NOT VERY LUXURIOUS,We stayed for 8 nights in a very nice suite on the 7th floor. The suite was spacious and quiet| but felt like a 3-star business room rather than anything more cosy| modern| boutique or luxurious. The hotel's position on Park Ave is perfect and the staff are friendly. Housekeeping was always good and the upkeep of the bathroom every day was excellent.  Here are the main drawbacks at Hotel Giraffe:- 1) Piped music from dawn till dusk in the lobby - who needs cheesy radio pop music playing all day? This is not for us - we'd rather talk quietly! This pretty much put us off ever going to breakfast in the lobby or enjoying the cheese and wine on offer at cocktail hour. 2) The breakfast looked very meagre - I know it's free| but they didn't even offer any granola! If you want a nice|…,
1,Great hotel,Perfect location| big spacious bedroom with balcony| comfortable| clean|  very friendly staff and great breakfast and wine evenings. Could not fault anything. We Definitely recommend a stay here it was every thing we wanted an more ,
20,Well-placed excellence,The Giraffe is a couple of blocks from the subway giving easy access to both uptown and downtown locations. This small hotel is in easy walking distance of good restaurants. The staff| on the door| behind the desk| serving evening wine and cheese and morning breakfast| maintenance and cleaning| are all helpful| cheerful and brilliant. The rooms are quiet| clean and the beds very comfortable. Five stars.,
1,Wonderful time!,We spent two nights with them and couldn’t have been happier.  Excellent service and beautiful room. Would definitely go back again.  Cheese and wine was very enjoyable and really tasty. Thank you Hotel Giraffe!,
5,Top notch in every way!,We loved every moment. Staff is exceptional| they go out of their way to make you feel welcome. This was our second visit and we will be back. Lovely wine and cheese reception and breakfast was very good as well. ,
2,Another great stay.,Second time at the Giraffe and it continues to be a great choice. Had friends with us this time| first time in NY| and they really enjoyed their stay as well. Always great to unwind or start the evening with eh wine and cheese. Love the service at breakfast. Thanks.,
2,Love the Giraffe,Always my favorite place to stay in NYC. I love the european flair at breakfast and the all day cappuccinos. The rooms are spacious and updated| the staff is friendly and attentive and the location is perfect for uptown or downtown.  We always check the Giraffe first when we know we'll be in the City.,
1,Great hotel in NYC,No coffee makers in room unless you request one AND one is available| but otherwise awesome.  Free excellent breakfast| free cocktails & wine and cheese & crackers nightly. Great staff| great location| great value! ,
47,Don't pass this one up...,Full disclosure - this was my first stay in NYC| HOWEVER I have been an international traveler for over 20 years| so I know something about hotels.  There are hundreds of hotel options in Manhattan| but I can't imagine any matching the comfort| coziness| friendliness| and service of the Hotel Giraffe.  They made us immediately at home (with a bottle of bubbly as it was our honeymoon)| and took great care of us our entire stay.  The location was superb and put us close to our destinations| from Central Park to Katz's Deli.  We WILL be back| and miss it already...,
33,Just a wonderful hotel,We had booked this hotel following TripAdvisor reviews to start off my 50th birthday celebrations. i knew i wanted somewhere not too busy and certainly not in Times Square. I also liked the feedback about the staff.     Our original dates were 27th December until the 4th January. However the weatherbomb hit on the 4th January and our flights were cancelled so we ended up staying for a further 5 nights. I therefore do feel that after almost 2 weeks in this hotel| i can give an honest review and it was perfect.   The beds were comfortable| the rooms were clean| the complementary breakfast was great and we always got a table. The staff were amazing| both on the front desk| on the door and the breakfast staff and of course the wonderful Gabriela who ran my favourite bit of the day -…,
84,The only place I will be staying in NYC from now on,This hotel is a true gem. I have stayed at many places in NYC| from the Waldorf to the Parker Meridien to the Westins etc| and this is the only place I will stay from now on. You really do get the best of a luxury hotel at a decent price. The staff are ALL extremely nice and helpful- they go out of their way to help the customers| from chasing a cab down in the freezing rain to bringing up hot chocolate. There is a free breakfast (continental) and free wine and delicious cheese at night| and there is all-day access to coffee| hot chocolate| apples| etc. The room was much larger than most boutique hotels| the shower water was wonderfully hot| and the rooms have thick walls and a quiet atmosphere. There is even a nice balcony we did not use because it was so cold. I honestly felt…,
2,Exceeded expectations,We had a wonderful but brief stay at the Hotel Giraffe. The staff were extremely helpful. The room was spacious and clean. Actually can't think of anything wrong with it| we would definitely stay there again. ,
2,Our Favorite Hotel,We have gone to The Giraffe Hotel during Christmas week for the past 4 years.  The staff is extraordinary in their service and their concern for the guests.  Gabriella and JR and all the staff go above and beyond.  We have already booked for 2018!  It wouldn’t be Christmas without our stay at the Giraffe.,
13,An excellent stay!!! Not one negative.,Highly recommended.  A lovely respite in a busy city.  All of the details were excellent.    Front desk staff - all staff! - were knowledgeable| helpful and friendly.  Perfect restaurant recommendations for spots all over Manhattan.  Room was lovely with nicely thought-out| high-end details - lots of wood| high ceilings| mirrors| amenities.  We found a bottle of wine and handwritten note acknowledging our celebration when we arrived in the room. Room basics were good| too - comfortable bed| quiet| plenty of lighting| nice towels| hot shower (with high shower head!)  Breakfast was perfect. Continental| but just right and the staff was exceptional.  I loved being able to grab some snacks or cold water or coffee whenever we wanted. We were exhausted on our second night and opted to…,
1,Cozy City Hotel,Giraffe is conveniently located in midtown Manhattan with easy access to metro and in manageable walking distance to Time Square and main 5th Avenue locations (e.g. Empire State Building). Very friendly and helpful staff. Tea| coffee| cookies free around the clock. No hidden costs. Rooms are well laid-out| cozy| functional and decently spacey.,
6,Fabulous NYC stay!,Our family stayed st Hotel Giraffe for 5 nights| this property was excellent the rooms spotlessly clean| drinks and nibbles and breakfast fantastic.  Perfect stay| great location| wonderful staff from arrival to departure| we will return and being travel agents ourselves highly recommend this hotel.,
68,Warm| welcoming and wonderful!,From the very first email enquiry (and the many subsequent ones!) I knew that our stay at Hotel Giraffe over Christmas was going to be great. Gaby answered each question in detail and always in a friendly manner| going the extra mile in sending a comprehensive list of Christmas restaurant suggestions| options for transport and securing us the best possible deal for our 6-nights of accommodation. Once we arrived we could see that all staff members had the same efficient and friendly work ethic and it made for a fabulous time. We very much appreciated our daughter's 21st birthday being acknowledged| as well as the nightly turn down service| evening cheese and wine| all day coffee and pastries and continental breakfast. Our room was clean and quiet and catered well for 3 with a…,
1,Excellent hotel. Want to go back!,Recently stayed 1 night for 50th birthday celebration.  Bottle of wine and chocolates thoughtfully place in room by hotel.  In a word I would describe hotel as warm.  Not a chain hotel.  Nothing flashy just understated elegance.  I never write reviews but this was such a nice experience.  I will be a guest again soon. Also included breakfast was great too!,
1,Love this hotel,We have stayed at the Sartell three times in the past five months and can’t stand up about it the service the quality everything is top notch.  Breakfast is included cocktail hour and also appetizers...I give it five stars,
35,A comfortable hotel where you are well taken care of!,The room was beautiful and very spacious. It was nicely decorated and immaculately clean. It had a large bathroom. The amenities were nice| the staff more than polite| helpful and went out of their way to ensure we were comfortable! The food offered for breakfast and happy hour was always fresh and Gabrielle was always ensuring we were properly served and had what we needed! Location was in a quieter area so it was easy to get around. A cab ride was usually 10 dollars to get to Times Square or Show Theatres. The doorman was always available to hail a Taxi. It is located close to a beautiful Park| you can walk to Eataly and the subway was 2 blocks up.,
2,Another superb stay  The Hotel Giraffe,As a family of 4| we stayed at The Hotel Giraffe for a week in November 2017.  This was our second stay at The Giraffe and it was every bit as good as the first time we stayed here five years ago.  The  location is great - very central but away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square.  The staff are very customer orientated and nothing is too much trouble.  We really enjoyed the complimentary light breakfast each morning and the icing on the cake was the wine and cheese reception each evening which was a lovely way to start your evening.  We hope to visit New York again in the not too distant future and we wouldn't think of staying anyway else but the Hotel Giraffe - you will not be disappointed!,
32,A relaxed haven in Manhattan,"This was our second time staying at the Giraffe| our daughter lives nearby making an ideal base when we come to visit her. The rooms are large| comfortable and well-equipped and the lobby lounge area where they serve early evening drinks/snacks is great for getting together before heading out for the evening. They have a ""your guest is our guest"" principle which really makes you feel at home. The staff are all friendly| efficient and helpful| and I would particularly mention Gabriella who makes a point of getting to know her guests (she remembered us from our previous visit two years earlier) and delivers a fantastic service.",
171,Returning Again,Wonderful to be back at the Giraffe we felt at home as soon as we walked through the doors. We managed to get into NYC a little earlier than  expected but were a touch disappointed that we had to wait 40 minutes for our room to become available as it was 3pm when we arrived. This aside however everything else was spot on we received welcome back hugs  from Gabriella when we popped in for a glass of wine that first evening. She is certainly an asset for the Library Collection and makes the cheese and wine experience so pleasurable. Long may she  continue to do so. As we have said previously the location is perfect for our requirements as we walk everywhere and nowhere is too far to walk. The Suite was spotless and spacious with the most comfortable bed. The breakfast staff also…,
63,Excellent location| attentive staff| oversized room.,This was our first overnight trip back to Manhattan since moving out of the East Village. We were back in town for a Christmas party| and decided to valet our car which was very easy. Ended up around the corner from the hotel and a Valet employee came out to Park ave and helped us back up to the front of the hotel so we didn't have to circle around.   The lobby is quaint with the check in on the right plus a sitting area and bar on the left side. The bar does a complimentary wine and cheese happy hour in the afternoon which is a amazing perk. Linda and I arrived at the hotel just after noon which was hours before normal check in time... Regardless we were immediately checked into our room which was also quick and painless.   We upgraded to a suite with our Chase rewards option.…,
17,Very nice boutique hotel| staff| amenities and location,Our King room felt larger than it looked with plenty of shelves to unpack our clothes. For 5 nights it felt spacious and comfortable with a large window and a view. Location was great and 2 block walk to subway. Continental breakfast was nice. We enjoyed a glass of wine at Happy Hour each evening.  The tables were set for small groups but we pulled up chairs and enjoyed mingling. The staff were very helpful| responsive| and always smiling. We loved this hotel and would stay here again.,
24,NYC's best boutique hotel ever!,My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights prior to Christmas and were we WOWed!  Friendly courteous staff| lovely clean room| excellent breakfast included| as well as wine and cheese in the evening.  So very happy with our choice that we will return next time we're in NYC.  And a special shout out to Gabriella who served us coffee in the morning and wine in the evening!,
2,Great Hotel and Staff,Location| rooms| service and staff are always outstanding at this gem of a hotel. We come every year. Don’t eat at the restaurant. But the lobby breakfast and the service are wonderful. Afternoon wine and cheese too. ,
16,Splendid stay,Once more| a fantastic stay in one of the Library Hotel Collection Group| this time in the Hotel Giraffe! Started with a very warm welcome| continuous best support during our stay| a delicious continental breakfast which everything you need| accompanied with an excellence service and a gorgeous room whit all amenities where we were looking for. And everything for a very reasonable price for all we got. We'll come back to NY and definetely will stay in the Giraffe or in another hotel of the Library Collection.,
3,Fabulous stay,Definitely lived up to expectations. Intimate setting staff very helpful and complimentary snacks and coffee a great add on for little cost. Had previously stayed at a 5star in same location there is no comparison I'd choose the giraffe every time,
183,Great little hideaway with plenty to offer,Stayed for a week. Nice helpful staff| great room (suite) and the bonus of having a complementary drinks of wine and light bites (cheese| crackers| olives etc)  every night (5-8pm) and breakfast included (continental style) plus unlimited drinks in the lobby during the day throughout the day.  Great location (Park Ave South and 26th)| away from Times Square| near the subway (23rd and 28th street).,
11,Relaxing at the Hotel Giraffe,The staff at Hotel Giraffe were courteous and friendly. The rooms were generous in size| particularly for New York. It was quiet and peaceful throughout the hotel. We enjoyed the included breakfasts and cheese nights although at times it was difficult to find a seat. It was a very relaxing stay.,
66,so nice to back at the giraffe,My wife and I had stayed at the Hotel Giraffe a number of times...but not for many years as we were away from the area. We finally returned last week...pre Christmas and we were once again overwhelmed by this wonderful hotel. Everything about the hotel is excellent. Reception | bell service| elegant lobby hit you at once. Our room was fabulous| a small balcony looking toward flatiron. Great lunch at their restaurant..wonderful breakfasts and happy hours.  and such professional and warm service. We will never...I mean never..stay anywhere else in Manhattan again. Thanks to the whole crew for a memorable stay,
2,Expected to be wowed,There are so many great reviews about this property but when my husband and I arrived| we weren't wowed by anything. Every hotel has complimentary wine| cheese and wifi these days (which you actually pay for in the form of a facility fee - sneaky| sneaky)| so their amenities are pretty basic at this point. Before arriving| I called to ask what kind of amenities I could add to my stay so I could surprise my husband with a little something for an early anniversary celebration. The gentleman on the phone was helpful but didn't really have any answers for me up front| I had to be placed on hold while he asked the sales coordinator what he could offer me. Finally he gave me a few options and I choose to go with the typical Prosecco and chocolates. When we arrived at our room| the…,
4,Love this hotel,Been here at least 5 or 6 times now visiting NYC. Always charming| friendly and helpful staff. Nicely appointed rooms| although some are small. Really love the breakfast and having other goodies available throughout the day. Great location near Madison Square park and subway access.,
66,One of the best boutique hotels ,One of the best boutique hotels we have ever seen. customer service is great. we are very satisfied. the breakfast is very fresh| quality and delicious. the staff are very polite and good. Gabriella  is so different she is great... Wine&cheese is perfect. Everytime you need you can drink hot drinks and water and eat little something in lobby. Rooms are very clean| housekeeping is great. Rooms are quality and very good. The hotel location is great ...We will come NYC again and we will definetly stay here again...Thank you Hotel Giraffe !,
3,Outstanding| Awesome,First time in NYC and Hotel Giraffe.  Customer service was at it's highest level.  Very impressed.  Already told many of our friends that when we come back to NYC we will be stay at the Hotel Giraffe.  Our complements to all who work there.   Merry Christmas and Happy New Year| Don and Denise Smith ,
1,Wonderful hotel in nyc,The giraffe hotel is a small but excellent hotel in the heart of Manhattan. Nice room with balcony| great breakfast and friendly staff. Especially the early evening complimentary wine hour including piano play is a treat,
8,Great Stay - highly recommend,We just complete a 4 night stay and I would highly recommend to nyc travelers. We had a junior suite for 2 adults and 1 child. It was perfect. There was plenty of room for all 3 of us to get ready at the same time and a fair amount of storage space. The beds and furnishing were tasteful and very comfortable. The bathroom was slightly dated| but not a big deal.   Staff was amazing! Plus is the wine and cheese reception and continental breakfast. Nothing fancy| but nice to pop into the lobby for snacks. There was also water provided in the room daily.   I think the midtown location and price make this hotel a great value!!!,
2,Classy,I stay at Hotel Giraffe whenever I travel to NYC. The location is great| the staff is classy and accommodating| and the rooms are clean and comfortable. I absolutely love the amenities which include a coffee/espresso bar| complimentary snacks| happy hour| and free Internet. The experience here is so refreshing that I really hate when they’re booked and I have to stay elsewhere. I highly recommend this hotel. As I tell my friends| this is the best hotel in the city!,
1,A gem I might be too selfish to share,Amazingly clean.  Amazingly friendly.  After I checked in| I asked many of the employees if they were transplants to New York City (e.g. Not a native New Yorker).  The reason I asked is that I more often than not find New Yorkers to be impatient| rude and generally unkind.  I know| I know| stereotypes get us into trouble.  But nonetheless that has been my experience.  Well| the Giraffe staff are definitely trying and succeeding in breaking that perception.  They were warm| answered my zillion questions| and generally appeared happy with their jobs.  I couldn't have been more surprised and SATISFIED with stay.  The gals working the hospitality bar were charming.  Then there was the room.  Perfectly sized| perfect amenities| perfect overall location.  Very Very clean.  They even…,
6,Clean| Classy and Good Customer Service,We loved our stay at Hotel Giraffe and will definitely be back soon. The coffee machine downstairs was to die for! We loved the quiet rooms| comfy beds and turndown service!!! WOW! The place was immaculate and the staff was helpful and friendly ESPECIALLY Jose the doorman. He helped us with the subway and finding our way around. What a gem!  My only small complaint is when Jose wasn't there the other doorman never opened the door for us. It was freezing cold so I get staying inside near the check in desk. I will definitely be back as we had a lovely time. Thank you,
49,Fantastic hotel and location,Good location from which to walk around NY - close to the flatiron building and Empire State but just south enough to be a little more relaxed.     Staff fantastic - especially Gabriella - and unusually for New York hotel provides complimentary (and extremely tasty - fresh fruit/berries| bagels| muffins| pastries| yoghurts) breakfast and cheese and wine every evening.   Overall - exceptional value.,
5,A calm oasis in the urban jungle of NY,Friendly and helpful staff throughout.  Comfortable and clean rooms. A great atmosphere in the lobby area at breakfast (great) and happy hour (greater) all combined to make this a wonderful trip in a good location.  ,
4,Excellent service| as always,Once again| we stayed at the Hotel Giraffe during a repeat visit to NYC this week.  The bell staff was incredibly patient and persistent in getting us a taxi during a very busy time of day| which was much appreciated.  The front desk staff also volunteered to help reheat our takeout food for our kids| who were starving after a long day of trooping around the city; they brought it back| piping hot and with extra utensils| very quickly.  I've traveled extensively| and it's pretty rare to find that kind of service anywhere| but at the Hotel Giraffe| it's just their baseline.  Will definitely be back!,
20,Birthday Get-Away,Our room was very comfortable and the staff was wonderful.  The only thing I didn't like was that the wine/breakfast area was in the first floor lobby| and my party could never get a seat at a table.  There were a lot of families there| and when I stayed at the other Library Hotels| it seemed as if there were not as many children around and it was more of an adult atmosphere.,
749,Great location with outstanding service.,Splurged and got adjoining rooms with a connecting lounge. Great for a group. Location was very convenient for picking up Uber rides or cabs. Loved that the hotel had a happy hour with free wine and cheese and breakfast included. Room was super comfortable and the double room even had two desk like areas. The hostess for the wine and cheese was delightful as were the doormen and the front desk folks. I will definitely be back. My only gripe was the in the room with the king bed the lighting on the desk was not enough to light up the area. Really such a small detail. I will definitely be back!!!,
97,Home away from home,What appealed to us was the ambiance and homliness (UK interpretation so complimentary!) of this hotel verses the glitzy NY hotel chain sausage machines.  We were not disappointed. Location is S Park Ave so acessable to just about everywhere within a 20-5min walk. Communication was first class. We checked in and were allocated a suite which was spacious and spotlessly clean. All the usual amenities. Staff were all really friendly and helpful with nothing too much trouble. There was a happy hour every evening with wine and cheese and a nice simple continental breakfast in the morning. Nothing too fancy but selection of fruit| cereal| bagels and pastries.,
210,Fantastic location and welcoming staff make you feel at home,I'm so glad i chose to stay centrally for my recent trip to New York. Traveling in a city can be tiring and time consuming but I could walk to many places and the hotel is close to two subway stations what seemed to serve much of Manhattan. The rooms are comfy| great beds| plenty of storage| large| clean bathrooms with excellent showers. My room was not high up and faced on to the street| but I did not find noise a problem. Downstairs there is a nice lobby| it is not big but never seemed crowded and made a nice place to sit and read. The breakfast is excellent - I much appreciated the fresh fruit and yoghurt| but  there was also an excellent selection of bagels and pastries - everything you need really. In the evenings there is wine and cheese - actually it is a bit more than…,
95,Great NYC Stay,This boutique hotel is in a great location just down from the Flatiron building. The staff were friendly and helpful. Our suite was fabulous - really comfortable and spacious| with a great view over Park Ave. The complimentary breakfast and wine and cheese in the evenings were also great| with a good variety of options. Would definitely stay here again!,
93,Delightful in all respects,My friend and I stayed in a Queen x2 room at the Hotel Giraffe for a week around US Thanksgiving. The beds were very comfortable| the room perfect for two women travelling together. Each evening we’d enjoy the wine and cheese hour in the beautifully decorated lounge area. We chatted to other guests and relaxed and enjoyed listening to the piano being quietly played. Then we’d head out for dinner. Breakfasts at the hotel were included in the room cost as was the evening wine and cheeses. Breakfasts were excellent| fresh and delicious.,
22,Friendly Boutique Hotel ,We had a great stay at Hotel Giraffe last weekend - the room was large (by NYC standards) and clean| the staff were friendly and helpful| and we really appreciated the complimentary breakfasts| all day snacks/coffee| and evening wine & cheese. We'll definitely be back!,
55,Good but not great,Nice staff but they forgot to give us the romatic package scheduled for our anniversary.  We had to call and remind the front desk who provided the extras on the following day rather than on our anniversary.  Therfore for this cost it did not live up to our expectations.,
1,Our first trip to NYC,My wife| our daughter and I went on our first trip to NYC for a Christmas vacation.  We stayed at Giraffe and I am so glad we made that decision to stay with them.  The hotel's location was great.  Easy access to restaurants and transportation.  The staff was wonderful| the room was spacious and well decorated and the complimentary breakfasts was great.  We all enjoyed the wine and hor dourves each afternoon after a busy day of shopping and sightseeing.  ,
1,excellent hotel,We try to stay at the Giraffe every time we are in NYC. We love their breakfast in the lobby and the appetizers and wine in the evening. Gaby| who works both of these| is always friendly and sweet! The entire staff at Giraffe is accommodating and efficient. You can't beat the location.,
2,Excellent in every way....this is the place to stay in NYC.,Beautiful hotel| lived up to every review and comment we had read before going. Not the cheapest but well worth it in terms of the personal touch| standard of the room| location and customer service. No doubt we'll be back| just hope it will be as good next time.,
1,Christmas in NY,What a lovely place. It was clean| the staff was friendly and helpful. Good breakfast food and wine and cheese in the evening. It was free also! I will be staying there again when I visit family in the city. ,
37,Wonderful Hotel ,Beautiful hotel with clean well appointed rooms| most with balconies.    Staff was friendly| welcoming and attentive. Will stay there again.   Recommended!  Short walk to Eatily| Madison Square Park and Union Square.   Number 6 subway line  one block from the hotel.,
19,Love Love Love this Hotel,Travelling all the way from Australia to New York where we stayed for six days at the Giraffe Hotel offered an exceptional welcome to this city.  We were greeted every day by wonderful staff.  Housekeeping staff also fantastic.  King Suite offered extremely comfortable bed and bedding as well as exceptionally clean room and balcony.  We could not hear city traffic and after days of walking around the city fell into bed and had relaxing sleeps.  The delightful bonus of this hotel are the continental breakfasts which are included and are always fresh and bountiful and when you came back to hotel at the end of the day there are also limitless drinks| cheese| biscuits| nuts available at no cost in lounge area.  This Hotel is 5 Stars all the way !  Thank you for a great experience.,
251,Love the Complimentary Food and Drink,"As other reviewers have noted| the Hotel Giraffe is a charming Art Deco boutique hotel in the Flatiron District. The staff is warm and friendly| greeting you like family as you come and go.  Check in was very quick. I was assigned to the 3d floor| on 26th Street| so I was worried about traffic noise. But I didn't hear a thing all night. Better yet| the bed was incredibly comfortable. The shower had great pressure and hot water as well.  The crowning feature of the hotel| though| is the ""bar"" in the reception area. At breakfast| various newspapers are available to browse while guests can partake of free coffee| cappuccino| etc| along with croissants| fresh fruit| etc. There's wine and cheese in the evening| and it's not a skimpy affair. The wine is pretty good| as is the cheese|…",
15,Lovely boutique hotel,This is the second time we've stayed at the Hotel Giraffe| and we loved it as much as the first| from the warm welcome when we arrived to the happy hour 5-7 p.m. and the endlessly helpful staff.  Love the Art Deco style of the decor and all the little touches in the rooms.  In my view what makes this place are the staff| who are genuinely engaged with you (if you want them to be) and nothing is too difficult.  The only downside that| being an old building| it's not particularly sound proofed so I didn't sleep as well as I might have (I'm a very light sleeper).  But it won't stop me from returning!,
3,Love Hotel Giraffe,Large rooms. Can get a balconey. Rare in NYC. Small hotel with large hotel benefits. Great location. Love the food and drinks that they continue inually have put in the lobby. Front d so gets to know you too. ,
1,Fabulous time at Hotel Giraffe,We loved our stay at Hotel Giraffe.  We had a suite which was spacious and comfortable - really important as our stay was over 12 nights.  All the staff we interacted with (including front desk| doormen| ladies at the breakfast bar and cocktail time) were very welcoming and professional.  We found the location perfect as we love walking everywhere in New York - very easy walk down to Soho or uptown towards Central Park.  Plus fabulous places to eat in the immediate vicinity!  We felt at home at Hotel Giraffe and would highly recommend to others - we look forward to returning on our next visit.,
3,Perfect for a girls’ weekend!,The rooms were very nice and very| very clean. The price was reasonable and the location was very good ( you’ll be cabbing everywhere anyway!) The hotel was very busy but there was no noise in the rooms. I think this is my new nyc pied à terre...,
9,Excellent Hotel.,We stayed here 6 nights and this hotel was excellent and had a great atmosphere. All the staff were friendly and helpful without exception. Very clean rooms. Great breakfast. Drinks 5pm to 7pm with a piano playing was a great bonus. Excellent location.  Would highly recomend this hotel to anyone going to New York.,
6,Great weekend in NYC,Hotel was pet free| scent free| clean| no mold| great staff| great size for a NY hotel| the breakfast options| snacks| and evening wine and cheese was amazing. We will for sure be back to this hotel! I am very picky on hotels with my asthma and now pregnancy due to my sensitivity to smells and this hotel passed every test. Loved the turn down service. Only critique was that the elevators were slow.,
80,hotel review,this is a great hotel. The people are friendly| the rooms are nice| good location. There is a wine and cheese reception in lobby every night. Every morning a nice breakfast. Guests are welcome. We have stayed here many times. With the night reception and breakfast| it is a good value for NYC,
64,Boutique Hotel with fantastic location| service| and accomodations,Great location| reasonable rates| amazing service.  Stayed here while visiting Manhattan in the summer of 2014. The hotel was a dream.  Very accessible by walking or subway. Unique and fun theme throughout the hotel.,
77,Good in parts and not so in others,It was just a last minute thing to stay at the Giraffe as NYC seems to have zero occupancy this week. The hotel is well located if not totally central and has easy access to the down town areas. It's well refurbished and had a nice wine and cheese evening on arrival. The rooms are comfortable but the heating / cooling is not too efficient. Amenities have to be ordered - like in room tea maker etc. if you don't know then it's too late by the morning. Breakfast is sparse continental. Service in general is good but the outside noise at night kept me awake all night.,
21,BEST in class!,Great hotel in perfect location. The staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. The afternoon happy hour was an unexpected treat. Will stay again for sure. Thank you for the Birthday card| wine| and chocolates. ,
10,Exceptional Hospitality,"The Hotel Giraffe really really ""gets it "" when it comes to taking special care of their guests. The room are exceptional clean and comfortable. The real asset here is the staff. Each individual in each area is well/trained to focus on the guest experience. The front of house| the housekeeping staff and especially the morning and early evening group that provides breakfast and late afternoon wine and cheese are all EXCEPTIONAL.  Congratulations to Giraffe| a wonderful and very special NYC Hotel.  Five Stars on all levels !!",
8,family holiday trip was delightful!!,Hotel Giraffe was a perfect smaller hotel for a family with older teens| in a great location and with lovely rooms.  We enjoyed the evening cocktail hour and the morning breakfast.  The size of the rooms was generous and comfortable.  Service was great!!!,
6,European Charm in the Flatiron District,Hotel Giraffe is not a swanky place| but well appointed and most agreeable.  The rooms (and bathrooms!) are well sized and the beds very comfortable.  But the real charm of this hotel is the friendliness of the staff and the complimentary breakfast and happy hour amenities| much like a European inn.  With it's excellent location| Hotel Giraffe offers a quiet respite from the urban hustle.,
46,Fabulous stay ! perfect for New York !,We were lucky enough to stay at the Hotel Giraffe for 12 nights recently. . It was welcoming and our room was perfect -The room was modern| clean| comfortable bed| with additional items like different pillows available . . Having a balcony was lovely| we were in 11th floor and noise was not a problem . Every morning| we iemjkyed in the delicious foods  for breakfast - bread| Bagels| fruits| yogurt | cereal| juices and teas| coffees. in the evening| we also enjoyed  the wine/cheese. The staff at the breakfast bar and wine/cheese were outstanding | friendly and professional . On fact all employees at this hotel are all so warm & friendly|. The size of the room was fine and we appreciated the bottled water plus turn down service. Our room was always perfectly clean. Hotel is in a…,
141,Excellent Service,This small boutique hotel manages to squeeze a host of helpers behind a small check-in desk in a small lobby. They treat customers like house guests at a fancy estate. There is always food in the lobby and they make you feel very welcome. My room number 1203was on the top floor and so the street noise was minimal| but lower floors might be a problem. The room was modest size| well appointed and immaculate.,
24,Always a good stay,I have stayed at the Hotel Giraffe on a number of occasions| and each time am more than satisfied with my visit. You can run down a list of desired features| and each will be checked off| fast check in| short wait for elevators| an extremely pleasant and helpful staff| clean and well appointed rooms| efficient and complete maid service| good wi-fi speed| a nice| if simple| continental breakfast and early evening wine and cheese tasting. There can be a little street noise - it is NY| but the neighborhood is relatively quiet at night.  There is good access to transportation| and the Flatiron area is loaded with good restaurants. It is not an opulent hotel| they just do everything well.,
11,Always stylish| low-key elegance,The rooms are quiet and beautifully furnished; the amenities are spot on and the staff is there for you all the time; it’s just the right size and the location right off Madison Square Park and across the street from the subway is perfect| away from the maddening crowd.,
4,Wonderful stay,A comfy| cosy| winter stay. Rooms very generous size for NYC. On site restaurant lovely food. Service fantastic| and breakfast| wine and cheese a great bonus. Great location and would have loved to stay longer! Highly recommend.,
101,Good intimate feeling,Overall great hospitality. Free breakfast and happy hour. Exceptional staff. The rooms are a little dated and in need of updates. Although the beds were comfortable. I enjoyed common areas. They place feels homey and the guests are return customers. ,
6,Fantastic NYC Hotel,My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for 5 days/nights. At check-in| Nick was very pleasant and friendly. Checking in was easy and quick which we were grateful for after a long flight and it was almost 11pm. The room was modern| clean and very cozy. Having a balcony was an added bonus and allowed for fresh air into the room. Every morning| we indulged in the convenient and delicious foods set out for breakfast. Bagels| fruits| cereal| juices and coffees were nicely laid out. Arletty was extremely friendly and professional and would toast the breads and make us coffee (in their very fancy coffee machine which also includes hot chocolate). This was a very nice way to start our morning. In the evening| we also enjoyed (LOVED) the wine/cheese bar. Gabriela (hostess) was…,
348,Clean & Classy,My friend who was visiting town picked this hotel. She is a classy gal who likes a bit of luxury. Hotel Giraffe fit the bill. Nice comfy beds and a good shower. The reception area has free coffee/tea| cookies/crackers in the afternoon. Lovely if you are resting up for another show / attraction.,
6,Great Hotel For Anyone!!,My Family and I spent the last 5 days at this hotel at the recommendation of a coworker and were so surprised at how incredible the hotel was (especially for the price!!!). The hotel staff was friendly| the continental breakfast was wonderful and the free wine and cheese happy hour every evening was a wonderful surprise.  They even made hot chocolate for our kids during the happy hour and/or at breakfast.  The rooms are extremely nice.  The location of the hotel is perfect for those who want to visit New York| but do not want to be in the center of the action ALL the time.  There are subway stops close by and you can get anywhere in less than 20 minutes.  Very happy and we will be back.,
1,Nice| comfy| and clean,I enjoyed my stay. The staff was helpful| room was clean and classy| and the location was fairly quiet (typical NYC noise aside). The area is close to just about everything. Will likely stay at this hotel again in the future.,
46,Too high expectations from TripAdvisor rating,The hotel was ok. But we’d just come from the number 1 rated TripAdvisor hotel in San Francisco so we had high expectations. There was nothing stand out to us. And it’s so noisy we never got more than 5 hours sleep any night| even with ear plugs.,
10,OUR BEST STAY IN NEW YORK.,We have been to New York and depending on the dates and the best offer| we have stayed in several hotels from 2 stars to 5 stars and we mainly made our reservation at the Giraffe because of their reviews and the price and we came home so satisfied that we will no longer look for special offers and we will stay here as our first choice. Just a wonderful that has all the positives one can expect and hope for in a New York hotel. If staff you read this: Thank you for a wonderful week in your hotel.,
147,Love the Library Hotel Collection,I've stayed in all of Library Hotel except this one. I had to take a trip to NYC for business/pleasure and decided to try Hotel Giraffe. Great location| check-in was a breeze. We timed our arrival to coincide with happy hour in the lobby. Good job| me. I booked a King suite| which was large and well-designed.The room was quiet despite being on the 2nd floor overlooking the street. Work/desk area was separate from the bedroom which made early morning work calls tolerable for everyone. The bathroom was nice (although my daughter didn't like the frosted glass door) and amenities generous.The bed was really comfortable and we did| at some point| strip off the pillowcase to find the brand name of the linens. I would buy them in a heartbeat. Great stay| fabulous lounge staff| free…,
5,Feeling like Family at the Giraffe again in NYC,There's a warm welcome back| the perfect sized outfitted rooms| the lobby with breakfast and happy hour| the restaurant downstairs| and most of all the delightful staff who serve and service each of the highlights I just listed...Awesome experience. Be back soon Giraffe!!  ,
1,Beautiful boutique hotel in the heart of Manhattan!,Hotel Girraffe is a delightful boutique hotel in a wonderful location.  Staff are incredibly friendly and helpful.  Room was good size for NYC with all modern amenities.  Lovely breakfast and lobby with wine in the evening.  Great place for a nice weekend get away!!!  Very stylish and classy with fresh flowers and tasteful decorations.,
2,Giraffe Hotel,Great location.  Lovely rooms| great service both at front desk and at the continental breakfast/happy hour.  The lobby is a charming place to enjoy each or just to read and relax. Would definitely return for business or pleasure. ,
1,Good hotel for family groups,In NYC to see the Veterans Day parade| we and other family members took four separate rooms at the Hotel Giraffe.  Our King Suite with sitting area was one popular gathering spot for us| as was the lobby where we could enjoy lattes| tea| and Pepperidge Farm cookies.  With only seven rooms per floor| the Giraffe is not too crowded and the group could enjoy the lobby in peace after outings.  (Breakfast does get a little crowded.),
2,Always a great place to stay in NYC,Our 3rd weekend stay at the Giraffe| each as good as the other. Very comfortable rooms| well appointed and serviced. Breakfast and late afternoon hospitality in the lounge is really excellent| truly a home from home experience.,
66,Service| ,There are provide one of the best service like 5srar hotel and also there many many various type room so you can shooed your variety room and also they provide better service to his guest and also nice welcome in hotel!!!  Go with your family and enjoy!!!,
203,A little on the expensive side but worth it,We chose this hotel for our post Trans Atlantic cruise based on the TA reviews and it lived up to all of them.  Great welcome in the early morning and although we could not get our rooms they offered us breakfast and a text when our rooms were ready.  Enormous two room suite and contemporary rooms/furnishing.  The highlight though was the lovely lady who served us copious white wines in the early evening. Location was also great being close to two or three subway stops. Would stay again especially if the £ were to improve against the $,
1,Awesome hotel,One of the nicest things about staying at the Hotel Giraffe was the friendly and helpful staff.    They were so accommodating and really made our overnight stay in NYC  a special experience.   We loved having a room with a balcony (although small) and enjoyed being able to crack the door open to hear the sounds of the city while we slept.    Finally| the location was great and certainly convenient to both uptown and downtown activities.    ,
2,NY in November,I had a wonderful experience at this hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room better than what I expected. The bed really comfortable. Wine and cheese in the afternoon and breakfast in the morning is so convenient and lovely. It was located well for getting around the city by train.,
4,Highly recommended,There are not a lot of nice hotel options in this part of Manhattan.  This is a great combination of a reasonably priced hotel with great service. My room was large for New York so this is a good value.  The receptionist and bellman could not have been nicer.  Don't expect a full service hotel but all the basics are covered. Nice continental breakfast with excellent coffee is included. I was given a pass to use a full service health club 3 blocks away. Valet parking.,
8,Nice Hotel !,Convenient halfway Downtown and Central Park. Subway close| food- pharmacy shops close| good restaurants close | hotel restaurant Bread and Tulip very good! Breakfast could be more various| maybe some vegetables| cold cuts. There was plenty of fruit| bagels| cereals| juices. Staff is extremely helpful and kind ! We would go back again! ,
1,favorite hotel in NYC,Love staying at Hotel Giraffe| great location and larger than expected rooms.  The staff are the best.   Enjoy all the extras including wine in the evening| nice breakfast and round the clock coffee. We will choose this hotel next time we come to NYC|,
4,Stylish and Well-Designed,The rooms are small but so well-designed that the lack of space does not much matter. The staff is friendly and efficient. The lobby is large and comfortable. The breakfasts are very good with excellent coffee and pastries and terrific bagels. The location is good and only two blocks away from the subway. Everything about the hotel is tasteful and stylish. ,
43,Great Location,I was in town for business and needed to have easy access to Penn Station and Farmer and the Fish. The number of restaurants| bars| and shops in walking distance was great. Our room was on the second floor and had a sweet balcony overlooking the street and Upland across the street. We really enjoyed it and the bathroom was spacious and easy to arrange our toiletries. The room was clean| the bed comfortable| and at under $400 the price seemed fair. The front desk staff was not very friendly or focused on helping us understand what was available to us. The clerk ran through her list like the rapid-fire disclaimer talking at the end of a radio spot. It was disappointing| because I wanted to love it| but she made me feel unwelcome.,
70,Best NYC Hotel experience ever ! ,I am not kidding. And I stay in NYC often and have had wonderful experiences elsewhere ( see rave reviews of The Refinery for example ) but HOTEL GIRAFFE takes things to another level altogether.   We're talking elevated.  Premium. Affordable luxury.  Putting the B in Boutique Hotel.   Now I am spoiled for New York City.    Not my typical neighbourhood| but well worth a little walk to our midtown/ Bryant Park area office for this kind of hospitality and overall sophistication.  Thank you| Giraffe| for making my birthday so memorable.  Waking up here really got 'my day' off to a superb start.   Next time| I had better bring my wife to share it with !   ,
8,Another Great experience at a Library Collection Hotel,Stayed for just one night on a business trip.  Staff was very accommodating and friendly.  Room was clean| very attractive and comfortable.  Free continental breakfast was a nice touch.  Wished I could have stayed longer and this will be my new go-to hotel when staying in lower Manhattan.,
81,A great base for visiting NYC,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Giraffe| a boutique hotel situated on Park Avenue South. We had a fairly large room with a Juliette balcony and two double beds which catered very well for the 2 adults and 2 children in our party. The decor was excellent as was the quality of the beds and fittings| and it was a very pleasant place to return to after a hard day's sightseeing. Being able to stand at the balcony and watch the world go by was an added bonus| although not all rooms have a view so make sure to check.  The continental breakfast is served each morning in the lobby - plenty of fresh fruit| cereals| breads and bagels| plus two very helpful staff to make your drinks for you and generally see that you're ok. We loved the informality and the fact that there was only a…,
2,A great place to stay,The location is close to subways| Times Square and Central Park. The rooms are nice| the continental breakfast is good and the servers are very accommodating. The wine in the evening is equally as nice.   Stayed there three times now| and has been pleasant each time. ,
1,At home in NYC,Decor well-done| spacious bath| clean and comfortable.  Staff are kind| courteous and aware. Hotel is well-located for strolling or using public transportation| Breakfast buffet is just right! I’m always happy to be there.,
12,New York visit with family,Four of us (2 adults and 2 children) stayed in a balcony double room for six nights in late October. We had a fantastic stay. The room was big by New York standards (but may have been a bit squashed for 4 adults). The beds were extremely comfortable and we slept well. The daily breakfast was a real bonus - fresh fruit| yoghurts| pastries and bagels with friendly staff on hand to assist. The early evening wine and cheese was also a great feature| again served by friendly| enthusiastic (and generous!) staff. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. It is pricey but worth it in our view and we will definite be back!,
34,Wonderful stay!,My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Giraffe during a recent trip to New York.  Everything from beginning to end was absolutely perfect! The staff were exceptionally friendly and accommodating.  Mike| in particular| was incredibly helpful during our stay.  Our room was spacious| quiet| contemporary and comfortable.  The location could not have been any better.  Most places we wanted to be| in Manhattan| were within walking distance.  There are an abundance of wonderful restaurants in the nearby vicinity| including one next door that delivers to the hotel.  We could not have asked for a better hotel.  We will certainly be returning to the Hotel Giraffe on our next visit to New York! ,
12,Great location and wonderful staff,Great location | generous sized room for NYC| and helpful friendly staff.  Nice continental breakfast and late afternoon wine and cheese included.  Easy to walk to Union Square as well as Broadway| with close access to Subway.  ,
52,perfect stay,I have stayed at Hotel Giraffe several times now and each trip has been perfect. Staff is always professional and helpful. Lobby refreshments are always welcome at the start and end to my day. The rooms are well appointed and quiet. Great location and close to all. ,
26,Great location and staff,Very nice| comfortable room in a location close to everything.  What sets this hotel apart from others is the always friendly and attentive staff.  From the front desk| to the maids to the breakfast & happy hour servers.  They really go out of their way to make you feel welcomed and make sure that you're taken care of.,
13,Ticks all the boxes,We stayed here for a week in mid-September. We had a Queen size bed with a small sitting room. Very comfortable and excellent value. Very clean and quiet. Staff were friendly and professional. Lovely breakfasts and  relaxed foyer with complementary coffee and cookies. Very convenient location.,
1,Happily surprised,I loved this hotel.  I'm not a frequent traveler to NYC and my expectations were exceeded. Great location on Park Avenue| the hotel staff was very helpful and friendly| very clean and decor was beautiful.  The room itself was a good size (king suite) and furnishings seemed new/recently updated.  Despite the busy Park Ave location| it was surprisingly quiet at night.  The only downside was no view from the room.  Would definitely stay here again.  ,
4,Magnificient Trip,The Giraffe Hotel is a delight to stay at.  The employees are most gracious and helpful.  We never stay anywhere else when visiting NYC.  In particular we think the world of Happy Hour hostess Gabriela| who remembers us from previous stays and makes us feel so welcome.,
1,great stay,We loved this hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. We LOVED the breakfast and wine and cheese in the afternoon. That is what will bring us back. We loved the quiet environment and peace that we felt when we came back at the end of the day.,
1,My new favorite hotel.,The staff is quite welcoming.  I stayed twice in October.   They have all day tea| coffee fruit.  Serve breakfast and wine n cheese in the afternoon.  The staff in the lobby is pleasant including the doorman ,
47,Great boutique hotel in midtown Manhattan,This is a great little boutique hotel in midtown Manhattan| across Madison Square Park from Eataly. You know that feeling of expectation you have when you open a hotel room door for first time| right after you've checked in? Our 7th-floor room was very chic and well-appointed| but looked a bit small and dark. However| once we opened the doors to the Juliet balcony| it was charming. The floor-to-ceiling French doors made all the difference| allowing for light and air when opened. Funnily enough| I’m not sure they were double-paned| because there was a lot of street noise at night| but then again| we were in Manhattan. The noise was not a big deal for us| but we did notice it.  Besides the balconies and the chic decor| the wait staff at the breakfast and happy hour is what make…,
94,Loved it,My wife and I stayed for a weekend in October 2017. Arrived on Friday night| and to our surprise| they had a complimentary happy hour with wine and cheese. A great start to our stay. The room was well appointed and comfortable. The staff was excellent and attentive. The location was excellent. I good starting point for a walk to Central Park or down to Little Italy (about 20-30 blocks in each direction). The lobby was bright and warm and tripled as a place to enjoy a continental breakfast provided by the hotel| a sitting area during the day and the aforementioned happy hour in the evening. We will definitely be returning.,
100,Overall excellent,I have stayed at the hotel giraffe several times in the last year and it has become my favorite hotel in the area. Rooms are clean and spacious.  Breakfast and snacks throughout the day are good.  Location is good.   Staff is generally excellent.  This trip| staff was a bit lacking on front door coverage and assistance with bags.  One if the male staff members greeted me with “good morning” as he stood by and watched me drag three suitcases off the elevator without offering assistance.  Same lack of service was received when I checked in.  Perhaps something for management to be aware of and work on.  ,
221,Excellent stay,Stayed 5 nights in September in a king room with balcony up on the 8th floor. What a lovely boutique hotel. Above average room sizes for NYC. Staff extremely friendly & efficient. Room was very clean & tidy with top quality linens.   Hardly any noise up on the 8th floor from the city streets below. Great location for walking out - just a 20 minute stroll up Broadway to Times Square and a bit less to the ESB.  Also short walk to nearby subway stations.    Wine & cheese had a relaxed atmosphere setting us up nicely before going out to dinner in the evening. Prosecco| white or red with a large selection of cheese| crackers & nuts. Very friendly hostess made us feel extremely welcome and kept our glasses topped up!!. Giraffe also has an open air terrace on the 12th floor where you…,
1,As a giraffe conservationists - what better place to stay!,Excellent from the first correspondence. A lovely friendly team with an amazing product. A must for anyone with a love for giraffe and a great location in NY. And hopefully together we can all get the hotel to help us save giraffe in Africa - nudge nudge!,
427,Nice little hotel,Rooms are clean comfortable and apparently rather freshly renewed| staff is very helpful| lobby lounge is nice| breakfast is somehow disappointing for American standards ... no eggs if not boiled. Ladies there are very helpful and nice| reasonable price but I am not sure to return ,
4,Lovely Hotel,Everything was perfect! The location: close to the Empire State Building and Time Square. Between two Subway station of the green line. Not to noisy area. The room: we took a family room with two big beds. The size of the room and the bathroom was good to accommodate 4 people. The deco and the cleanliness were perfect. The room was quiet considering being in the middle of NY. The service was very friendly. We very much appreciated the self-service bar offer in the evening with biscuits and vine. The breakfast was simple in a cosy atmosphere. Ham and scrambled eggs would have been a plus ;-) We warmly recommend this friendly hotel in the middle of NY.,
16,Classy and comfortable,I spent three nights here and then moved to a conference hotel nearer Times Square - but wished I could've stayed at Giraffe longer. This is a nice boutique hotel| close to the subway and hence all the best NYC has to offer. Staff were very friendly and accommodating for this dazed| jet-lagged Aussie.,
1,LOVELY WEEKS STAY IN NEW YORK,We stayed at the Giraffe hotel for 6 nights in late September and had a thoroughly enjoyable stay. We found the staff very welcoming & always happy to help. The room itself was very comfortable & a good size with everything we needed for our stay. Having stayed in New York a few times it was nice to be away from the crowds of frenetic Times square but with the Giraffe just a short walk away from a subway stop at 28th street it was very easy to get around the City. The food at the Italian restaurant at the hotel was very enjoyable as was the continental breakfast in the reception area at the Giraffe  & the nightly cheese & wine was just what we needed pre-dinner after a day spent enjoying walking around New York. If you like Jazz there is a great Jazz club| Jazz standard| just…,
1,The Giraffe was terrific,The Giraffe Hotel  Only two nights here but great location Happy hours drinks and nibbles Fabulous free breakfast and all staff were terrific We even got upgraded to a suite loved our fluffy white towels and spacious accommodation!,
16,Amazing Stay| Thanks to Hotel Giraffe!,I don't know where to begin praising Hotel Giraffe. Should I start with the amazing location? The gorgeous and spacious rooms? The amazingly helpful front-desk staff? The free wine and cheese near dinner time? Our stay in New York City was that much better| thanks to Hotel Giraffe.  My partner and I arrived almost three hours before check-in. We had intended to just leave our bags at the front desk| but the gent behind the counter checked us in| and then asked us to wait in the beautifully sun-light lobby for about 15 minutes (not sure we even waited that long) while the cleaning staff finished up. That means my partner and I got to do a little work while we waited| as well as enjoyed the complimentary espresso machine and a wide assortment of snacks| which seemed to always be…,
32,Perfect !,My husband and I stayed one night this past weekend and absolutely love this hotel ! I am a little picky and I have to say I will definitely be back !  This hotel is clean| just the right size and employees could not be more helpful and pleasant!  Everyone we encountered from door man right down the line !! Continental breakfast is just right| lobby area perfect size| beds comfortable (pillows a little flat for me) beautiful bathroom... we walked everywhere (sometimes a little over a mile) we wanted to go.  If I had to find any flaws| I'd say the doors shut a little hard therefore| there is some noise in the hallway.  I don't think it's the guests fault| if you let the door go| it shuts very hard.  Certainly didn't keep us up by any means. Book this hotel| you won't be sorry !!,
13,Fabulous NYC,Stayed 4 nights at this small lovely hotel.  Good location| halfway between uptown & downtown so was less busy & noisy.  Spacious comfortable room with air con| nice continental breakfast.  All staff were great| reception| at breakfast and room maids.  Actually managed to get back for one of the cheese & wine receptions and it was very enjoyable.  Always drinks| cakes| biscuits and fruit available just help yourself and take it up to your room.  The only reason I've given it a 4 not a 5 is the seating at breakfast although very comfortable the chairs are too low for the tables.  If you book this hotel you won't be disappointed.,
3,First Visit,This is the first time I have stayed at the Hotel Giraffe.  Our room was larger than expected and very well laid out.  The hotel was very clean and the staff was extremely friendly and and helpful.  The complimentary happy hour was a pleasant surprise.  It was very nice to relax in the lounge with a glass of wine and healthy appetizers.  The hotel is well located with several good restaurants within easy walking distance. This is my new hotel when I stay in NYC! ❤️,
1,Great location and Nice service,My husband and I stayed here for 9 nights-and it was wonderful. The location is great| it's easy to get to the 6 and the RW| and the area isn't super touristy so it's less crowded than staying around Times Square. The hotel itself is very nice| clean| and we really enjoyed having a balcony. The rooftop garden is really nice-we did wish it stayed open longer| but not a big deal. The staff is very accomodating| and the free snacks/drinks is a definite plus. Definitely recommend| and will probably stay here the next time we visit New York City,
101,The reviews are all true,The unanimous reviews led us here| and our stay over the weekend confirmed what everyone else has said.  Perfect location| on Park and 26th| easy parking on the weekends on the street and especially at night to avoid having to pay for a garage. We had a king room with balcony on the 11th floor overlooking Park Avenue| only about 7 rooms on each floor.  A bit of street noise Saturday night| which faded after midnight| and Sunday was quiet.  The room was spacious and spotless| the bed a bit soft for those that like that.  The hotel looked new or newly renovated. Great complimentary amenity of wine and cheese during early evenings and expansive breakfast in the mornings.  Service was friendly and most efficient.  Only downside was the a/c blew toward the bed| though the heat was…,
465,A Perfect Place for Us,A friend recommended this place and we liked it a lot.  The location was good for us near subway stations and one of our favorite eateries Eataly.  Our room was a nice size| the bed was comfortable| the bathroom was adequate| the lobby very comfortable and a nice small size boutique hotel.  The complimentary breakfast has fresh fruit| yogurt| hard boiled eggs| pastries| bagels| toast| juices and coffees.  There is also a complimentary wine and cheese service in the early evening that includes cheese| crackers| olives| veggies and wine.  They have coffee and fruit available all the time.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  We will definitely stay there on our next visit.,
7,Perfect Boutique hotel, The rooms are large and comfortable and the service is impeccable. Everyone from the front desk to housekeeping to the wonderful women who staff the breakfast and  afternoon wine and cheese are professional| helpful and very kind. I’ve never stayed at a hotel where I didn’t find something which needed to be done better but  this hotel is perfect  in every way.  Best kept secret .,
34,Perfect Gem in the City,This was my work approved hotel where I stayed for 2 nights in the city.  It could not have been more perfect.  From the second my taxi pulled up| my (super heavy) suitcases were whisked to the reception.  I was not feeling well at all and check in was super speedy and then I was led to my gorgeous room| flowered balcony included! The room was spotless and so pretty! There was free wine & cheese / afternoon tea (depending on your choices at the buffet hehe) every evening and free breakfast every morning.  The rooftop terrace was a little oasis of calm and I would have loved to have more time there to enjoy drinks.  The location was also super convenient for everything I needed. I just have nothing bad to say about this hotel - everything from beginning to end was perfect (&…,
25,This Chic Boutique Hotel Supersedes Itself Once Again,I love love love Hotel Giraffe!   I'm a Londoner living in New York - My visiting family and friends have stayed here on my recommendation so many times| over so many years| for so many reasons… I recently rented a suite at my favourite hotel for a celebration… and we were treated like ABSOLUTE royalty.   The staff are always exceptionally attentive| but| in a non-intrusive way. As I've said before in my previous reviews (I'm a BIG BIG fan of this place) - I keep coming back to the Hotel Giraffe for a reason.   This hotel is gorgeous| it's in the perfect location| it has character| it feels special… because the staff go out of their way to make the guest feel special. Oh!  And the complimentary wine and cheese served to guests in the lounge/reception area really add to the…,
107,Excellent in all respects,Definitely the best hotel we have stayed at in New York.  The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was a good size and a welcome retreat after a busy day in the city. Our stay was enhanced by the excellent buffet breakfast and the evening wine reception.   Location of the Giraffe is great with a number of restaurants nearby.  We will certainly return to the Giraffe on our next trip to New York and will recommend the hotel to others.,
25,Great spot and friendly people - but it is noisy!,We enjoyed our time here at the Hotel Giraffe - great location and very friendly. Everything is as shown on their website. Lovely to have a glass of wine in the evening and we had a light breakfast on a couple of mornings as well. Unfortunately the noise from the street - in particular the rubbish collections are so noisy we were woken up through the night when ever they were emptied! Yes I wore ear plugs| yes it still woke me up!,
4,Mrs.,I was in NYC visiting our son...and I was interested in finding a boutique hotel near mid-town.  This was perfect.  The lobby was cool and inviting| my double room was huge (by NYC standards)| and all the folks were super helpful and friendly.  ,
22,Great hotel,Stayed 3 nights| good room and lovely staff. Room immaculqte and had a balcony too. Highly recommended for access to NYC| and thd wine/cheese is a great little extra too. Really like this place and would definitely stay there again.,
67,Excellent hotel in an excellent location,The Hotel Giraffe is a fantastic option for your next New York stay.  From the moment that you arrive at the hotel| you will notice that the staff go out of their way to help.   The check in process was exceptionally fast and efficient and took less than 5 minutes.  The front lobby is where they serve the breakfast each morning as well as the wine and cheese in the afternoon.   There is a constant option in the lobby for coffee| tea and other snacks which is great after a day of exploring New York.  The room is quiet| clean and well appointed.   There was a fridge| safe| robes| slippers| radio as well as toiletries for use in the bathroom that included cue-tips| gauze pads| shower cap and a great selection of shampoo and soaps.  The bed was comfortable and the sheets were clean.…,
1,936,A very pleasant experience-with no resort fee,Booked through chase ultimate rewards and really enjoyed the small boutique hotel. located kind of in midtown at E26 and park ave. Check in was easy and hoping for an upgrade because they were not full but no go. We did arrive in time for the 5-8pm wine and cheese reception and met the so hyped Gabriella. She was amazing. Knew exactly when to refill your glass or take your plate away. Proseco was decent and a low level chard and cab sauvignon from Mondavi. the breakfast from 7-10 was excellent. Espresso| coffee| pastries| cereal| fresh fruit and yogurt. Everything was great. Hotel room was decent| not big and not small| but the bathroom door opened and block the shower so that was awkward. Only 2 elevators but we didn't have to wait long. Easy to find taxis and ubers on the…
6,Wonderful Property,A nice respite in the city. The rooms are well appointed and the breakfast buffet and the wine in the afternoon are nice additions to the accommodations. If you can get one of their junior suites you’ll have lots of room to stretch out. ,
1,Hotel Giraffe NYC Simply the Best,Everything was perfect. Comfortable bed| surprisingly quiet in theheart of New York City. Great location. Wine and cheese happy hour. Price was right. Attentive friendly staff. Definitely will stay there again. ,
27,NYC Boutique Hotel,"Hotel Giraffe is a gem of an accommodation. The turnover of staff is minimal| based on our experiences over the past two years| and the personnel recognize us even though we stay at the hotel only once or twice each year. The rooms are immaculate and comfortable. Moreover| the breakfast| although basic| is fulfilling| and the late-afternoon wine and cheese offerings in the lobby of the hotel are a big plus. It's our ""go-to place"" in the Big Apple!",
1,Poor concierge/management staff hospitality,Regardless of how good a hotel´s facilities are| its staff and its hospitality are in great sense| what define a guest´s experience. Has anyone gone back to a place because of its hospitality regardless of how bad initial judgment based on its facilities were? I have. There is great responsibility in being a top rated hotel and from my past trip experience| the Hotel Giraffe´s staff do not seem to be aware of such. Guest´s expectations at this kind of places tend to be overwhelming and measures need to be taken by its staff to fulfill them. Concierge/front desk staff are definitely not up to par| especially given the classy atmosphere within the place. I was charged a ridiculous amount of money by what seemed to be a high ranking staff member after asking for a very simple…,
10,Lovely stay at Giraffe Hotel,We thoroughly enjoyed our wonderful stay at Giraffe  Hotel. The location was perfect for walking to central park | highline park| Village areas and in between.   Attention to detail and personal service was superb.   I commend your manager and all the staff personnel who truly went above and beyond the call of duty. ,
5,we loved our stay at Hotel Giraffe,"We had a wonderful stay at Hotel Giraffe.  A great location| super helpful staff| especially Gabby| and excellent accommodations.  Both the Continental Breakfast and the evening Cocktail party were definitely ""musts"" each day.  Will certainly stay with Hotel Giraffe on our next trip to NYC.",
2,The best place ever!,The staff was efficient and friendly. The breakfast was perfect. The wine and cheese beyond great.....All in all| a hotel that I'll stay at again and again....cannot say enough about the experience. A wonderful time....,
51,Great stay!,My two girlfriends and I had a great stay at Hotel Giraffe.  We were welcomed warmly at check in and were able to get into our room a few hours early which was nice.  We had a king suite which was great for 3 people.  My friend said the sofa bed was comfortable and it was all set up for us which was very nice.  The room was a little dark since the interior faced a courtyard and the curtains were thick and covered about half of the window| but it was decorated nicely and the bed was  comfortable.  The bathroom had a large counter which we appreciated since 3 of us were sharing it.  What really sets this hotel apart| however| is the service - especially Gabriella.  She was so nice and efficient - she even remember our wine selections from the night before when we came down on…,
2,Comfort and luxury in a great neighbourhood!,Loved this hotel for their great central location (we walked almost everywhere) and comfortable beds and rooms. We had a balcony king which was very spacious and clean! Plus fresh New York bagels at breakfast and a wine and cheese reception every night (both included) - you can't go wrong. We will stay here again!,
4,Excellent stay,We arrived on Friday afternoon and stayed until late Monday morning.  Our room was very nice| clean| and comfortable.  The evening wine and cheese was wonderful and the breakfast was also very good.  The staff was outstanding| the location for us was perfect as we could walk just about everywhere that we needed to go on this trip.  Would definitely stay here again.,
61,Large rooms| great location ,Afternoon snacks are provided as well as a continental breakfast and coffee. This is a great place to see the tourist sites near  midtown (Empire State| Madison Square Garden| Korea Town| Macy's) The rooms are quite and well insolated.The rooms are beautifully decorated and up to date.,
1,Great Hotel| Great Location,7 night stay commencing 22 September 2017| first time in NYC. Superb location. Stayed in a suite on 10th floor. Quiet room| despite the constant traffic on Park Avenue.  Rooftop bar is nice.  Excellent facilities| great air conditioning| it was very hot during our stay. Room clean and well tended to. As mentioned by others| the complimentary wine and cheese is most welcome after a long day sightseeing. Excellent service by Gabrielle.  Nothing much more to add| other than to recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to be well located in central Manhattan| well looked after by efficient| courteous staff| to enjoy nice breakfasts| and a great night's sleep at the end of each day.,
307,Great Location for a fun weekend in the City,Really enjoyed this hotel.  Adorable lobby| yummy breakfast included (bagels| cereal| fruit| muffins)| all day delicious free coffee and cookies.  The rooftop patio is so nice and comfortable.  We had a beautiful balcony king room| comfortable and well equipped.  They park your car for 45$ but there is some street parking.  It is a great location to walk to Chelsea| the flat iron district and 15-20 mins walk to west Village.,
8,Excellent spot for a NY getaway!,One of the best hotels stays we've had!  The service is excellent from the moment you arrive| and we were warmly greeted and helped by all of the staff for the entire week that we stayed there.   The hotel has a fantastic wine and cheese offering in the lobby every evening which we enjoyed a number of times| as well as a nice continental breakfast which made for a great start to the day.  Incredible experience| and we would definitely stay here again!,
6,Love this Hotel!,We loved the beautiful room with lots of space for your things. We loved the extra care housekeeping took to provide great service by bringing us the coffee maker we had requested sooner than expected.We loved the cheerful and efficient breakfast staff and the delicious bagels and coffee and fruit among other delights like pastries. We loved the front desk staff and the bellmen who were always attentive| especially Gabby and Jose. We loved the homey feel of the hotel. Won't stay anywhere else. ,
1,The staff knows your name!,Luxury and comfort in a boutique setting. It felt like we belonged| the staff greeted us by name and went above and beyond to ensure an amazing stay. The service was top notch and we loved our balcony!,
12,Excellent Hotel| Amazing Service,The room was amazing!  Very comfortable bed| lots of space| great layout.  I did not get to partake in the wine and cheese reception| but the breakfast provided by the hotel was excellent!  A great selection of food| and friendly staff.  I also took advantage of the all-day coffee and cookies :)  A nice addition is their rooftop bar| which provides awesome views of NYC and a really nice outdoor space! I stayed here the night before my wedding| in the King suite with balcony so that I'd have space to get ready with my bridal party the next day.  From the time I made the reservation until after my stay| the staff was incredibly helpful.  They answered all of my questions and allowed me to see the room beforehand.  They also let me use the rooftop for a first look with my fiance.…,
53,Good Location,Enjoyed our 4 night stay the staff were all helpful and friendly. The location was great for visiting all of the sites. Our room on the 3rd floor did mean that there was some traffic noise but not enough from stopping a good nights sleep. The buffet breakfast was a very good start to the day.,
4,Great stay!,We loved the location of the Hotel Giraffe.  Our room was amazingly quiet for a city room on a corner.  The breakfast was delicious and everyone at the hotel was so nice and welcoming.  Would definitely recommend!,
1,A boutique hotel that felt like home and more!!,I loved the hotel and ALL the wonderful people who were so willing to help with any question or request....from Chris and Ray before I arrived to Stephan and Gaby and Nick and also Gabriela and Laura at both breakfast (great spread and choice for all) and wine time at 5 pm. SO civilized. Felt like an Oasis from the noise and speed of the city. Also met Carmen| Head Housekeeper who was both elegant and so willing to help. Have left some other names off but everyone was wonderful!! Staff makes a place as well as the comfort which I found in my room....with a charming balcony and refrigerator and A/C that were quiet (not always the case). Bed was SO comfortable and the radio with stations and nature sound choices made it easier to sleep.Cleaning staff great too...can't praise it…,
1,1st stay at Hotel Giraffe,We absolutely loved this hotel!!  Great rooftop bar| spacious and comfortable rooms.  Will definitely return.  The surrounding area was wonderful!!  Service was excellent and the staff remembered our names. And the cost was very affordable.,
21,"Great Manhattan weekend spot in ""NoMa""",We found the Hotel Giraffe to be the perfect weekend getaway in The City. We've stayed at MANY fine hotels in Manhattan| but none better than this. Welcoming staff| clean and beautiful room| excellent location in NoMA area. Also| directly across the street from excellent restaurant| Upland.,
1,Improved  common  area,We  thought  the  little  suite ( 306) was  comfortable| and  the  hotel location  worked  for  us  on  this  occasion.  We  appreciated  both the  continental breakfast  and  the  afternoon happy  hour  in the  main floor  common area. The  staff there  was  excellent| but  we  found  the  room itself  uninviting.  We  think the  ambiance  of  that space  could  be  GREATLY improved.,
26,Wonderful!,Very accommodating for people with allergies.  Feather free room| small fridge to store special dietary needs| VERY clean bathroom!  Lovely wine and cheese each evening and fresh continental breakfast each morning.  Valet parking makes in and out easy and reasonable!,
1,Loved our stay.,We loved our stay at the Hotel Giraffe.  The staff were very friendly and made you feel at home.  We were on vacation but it would suit a business trip equally well.  The location is fantastic as it’s easy to get to places as a subway is really close or you can walk.  Our room was nice and spacious and was kept clean throughout our stay.  I would highly recommend staying here and would return if and when in NYC again.,
72,Quirky well located and comforatble hotel at a reasoonable price,This is a boutique quirky hotel very well located at the corner of Park Avenue and Twenty six Street. In the foyer it has a small bar and café where breakfast is served and in the evening| there is a happy hour for guests  with wine| beer and a variety of snacks being provided at no charge. This is a very nice touch to the Hotel Giraffe. It also has an excellent rooftop bar| which is buzzy and well patronised. Or at least it was when I was there| although| having said that| the temperature in New York was up close to 40 degrees.  The rooms are not large but very comfortable| many with Juliet balconies and well appointed bathrooms.  Breakfast is a buffet| with sufficient choice but surprisingly for New York| good coffee. My wife had previously stayed in this hotel| so of course|…,
127,Very pleasant hotel,Very pleasant boutique hotel  lovely helpful staff Breakfast| coffee and early evening nibbles are served in the hotel foyer  Our bedroom and bathroom were  quite large for a New York hotel  Only slight downside for us was we were with friends who can't walk far so we had to taxi everywhere.,
24,The best NY Hotel !!!,The hotel was absolutely perfect! The room was clean and spacious| the service was excellent| the breakfast was great| the afternoon cheese buffe' is a great treat - a very nice way to end your day. The location is also perfect - 5 minute walk from a subway station| with lines that get you very fast to anywhere in Manhattan. In the hotel lobby you have a coffee machine and additional drinks (coffee| all sorts of tea| hot chocolate) and cakes which the hotel guests can enjoy 24/7. The service at the reception was out outstandingly friendly| and the room service was also outstanding| the gorgeous room was cleaned on a daily basis| and in addition - every evening we had a follow up making sure we have every thing we need. From now on - this is THE NY hotel for us. Highly…,
2,What a great find,I was looking for a place close to a client meeting and stumbled across Hotel Giraffe.  Rooms were clean and comfortable.  Loved the breakfast in the morning.  I'd stay here again.  Hotel staff was very nice and helpful too.  ,
1,Fantastic stay!,2nd time here. Booked due to great experience the first time didn't disappoint this time. Staff friendly and helpful. Room spotless. Breakfast and wine and cheese reception great. Location great for exploring,
83,Fantastic Second Visit,"With so many Hotels to choose from in New York it says something when this is our second visit to this particular Hotel.  The staff and very friendly| not just ""American"" friendly but super efficient| happy and go that extra mile to help even with simple requests.  Special mention goes to the wonderful Gabrielle who serves at the evening cheese and wine.  She is extremely proficient and friendly and a great conversationalist without being obtrusive.  Breakfast| while simple is more than ample to set you up for the day.  Hotel is very clean and has just about every amenity you need| best of all its complimentary.",
1,All round friendly service,Upon entering till departure| the hotel employees were at your service.  Kmowledabke| helpful always with a smile.  Breakfast and wine and cheese were relaxing and most enjoyable||a rare treat in NYC. Hotel|Girafee is a little gem hidden in NYC.  Highly recommended for anyine needing a peaceful stay. Clean| well proportioned rooms.  Gtreat hotel  ,
7,Really missed the mark on this one!,My family stayed at the Hotel Giraffe almost two weeks ago.  Based on the reviews by others| we had no hesitation about booking.  Sadly| our stay was rather disappointing.  We had booked a one bedroom king suite with balcony. Decor was very generic| it  was impossible to shut bathroom door without walking sideways| outlets near bed for charging were not easily accessible| and there was no television in the bedroom of the suite.  The biggest challenge for us| however| was upon returning from our day around 11:30 pm to our room|  our daughter flushed  the toilet  it had flooded the entire bathroom floor.  My husband rushed to shut off the water leading to the tank| as that was where the water was gushing from.  We notified the front desk crew| who sent the bellman| who determined…,
2,My favorite Hotel,This was our second stay at Hotel Giraffe.  We absolutely love it here.   The staff is extremely helpful and very friendly. We love the happy hour and continental breakfast. we will always choose this hotel over others if it is available!!,
1,487,Classy hotel,Finding and booking the Hotel Giraffe was one of the best travel decisions we have ever made. This is our second stay at this wonderful establishment and we are anxiously awaiting our next stay in a couple of months.  The ambiance is warm and welcoming| the lobby feels like a large living area in one's home. There are snacks throughout the day and of course an excellent breakfast and evening reception. The staff really makes this hotel special as they cannot do enough for the guests.   We love to stay in the Classic Suite which is so large for a NY hotel. The location is superb in a beautiful area for walking near Madison Square Park and close to 2 subway stops. Bravo Giraffe!!
499,Excellent all the way,This is my 1st time at the Giraffe hotel and it was a great experience. We had the suites and they are very comfortable and spacious. The bed is very comfortable and the service at the hotel is excellent. The bonus is a nice breakfast in the lobby where everything was good and fresh and the 5 o'clock wine and cheese. Very much recommended.,
1,Lovely| comfortable European style hotel,The rooms were comfortable| well-appointed| clean| and fairly quiet (for NYC). The service was very good and the staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast and wine and cheese in the lobby were lovely treats. I would strongly recommend Hotel Giraffe for business| solo| and couples. ,
4,Overrated,Giraffe is nice in a generic way| but it is really nothing special. The location is good| near restaurants and the subway. The lobby is bright but has chain-hotel furnishings. Staff was OK; doormen were uninterested in guests. My room was not what I expected as it had a open shower| barrier-free bathroom| which I did not request. In my experience| the setup allows water to splatter everywhere. So I asked to change rooms| but nothing was available without changing rooms during my stay. It was unfortunate that I was assigned a nonstandard room in the first place| but this was not a big deal. Bathroom: the small sink was awkwardly placed under a counter making it hard to use the taps. The shower pressure was good| but left huge pools of water which didn't properly drain.  The room…,
43,Excellent Midtown hotel,I stayed at Hotel Giraffe during a work trip after a friend recommended it to me. Because I was referred I received a slight discount--nice! When I called to book| I also told them my mother was traveling with me| and that it was her first time in New York City. When we arrived to our room| a bottle of wine and welcome card were there to greet us| great touch. Hotel has great amenities| especially the lobby happy hour where guests can enjoy free wine| cheese| and snacks| as well as free breakfast. Would recommend without hesitation.,
10,Fabulous hotel!,We recently stayed at the Hotel Giraffe| and loved it!  The location| at Park Ave and 26th Street| is very convenient| and the room was spacious and elegant.  We really enjoyed both the manager's reception and the continental breakfast| both included.  We will definitely stay at the Hotel Giraffe the next time we come to Manhattan!,
6,Excellent Hotel!,Stayed at the Giraffe for a week and was so pleased with the service| comfort| and value.  The morning continental breakfast was great - very tasty - as was the afternoon wine/champagne happy hour.  Rooms are very well cared for| comfortable| and relaxing.  Best part was location - Midtown.   Very convenient to all NYC sites.  Great restaurants very close by - including the hotel's restaurant downstairs....good Italian food.,
4,Love Hotel Giraffe,We love the Hotel Giraffe for three reasons: (1) convenient location close to Lexington Avenue Subway stops at 23rd street and 28th street; (2) competitive rates| especially if you pre-pay; and (3) great service| particularly in the lobby where complementary food and beverages are provided. I have enjoyed two stays and definitely will return.,
6,"Another fabulous stay at "" The Giraffe""",Have been going to New York for years and see no reason to stay anywhere else. The room was very clean and quiet even on the 3rd floor. Love the breakfast spread (maybe add Greek yogurt to the mix) and the wine and cheese late afternoon. Staff is great and very responsive.,
5,Back to the Giraffe,5th trip this year. Always first class friendly service[ excellent continental breakfast service; expresso| etc. free and available 24/7; wine & cheese afternoon happy hour| and free Wi-Fi. We stay here 6-7 times per year. What's not to like!,
34,Great Park Ave South location| nice hotel with breakfast,We traveled as a family of 4 & stayed in a room with 2 double beds. It was spacious and clean. We appreciated the buffet breakfast in the lobby. The clientele was worldly and every age. We walked to Eataly off Madison Park & caught cabs to the USOpen. I'd go back.,
11,No hesitation in recommending this hotel.,Forget the location| the inclusive cheese and wine after a long day's touristing| the very nice continental breakfast in the lobby. Forget the weirdly spacious room (for New York anyway) and the convenient location.   What really impressed me was how well the staff treated the guests. A bunch of smart| hardworking| capable and genuine people from all over the world  - the doorman  who cheerfully walked our luggage streets away because the avenue outside was blocked off for a festival - the lovely lady running the evening reception who always poured my wine and brought it over to this footsore tourist - the maid who sorted out my extra blanket so quickly.   Thank you| what a consistently wonderful attitude you have. I've never really seen that in any hotel| ever.,
265,The best NYC hotel,Stayed here for 6 nights as part of our silver anniversary holiday.  Had previously stayed in The Library Hotel (part of same group) which was excellent also.   From the moment we arrived| we were greeted with big smiles and made so welcome. This is an easy hotel to stay in. The staff take great care of you and the clientele are lovely too.  We were late checking in due to long immigration queues at JFK so it was wonderful when Gabriella greeted up with a couple of glasses of fine wine. A great start to our first evening. She takes amazing care of everyone at breakfast & wine time!  We have been to NYC a number of times before so it was a relaxed holiday for us. We had a wonderful light complimentary breakfast in the lobby each day. Good start to the day. Our room was spacious…,
4,Fabulous hotel,Stayed here back in mid-August... full of trepidation for the NYC part of US trip| as previous visits to the city had left me resigned to bland| impersonal hotels with very little to recommend them. Even more terrified this time as I was coming with my children!  Hotel Giraffe breaks the mould. Super communication from the front desk team| right from the very first enquiry email. On arrival| the team were hugely friendly and helpful- and that was the way it stayed... every single member of staff we met during a 4 night visit was superb. Always cheerful| always hugely helpful.  The set-up of the hotel| with the communal lounge for breakfast| and early evening drinks| works wonderfully well in a big city. It never feels overpowering| and it is always relaxing. Who knew you could…,
31,Great Stay in NYC,From the moment we arrived at the Giraffe we felt attended to.  We stayed 7 nights and the staff was always available to tend to our needs. Always a perfectly cleaned room| welcoming doorman| great food staff| and helpful reception. JR at reception was great booking Wicked the broadway show for me| 9/11 memorial tickets and looked after our airport transportation. Gabby was always smiling and happy to bring free happy hour drinks to our table once we arrived from a busy day out! Free breakfast was also a bonus. Great stay and location.,
10,Best property on NYC,The staff at this hotel is the friendliest and most efficient anywhere in the city!  I didn't leave or return without the doorman welcoming me and asking if I needed anything before I left.  The staff at breakfast and happy hour were on the level of high end restaurants.  The room was clean and on the bigger side (for NYC)...,
3,Best place to stay in NYC,Great location in the Flatirons District. Good subway connection nearby. Great breakfast included. And wonderful wine and cheese in the evening. Great roof top bar also. The staff are the best part of staying here. Really make the place great.,
5,Kostas & Frida Wedding ceremony on rooftop garden!,We choose this hotel for our wedding because we like the rooftop garden view. Emily White Lyman the director of meetings & special events help us to prepare everything till the wedding time. During the ceremony she stay with us to make sure that everything going well! The wedding was great. She put a wedding greeting card to our room with beautiful wishes from her and team of the hotel. Thank you Emily for everything!! The service from the hotel was excellent!! We recommend Hotel Giraffe to everyone for your stay.   Kostas & Frida,
54,STILL THE BEST,We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights at the end of July / beginning of August| having stayed there in before in May.  Sometimes| going back to places you remember fondly just disappoints ... not this hotel.  For us| the fabric of the hotel and the food naturally is important| but what makes one hotel stand out from another is the staff and customer service.  That's where the Giraffe excels.  Without exception| every single one of the customer facing staff is friendly| helpful| and go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable.  This is now our go-to hotel in New York ... I can't imagine it will decline while the people who work there remain.,
8,Fantastic Hotel,We chose this hotel because we love giraffes and it looked great. We were not disappointed. Everything about it was lovely. We stayed for ten nights. We liked the fact it was a small establishment and very very friendly. The staff were brilliant - especially Gabriella| nothing  was too much trouble. The cheese and wine at 5pm was a lovely touch. Another massive plus point for this hotel was that breakfast was included. This was very well presented and a good choice every day considering they didn't have a great deal of space! Room was very clean. probably the easiest and most effective  air con we have ever seen in a hotel! Brilliant location. We loved Madison Square Park which is very close by. Would stay again without hesitation.,
1,Our go to place in NYC,This was our third stay at the Hotel Giraffe. We stay here because we prefer its understated but well-appointed and quiet rooms. The beds are extremely comfortable| they have a turn-down service every evening and everyone on-staff is extremely professional and courteous. They also have a nice continental breakfast and wine and cheese happy hour in the late afternoon which comes with the price of the room. Finally| the hotel is only two blocks from the #6 subway line  and only a few blocks from the R and W lines which makes it extremely convenient to go anywhere in Manhattan. We have always enjoyed our stay at The Giraffe.,
1,Best Hotel in NYC!,"This is my favorite hotel for myriad reasons. The location at 26th and Park is ideal for me. The rooms are spacious and beautiful and I love the little balcony in many of them. If you forget a sundry item| they provide all the basics gratis. (plus many ""comfort"" items are complimentary.) Every day| in their beautiful lobby| they have a fabulous continental breakfast| a wine and cheese gathering in the afternoon| and coffee| cookies and pastries 24 hours!  Plus| the staff is top notch!  Everyone is wonderful and they completely cater to their guests. I would never stay anywhere else!",
302,Lovely boutique hotel.,Stayed one night| staff was wonderful| and even though  we were on the 6 th floor we were still getting a lot of traffic noise| but slept through the night. Lobby staff were great. Lewis held our luggage while we went to lunch and when we came back| in the rain| he caught my husband mid fall getting out of the cab. Nice man. Very helpful getting us cabs. Room and bathroom are very large| by NY standards. Continental breakfast was lovely| will return to this lovely hotel when we are back in NY.,
54,Cute Boutique Hotel,This hotel is located not far from the magnificent Flatiron Building. The hotel offers a lot of extra amenities including bathrobes| slippers and special pillows. Our room even had a balcony. A very nice Continental breakfast and nightly wine and cheese reception makes for a very nice stay. We enjoyed our stay and will return. ,
3,Lovely hotel| friendly staff,"From the moment we arrived the staff couldn't have been nicer. Both Manuel and Nick at the front desk helped us find just the right restaurant we were looking for. What my daughter and I enjoy about the Hotel Giraffe and all the Library hotels is their complimentary breakfast and evening wine and cheese. Gabriella couldn't have been a better hostess. While she remembered us each night/ day of our stay I was most impressed that there were guests she remembered from previous visits a year ago. My only disappointment was on the morning that Gabby was not there| the other three hostesses were too ""busy"" to make any speciality coffees| I.e.| lattes| cappuccinos. They only offered coffee and tea| covering the machines capability to do these beverages. ",
5,This our go to hotel the we are in NYC,We love this hotel| we keep coming back time an time again.  Front desk is always friendly and helpful. The breakfast is nice| a quiet room.  The gal at the evening cocktail hour remembers us year after year..  My only complaint (and most hotels have the problem) is the the blankets are too heavy/warm for the summer. The air conditioner has to be turned down too low. Free water is great.,
14,Always amazing,This is my 4th visit to Hotel Giraffe. Nothing else to say but I love it here.  Perfect location for business or holiday travellers. Brilliant staff| especially Gabby | the breakfast girls and house keeping. Rooms are spacious and well designed| beds| linen and pillows are oh so comfy. I cant fault it. Dont wait...book it now!!,
2,A lovely respite,As a repeat visitor| I highly recommend Hotel Giraffe. The staff is very accommodating and positive. The suite ( same both visits) was beautiful allowing for a relaxing stay as well as the ability to get some work done without feeling cooped up. The balcony out on to Park Avenue gives the suite an even larger sense. The lobby tea time| and breakfast were a nice way to meet other people. It is a calm and pleasant setting with unobtrusive but attentive  service. ,
21,All round great ,We stayed as family of 3 in a king suite. Room was excellent and the suite bedroom could be isolated from the living area/sofa bed via a door. Quality of fixtures fittings linen and room facilities etc was to a high standard. Staff were probably the nicest of anywhere we've ever stayed. Every day they offer cheese and wine complimentary and you can drink as much as you wish. We only visited the roof space once and found the bar closed at 9pm which was our only small criticism| however the local area has several nice bars and places to eat. The location of the hotel was perfect for seeing the sights and we felt very safe in this up and coming neighbourhood. If we return to NY we would stay here again.,
6,Comfortable| Friendly & Relaxed,I could not recommend this hotel more highly. It includes breakfast (fruit| yoghurt| toast| bagels| boiled eggs| pastries| tea| coffee| fruit juice etc) of which you can have as much or as little as you feel like & the staff serving are very obliging. Breakfast being included was a great help price wise & time wise for getting up & out. Every evening they have complimentary cheese & wine/prosecco from 5-8 pm in the very pleasant reception area with someone playing the piano. It has a rooftop garden. The reception staff are all extremely knowledgeable| helpful| courteous & friendly| Jose & Cody were who we dealt with in particular. It's situated near the flat iron building which is beside Madison Square Park.  It's not far to the ESB and handy for subways etc. There are some…,
10,My adopted home away from home!,I planned a #GirlstTrip2017 for my daughters and myself over the weekend and picked Hotel Giraffe for it's location and my past positive experiences with the place. I was of course| not disappointed! One daughter lives a few blocks away from this property| the other flew out with me to visit New York sister. She was very impressed by our beautiful spacious room| full of comfort and amenities| as well as the welcoming smiles and service from the moment our car pulled up to the curb.We gathered in the lounge downstairs and felt like we were in a lovely living room| great wine| snacks| and piano playing. Gabriella| the FABULOUS hostess/waitress/everything| actually recognized me| remembered my New York daughter and my husband who wasn't with us! I felt like we were staying with…,
108,5 great nights,This would have to be one of my favourite hotels anywhere. The staff were amazing. The desk staff and door staff always friendly and helpful . Don't miss the happy hour . Our hostess Gabrielle is the best. We had some drinks on the rooftop as well which was very relaxed. It's close to transport and the room was extremely comfortable . Recommended.,
80,A home from home in NYC,Great central location| friendly and attentive staff| accommodation symbolises understated class| feels peaceful amongst the noise and bustle of Manhattan.  Wine and cheese at 5pm| relaxed buffet breakfast in the lobby too| and plenty of returning and loyal customers.   Whenever I am in New York| I will make this my place to stay whether for shopping| business| culture or sport,
65,Lovely Hotel in a Great Location,This hotel group does it right and The Giraffe is no exception. I am a return visitor and will make The Giraffe my temporary home again in the future. The staff are wonderful| nothing is too much trouble. This especially includes the breakfast staff| who provide bright and cheery smiles every morning along with great service. The rooms are spacious for a large city city like New York| the bathrooms luxurious.The location is conveniently located in a mixed residential/commercial area. The subway and buses are only a couple of blocks away and there are a number of fine restaurants within walking distance.  I highly recommend The Giraffe.,
32,Nice Boutique Hotel in Manhattan,I booked this hotel because of its location| price| and accommodation. By paying in full| in advance| I allegedly saved 20% (book directly with the property). Total stay for two nights| mid-week| King Superior| was $706.38| inclusive of taxes. As a jaded New Yorker| this inflated rate felt like a deal. The room was well appointed| furniture run-of-the-mill but serviceable. Curtains and shades were tattered and worn| air conditioners rattled. Bed was comfortable| pillows were abundant. Bathroom was clean and tidy - hot water was very hot and water pressure was excellent. I was in room 201 - which is right above the street. Noise from late night pedestrians made it hard to fall asleep| 3:00 AM garbage collection right under the window was jarring| and early morning traffic/honking…,
127,New Favorite Hotel in NYC,I've stayed at many high end hotels in NYC. The Giraffe is my new favorite. The rooms are large| comfortable| clean and quiet. Also| the staff is friendly and the location is great.   The giraffe is a fairly small hotel| which is nice because there aren't long waits for elevators or crowds in the lobby like at other hotels. I'd highly recommend staying here!,
28,Sanctuary!!,New York is brilliant but it's loud| busy|frantic and more. Hotel Giraffe is a calm oasis| the hotel is spotlessly clean| the staff are lovely| the rooms spacious and have everything you could possibly want including a fridge. It is also unpretentious| coffee| tea| water| biscuits and pastries are available all day every day at no extra cost| and wine cheese and nibbles from 5pm until 8pm at no extra cost was amazing.  It's not right in the middle of all the hollerballo but we were very happy with that| there's a lovely restaurant attached to the hotel and enough good eating places within 5 minutes walk if you don't want to go to far in the evening after trekking the sites during the day.,
8,Great stay for family of 6,Great location. Could return rental car to Budget 3 blocks away. Had small breakfast options in the lobby- cereal| yogurt| bagels. Rooms were clean| beds comfortable. No issues at all. Hotel staff was helpful and friendly.,
16,Loved Hotel Giraffe - can't wait to return,Our party of two adults and one teenager stayed one night in early July before flying overseas.  We agree with all of the great reviews on the staff's kindness and attentiveness.  We had a lovely time at their wine and cheese time in the afternoon and what a great continental breakfast the following morning.  The staff was so warm and helpful - always asking if we needed anything.  They held our luggage the next day| called a taxi for us and loaded our luggage for us.  The location is convenient| many restaurants nearby| and only a 15 minute walk to Times Square.  What a great experience - I can say that this will be our first choice on future trips to New York.,
1,Overnight Stay at Hotel Giraffe,Haven't stayed at the Hotel in 15 years when they first opened their doors. It was awesome 15 years ago...........And it was awesome again. Great accommodations| friendly and helpful staff and the location is awesome.,
166,Gem on Park Avenue,This boutique hotel is situated on 25th street and Park Avenue| is close to the subway and cabs are very easy to find.  We had the pleasure of staying in a suite and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  I must admit the continental breakfast and happy hour is excellent.  Plenty of fresh| quality ingredients and the daily pastry/coffee/fresh fruit is excellent.  A special shout out to Gabriella who took very good care of us during happy hour.  The staff is personable| professional| and very pleasant to deal with.  Plenty of dining options nearby and the infamous shake shack is only a couple of blocks away!,
18,hard to beat,This hotel is a real find. Great location and very friendly staff. Good clean and large rooms. Great breakfast and the early evening wine and cheese a treat. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this hotel. I actually left my passports and some cash in the hotel and they found it ( I hadn't realised) and sent it by courier to where I was having lunch! They are prepared to go the extra mile to help. I would highly recommend this hotel.,
5,Gem of NYC,Fabulous boutique hotel . From the moment you checked in to our check out we were greeted with kindness and attentiveness. Wine & Cheese as well as breakfast and additional treats through out the day were also served with a personal touch. Even the personal note and treat in our room made us feel like VIPs. Our room was super clean and loved the comfy bed & linens! Will definitely be back and do recommend for all who want a great boutique personal experience in the heart of NYC!,
10,very good hotel| i recommand it,very good welcome| very professionnal. i liked the lounge and the breakfast included in my bill. I'll surely come back. the rooms size are ok and the bathroom too. it is in the center of every thing...,
5,Outstanding hotel,"We have been searching for that great boutique hotel in Manhattan| that can be our ""base"" when we visit. We found it in Giraffe. The staff| amenities| services were all first rate. The location is central to multiple activities and restaurants. We look forward to our next visit.",
18,Beautiful| friendly hotel,I loved the Hotel Giraffe! Beautiful rooms| high ceilings| little library in each room| and excellent location. Loved that breakfast was included| and I had it brought to my room for only $5 extra. Wonderful| friendly staff too!,
3,Loved it,Great place to stay! Beautiful experience! Great customer service! We really enjoyed our stay and the staff took great care of Is! The location was perfect and the weather was beautiful! Couldn't have asked for a better spot!  ,
35,Absolutely Spot On!,We chose Hotel Giraffe because of the reviews on Tripadvisor and got exactly what we hoped for| and then some more (outlined at the end).  I cannot stress enough| this hotel is superb. Everything about it delivers.y  We had six nights at the beginning of August and felt so| so welcome throughout.  The staff are all super friendly| from the doormen| reception| housemaids| lovely breakfast girls and of course the absolute delight that is Gabriella.  What a treasure and asset to the hotel she is. She makes everyone so welcome and caters individually for all. No one feels left out with Gabriella.   Our suite was spotless.  The housemaids are so discrete and hardly visible but cheerful if you do spot them. The beds large and comfortable and the pillows plentiful and heavenly.  So…,
2,NYC Place to Stay,We stayed at the Hotel Giraffe at the end of July 2017 and loved our experience.  The location was perfect for seeing all the sites of NYC| the staff were exceptional especially Gabbie (Front Desk) who was out point of contact for all places to go and eat and also the lady who served us our breakfast and afternoon drinks.  She was so friendly and welcoming every time.  What a great experience we had| thank you.  Highly recommended.,
48,Back Again,Upon leaving the hotel this last time| I thought - If I had a month to spend in NYC| I would stay at the Giraffe.  From the welcome to the afternoon party to the breakfast - just wonderful! Absolutely love this place.,
53,Absolutely fabulous hotel and location brilliant,We loved our stay at this hotel.  It is luxurious whilst at the same time managing to be friendly. It does not have that large anonymous feeling of so many five star hotels. The bedroom was well laid out; the beds and pillows very comfortable. Considering it is in the middle of New York| it was not too noisy. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and service excellent. The lounge was a truly communal area with drinks and pastries/cookies available all day at no charge. This meant that people sit| read books and chat. So much better than being stuck in a hotel bedroom. The free cheese and wine in the early evening was generous and the hostess remembered our preferences after one night. Breakfast was a buffet and suited our European tastes. The location is a short walk to the…,
13,Fantastic Hotel in the heart of NYC.,We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights last week & can't speak more highly of it. Excellent staff who couldn't have been more helpful & pleasant to deal with. Great location & really spacious| beautifully decorated room. Very good breakfast & an evening happy hour of wine & cheese which are included in the very reasonable (especially for NYC) tariff. It will defiantly be our first choice when we're next in NYC & will be recommending this great hotel to anyone we know traveling to this fabulous city.,
15,Hotel Excellence.....,It's always a concern when reading reviews on TripAdvisor and sometimes you have to filter and take a risk.....you have no such worries with this hotel.  Positives- large rooms| (not normal for NYC our room on second floor resembled a UK suite). Attentive staff| great location| afternoon wine and cheese were a lovely touch. Coffee and fruit available in reception 24hrs a day. All elements of stay excellent very difficult to criticise.  Negative- have one but didn't really cause any issues| street noise. Our floor was close to the street so traffic noise may upset some guests. I am comfortable wearing ear plugs so no problem| my wife (who always sleeps well!) slept through the noise.  Hotel provide all sorts of little handy items including ear plugs free of charge if you forget…,
1,Relax,Excelente location near very good restaurantes and shops. Walking distance from the soho| high park and  parks The sheets and the pillows are excellent. The people who works there are super nice| you fill like at  Home The breakfast is good and the cocktails in the afternoon are excellent.Specially Gabriela who is no nice ,
4,We LOVE theGiraffe!,The Staff alone made our stay spectacular. The Hotel is clean. The rooms are large for NYC| The beds are luxuriously comfortable. The rooftop is relaxing. The lobby| fun| & the location allows for easy access to all areas of the city. We took the subway everywhere| & walked every district| including the Brooklyn Bridge & Central Park. Oh| & they offer valley parking. Perfection| particularly the Staff!,
7,A GEM OF A FIND,The Giraffe is a great hotel with great service| great accomodations| great breakfast (included)| and a great happy hour including apps| wine and champagne. You do not get this service for this price anywhere in NYC.  Do yourself a favor and give it a try| you won't be disappointed.  ,
34,Fantastic hotel!,We recently stayed at Hotel Giraffe for 7 nights and what a treat it was. This hotel is fabulous. We had a king size room with a separate living area and a very spacious bathroom with plenty of counter top space and huge mirrors. The rooms were kept extremely clean throughout our stay. The big windows were a bonus to let in extra light as the rooms are a little dark. The staff at the reception desk were very helpful and able to answer any question we had. The night duty manager even assisted me at 4:30am when our driver did not arrive for a tour we had booked into. He made calls for us to the tour company to ensure we would be picked up and not miss out on the tour.  The breakfast provided in the lobby is a perfect start to the day - bagels| toast| fruit| cereals| pastries|…,
3,Beautiful holiday,Nice boutique hotel. Perfect location. Clean and cosy. Very good service. Helpful and careful staff. Good breakfast. Fantastic cheese and wine testing before dinner. Beautiful roof terrace. Our room was a bit dark.,
5,Great boutique hotel,Can't say enough about this well located hotel.  Nice size rooms with plenty of storage and outlets.  Nice bathroom with plenty of space for toiletries.  Terrific and attentive staff.  Loved having the little terrace.  Would definitely book again!,
57,An exceptional stay,"This is not a cheap hotel| but so worth the cost.  We were on a special vacation and wanted to be pampered.  They rose to the occasion in so many ways.  We were obliged in many special requests. We were given extra glasses of wine to take up to the roof garden even when happy hour was done| for instance.  Our niece and her fiance came to meet us in the lobby andwere treated so kindly.  When we wanted breakfast in our room| the staff rallied to find us a tray and all we could want. The only down sides: - my wife's shoes disappeared mysteriously for a day (they had been swept under the ottoman by the staff) - the coffee is really sub-par (the ""extra shot"" latte is just a machine latte with an extra blurp of regular coffee)",
1,Giraffe,Superb property| convenient for my meetings| room was beautiful| spacious| bathroom well kept and clean| staff very professional and accommodating| free breakfast in the morning was delightful. We will be back ,
2,Simply PErfect,Perfect beds| free breakfast| free happy hour and small.  I don't think there's 7 rooms per floor so the most guests at the hotel is 60 at a time.  It's modern motif and the rooms are small| but it's a very sexy place to stay.  And the location..... WOW.  Right next to the most important subway.... the 4|5 and 6 will take you just about anywhere.... even brooklyn (Barclays Center).,
14,BEST HOLIDAY EVER!!!!!,I don't know why I didn't do a review at the time but I can honestly say there is hardly a day goes past that I don't think about this special week in my life!! The month I visited was actual October 2015. The review bar doesn't go back that far! We came as a family of 7 to celebrate my 60th birthday which happened while we were in New York!  We researched hotels in New York for ages before booking as I wanted everything to be so perfect. My husband and daughter planned it all but I had an input with the hotel as they know how fussy I am! I couldn't have chosen a better hotel....... it was so perfect! The breakfast was so good| and if we happened to be around in the afternoon the cheese and wine was so civilised. There wasn't one member of staff that didn't go over and above to…,
3,Great hotel,We enjoyed our stay at this hotel.  From checking in to all the amenities the hotel offered were top notch.  I would definitely book again.  The refreshments and wine and cheese was a great touch.  The breakfast was wonderful.  Great location too!! ,
28,Great | cool small hotel in the Flatiron District,"Bright| airy modern style hotel Just off lower Park Ave at 26 st. Great location for business or touristing around NY. The entire property has a clean| new| airy feel. From the lobby where a very nice continental breakfast is included in your rate. Happy hour every PM there as well.  Easy | fast smiling  check in. Big room with a balcony overlooking Park Ave where everything worked the way it should from the electric drapes to the convenient electrical outlets  on the desk.Nice size bathroom. No stall shower but it works fine. Couple blocks from Madison Square Park. Plenty restaurants form casual to fine in the neighborhood ( it's NYC OK?). A definite ""go back"" for me",
50,Fantastic hotel in every way,We are a family of three and stayed 3 nights in a King Suite at The Giraffe during our recent 2.5 week trip around the east coast of the US.  It was without doubt the best hotel of our trip.  Everything about the Giraffe was perfect - the location| the room| the fresh breakfast| the cheese and wine at the end of the day| the reasonable price.  But what really stood out for us was the exceptional customer service| from every member of staff we encountered.  Thanks for a wonderful stay.,
86,Wonderful Staff only added to the great hotel.,Our room was a good size for a boutique hotel in New York.  We had a sitting room along with the bedroom.  I was a little concerened about the road noise| but once the curtains were closed we didn't hear a thing.  Staff were very attentive to our every want and need.  Reservations were taken care of well in advance of our stay.  My only regret is that we didn't have more time to spend in this hotel.  We will return to Hotel Giraffe next time we stay in NY.,
3,Excellent Service and Great Location,When I reserved the suite| I had informed the reception that there will be 3 of us.  I was impressed when we walked into our room that the  sofa bed in the living room was already made.  There is also a welcome note from management and the team.  Reception was also friendly and helpful,
9,Love this hotel,This is the second time we've stayed here.  It's small and very friendly.  The rooms are very nice and quiet.  It was a welcome respite from the hub-bub of the city and a short walk from the subway.  Very convenient.,
6,Great stay at Hotel Giraffe,My husband and I stayed at Hotel Giraffe for 5 nights in June and we're so pleased we picked this hotel.  We were greeted warmly| our room was spacious| clean and comfortable and it was quiet (for NY)! They had very kindly left a card and complimentary bottle of sparkling wine for us to enjoy since it was a trip for our 10th wedding anniversary.  The wine and cheese afternoons were a great added extra and filled a gap between sightseeing and nightlife! We didn't use the rooftop bar| but it looked like it would be a pleasant place to have a drink. The location of this hotel was brilliant| enabling us to get up to central park and down to the financial district/across to Brooklyn easily.  We walked everywhere but there are subway stations close by.  There is an abundance of…,
2,Wonderful for our Faily,We really had a great time here.  Our two daughters loved it (ages 9 and 4).  Our suite was spacious and very clean.  It was quiet.  We really enjoyed the breakfast and snacks throughout the day.  The staff was friendly and very helpful- helped us with our car| during crazy street closures| and were great to deal with.,
12,Return Stay,My husband and I stayed at The Hotel Giraffe in October 2010 and loved it so much there wasn't even a question where we would stay this trip| and once again the Hotel Giraffe exceeded our expectations. Friendly staff| spacious rooms| beautiful roof top terrace and great location. We totally loved our second stay here!,
1,Excellent experience in Hotel Giraffe by Library Hotel Collection NYC,For a short time of staying this place was perfect for me and accommodate me and my needs! Located in Midtown Manhattan/NY| accessible to many attraction places| entertainment and transportation around the city. The room with a small balcony| was cosy and quiet| just what I need it after a busy day. The bed and the mattress very comfy and clean.  The employees| staff from front desk| concierges| hotel maids| absolutely friendly| professional and helpful. Great service. In the hotel lobby complimentary wine and cheese every afternoon. Love it! It was worth every penny| I found the price for this Hotel being reasonable. No complaints whatsoever. Great Hotel! I will definitely stay in this hotel on my next trip to Manhattan/NY. Thank you for the warm welcome and hospitality! ,
126,Good Value & Convenient Location,We were in town with our 2 teen age kids and 2 other sets of family for a wedding in Brooklyn.  Having lived in Manhattan for 13 years| we know our way around.  Hotel Giraffe was a perfect location.  It is very close to the green subway line (6) and only took 15 minutes by Uber to get to the Brooklyn wedding.  We had activities planned both downtown (911 museum) and Uptown (Central Park).  Hotel Giraffe was in the middle.  Was also walking distance to many good restaurants and Times Square| Grand Central| Madison Square Park| Bryant Park| etc.  We love to travel and know how hard it is to find a hotel room that is clean and has 2 queen beds so that a family of 4 can share 1 room since 2 rooms is obviously more costly.  So| the double queen room with a balcony was perfect for our…,
1,Great stay,We simply loved our stay in the Giraffe Hotel. It was perfect form arrival till departure. Rooms were spacious and always very tidy. Wine and Cheese before dinner or for closing the day was terrific and especially the service and attention of the Gabriela and the staff at breakfast was wonderful. Will definitely come back. Kudos to all.,
14,Great Hotel in Flatiron,We stayed as a family of 5 in a double suite corner room with fantastic views down Park Avenue. This hotel has a great formula - fantastic service with a boutique feel. Everyone was very helpful and the wine and cheese in the evening a lifesaver after a hard day pounding the streets of NYC.,
123,A Perfect Gem of a Hotel,We have stayed at the Hotel Giraffe several times and will never stay anywhere else in NYC. It is a real gem of a hotel| with beautifully appointed rooms| comfortable beds| and every possible amenity. Staff members are all friendly and accommodating. We enjoy the continental breakfast and the afternoon wine and cheese. Overall| a delightful place to stay and at a reasonable price. Highly recommend.,
4,Hotel experience,This is my favorite hotel to stay at when visiting New York. You usually receive a bottle of wine in your room but this didn't happen the past two times. The staff are all kind and very helpful. I love drinking lounge in the lobby. Gabby the server is amazing- she remembers all the people and their choice of wine. This is in a convenient location to shopping tourist sites and restaurants. ,
4,2 in a row,Our second stay was just as great as the first and we will definitely stay at the Hotel Giraffe again. From the comfortable room to the attentive staff to the overall appearance of the facility| all so wonderful. Thanks so much!!,
59,Once again a seamless| perfect stay,I have stayed here twice this year so far and each time it has been great. Staff is professional| housekeeping does a great job and the breakfast and evening wine service are stellar. Have only one small complaint - rooms are a bit dark for my old eyes. Love this place. I will be back !,
31,One of the best in NYC,One of the nicest and largest rooms I've stayed in in NYC - and excellent value for the money. Not only was the hotel lovely but the staff was friendly and very accommodating. I would highly recommend the Giraffe!,
2,Just what we were looking for,After arriving VERY early from our Cruise ship the entire staff was outstanding. They accommodated us from the second we arrived. From the front desk to the bellman to the wine and cheese server throughout our entire stay| everyone was terrific. The rooms are quite nice. Quite what you would expect from a well rated boutique hotel| but the rooms were much more sizable compared to a standard NYC hotel. It is situated in a great area. Within walking distance you will find plenty to eat and drink. We recommend Marta| located on 29th Street. Also| The Little Beet| located on Park Ave. just a couple blocks away. Every night they serve complimentary wine and cheese (among other snacks) in the lobby. Absolutely wonderful for a gathering of sorts| if you wish. The rooftop lounge has…,
89,Fantastic hotel,We were looking for a centrally located small boutique type hotel from Manhattan and based on some reviews in the internet we chose Hotel Giraffe. That turned out to be the perfect choise. It's located on 26th street and Park avenue with excellent connections to both uptown and downtown. The personnel is friendly and helpful without being too pushy| which is a skill in it self. The hotel is stylish and in excellent condition and rooms are very convenient and spaceous. Hotel is offering a breakfast and wine and cheese every evening in the lobby and on working days there is also piano music. All services were performed skillfully and efficiently and small wishes which we had were executed immediately. Hotel doesn't have an own restaurant but they are  connected to restaurant Bread…,
35,Unusual offer| great staff and central (but quiet) location made for a great stay,Stayed here for four nights with a family of four.  Staff were friendly and helpful| organising car to pick us up from the airport| helicopter ride round NYC and advice on places to go and how to get about. As this was our first time in NYC and we were not here for long| this was most helpful.   Of course| you would expect any decent hotel to do this| but the staff did so in a caring and interested way and were a pleasure to deal with.  Breakfast comprises cereal| fruit| bagels (very good) etc. and is a relaxing affair in the hotel's seating area.   The unusual part of the offer is the cheese and wine served every night between 5 and 7 - included in the price| this is a real treat after a day of sightseeing.  The staff running the food offer| as with those on reception| are both…,
103,Perfect in every way,We were a family of 3 who stayed here in July| we booked to stay in the king suite| and were upgraded to the King balcony suite. It was perfect in every way... perfect room| perfect view| perfect location| perfect breakfast and most of all| extremely helpful staff. They answered all my emails swiftly| and fulfilled all of our requests| including putting a mattress topper on the pullout bed| which made it very comfortable. Going out on the roof terrace on our first night in New York was just magical!,
1,Amazing staff/location,My girlfriend and I did a quick stay in NY| and we decided to check out Hotel Giraffe on the recommendation of my sister.  We arrived at 10am| way too early to check in| but the staff took our bags and offered their breakfast service even though we weren't supposed to check in until 3pm.  Everyone we spoke with was professional and extremely helpful.  When we returned to the hotel after walking around the city| our bags were delivered to our room| and a bottle of wine was waiting for us!  The room was beautiful and clean| and we were able to enjoy the wine on the balcony before heading to Brooklyn for dinner.  If we ever make it back to the City| we will be looking up Hotel Giraffe for sure.,
182,Best location for visiting New York,This hotel just gives and gives and gives.  Absolutely love it ‼️ Perfectly positioned near Times Square| quite centrally located and not far from Central Park | The Met| Empire State Building| World Trade Centre.  Lovely boutique hotel with free wifi |free breakfast |free wine & cheese 5-8pm nightly | free tea coffee biscuits sweets fruit 24/7 ...... what else could you want.   Very clean | well priced for location and wonderful friendly staff.  Truely wonderful experience. We coming back again next week ‼️,
57,Great hotel at great location ,Very nice Hotel perfectly located at park avenue and 26th. Subway station just two blocks away. Staff very friendly. Good breakfast served every morning and whine and cheese every late afternoon. Rooms are quite big for NYC standards.,
1,Unreal,We went to NYC to get married and after reading the many great reviews we decided I'm on hotel giraffe. We were not disappointed| the rooms are spacious| breakfast was great not to mention the wine and cheese reception every evening. The staff couldn't have been more helpful| especially the concierge who were able to answer all our questions and always had a smile and a bit of craic for us. Would definitely stay here again if we are ever back in NYC,
40,Favorite Hotel in NYC,The Hotel Giraffe is by far our favorite hotel in NYC.  We have travelled to New York for business and pleasure many times and having found the Giraffe we will never stay elsewhere. We most recently stayed in February 2017 and are on our way back later this month. The staff is awesome.  We stayed in in king suite which was quite large by New York standards.,
22,Great Hotel,I took my 17 and 19 year old grandkids. We spent 5 nights/ The hotel was in a good location for taxis and subway. The staff was very helpful. I like a smaller hotel and would recommend this hotel to anyone.,
4,Great Location & Staff,My wife and I spent 3 nights between July 27-30. This is a wonderful small hotel with a fantastic staff. The breakfast served was a great start to the day as well as happy hour to wrap the day up.   The location is central and provides a good launching point to all the key destinations.  A great value and a clean small hotel. We will stay there again.,
170,Great stay in NYC,Not the least expensive by any means| but you do get what you pay for at Hotel Giraffe. This was our 3rd visit.  Rooms are very well appointed and extremely clean.  The bathrooms are as well. The common areas are very inviting to stop and relax after a day trudging around Manhattan.  Best kept secret is the nightly hors d'oeuvres.  Great snack before supper.  A little wine| a little cheese| a few nuts... excellent to take the edge off before heading out to dine. The lady serving the cocktails was a real pleasure and made the experience even more pleasant.  Even outside the 5-8pm hors d'oeuvres| you can always find cold water| cookies| coffee and tea.  The continental breakfast was also a nice surprise.  Same server went above and beyond.  I hope the managers recognize the level…,
1,Awesome hotel,Great location.  Everybody we dealt with on the staff was attentive and nice.  Happy hour every night was a nice touch.  It would be nice to be able to have a hot breakfast but they did offer a fair number of options.,
46,Would be hard to beat,Good locations abound in NYC and this is a great location but the generous breakfast and wine and cheese and the exceptional staff take it to 5 star.  Gabriella was wonderful but also the other staff are excellent.  We tried the rooftop bar (should be better known with non guests)| the housekeeping and desk people were all really helpful and great hosts. Having breakfast reading the New York Times then coming back for prosecco while the pianist plays! Fabulous way to visit NYC. We were there 7 nights and nothing faltered at all.,
2,Our vacation was perfect because of this hotel!,"My husband and I visit New York every July. We chose to stay at the Hotel Giraffe for the first time. It was a great location| the rooms were wonderful and the complimentary breakfast and manager's cocktail hours were a delightful experience. The hotel employee from the Czech republic was a delight! By the second night| she knew everyone's drink order! Now| alas| I'm back at work and wishing someone would hand me a glass of Prosecco at 5 p.m.  We had a king balcony room facing Park Avenue. It was--not surprising--loud with the balcony doors open but lovely to be able to ""take in"" all of NYC| including sounds and smells!  We are now huge fans and will be back soon!",
12,Customer Service taken to the Highest Level,This hotel is a little gem in the big city of New York. Hotel Giraffe's is in an absolutely perfect location for visiting all areas of NY. The bedrooms are immaculate| especially the Suites. Perfect for relaxing after a busy day exploring the sites and shops. Customer Service is taken to a different level at the Hotel Giraffe. The Hotel Staff excel. The Giraffe Team are all genuinely friendly| welcoming| and helpful. This Team is truly inspirational. Thank you Team Giraffe!,
3,Five stars! Just BOOK IT!,This hotel is awesome. Wine and Cheese Reception is amazing! Who does not like to relax and enjoy being served wine and cheese by awesome people? Also the breakfast same way - served with amazing service! We had king room and we thoroughly enjoyed it! Rooftop bar is also great..Everyone at the hotel gives you great service! We went for anniversary and were pleasantly by surprised by complimentary Prosciutto!! If something is not right (which won't happen) just ask them - they genuinely try to accommodate your requests!,
83,Loved the hotel,Great location near parks| restaurants and subway stops plus area is not so crowded with people| wonderful staff especially ladies serving breakfast and evening wine who were so very nice| well laid out room| bathroom| and beds were great. My family all loved the hotel. ,
3,Wonderful experience during the entire stay.,"We stayed in this hotel for four nights during our summer vacation to New York City. I have to say this hotel really lives up to its reputation. Our experience was simply terrific. The hotel;s midtown location is very convenient| and the rooms are extremely comfortable| very like the rooms in many other boutique hotels in the city. But it is all the extra touches that make this hotel spectacular. Delicious espresso or a biscotti to nibble on any time of the day or night| a totally unexpected| totally classy wine and cheese reception every evening| an umbrella stand to help yourself from if it is raining outside| and the always smiling| always welcoming service of every single employee at this hotel were all ""wow"" amenities for us. The only reason we would stay in any other hotel…",
48,Amazing staff/great hotel,Stayed for a week. Staff could not be more helpful if they tried| did whatever they could for us| provided excellent advice on places to eat in the area and would organise cabs| book venues etc etc. could not rate them highly enough.  This is a hotel that will not disappoint you. Rooms are very good size| very clean| and beds are great. Have drinks and nibbles free each night| which gives you a perfect opportunity to meet other guests in a very friendly environment. Fruit| ice water tea and coffee are available from the front of the hotel 24/7. Breakfast is excellent| plenty of healthy choices. Location is really good. Just out of the peak tourist zones of Time Square etc| but close enough to make walking into the middle of Manhattan pretty easy. I've stayed in the Theatre…,
3,FANSTATIC HOTEL,This hotel is small and luxurious... a wonderful find an a crowded city!  A bit expensive but so worth it!  There is a great breakfast and wine and cheese at night... complimentary!  The staff is super helpful!,
1,My favorite hotel in NYC!!!, It was my fourth stay at the Hotel. The Giraffe! Friendly staff||amazing breakfast complimentary wine in the evening are only some of the things I love about this special hotel !!! Beautiful rooms too !!,
1,It has it all.,Great hotel| great price| great location| great service. All clean and modern. What else do you need? This is the kind of hotel I was looking for in NY.| and the one I will return next time. It is in a busy intersection however they provided a top room that faced 26 street| and it was perfect. The entire staff always very attentive and just waiting to see how they can make your stay more pleasant. Stay here| you will not be disappointed.,
61,Fabulous NYC Stay,"A delightful place to stay.  The service is exceptional.  The staff deserves recognition.  I appreciated all they did to make my stay pleasant.  What I like most about the hotel is everything.  Good size rooms| very clean| and they have an espresso/cappuccino/latte machine available 24/7!  The ""Apres Work"" is great too!  They offer wine at the end of the work day.",
17,Central| quiet| luxurious stay,First impression and last- the level of attention to detail surpassed my expectations| especially with the level of cleanliness in the room. My husband and I were traveling for a week to see my friends and his grandmother and wanted to be in a quiet| but central location. This was certainly it!   From the lovely balcony views to the late night tea/espresso available| we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I also have to say that the doormen| ladies at breakfast service and the attendants behind the counter were incredible. We don't dress up unless we want to and my husband and I are rather young- not once did I feel judged or questioned based on my appearance. I appreciated that and all the suggestions for where to eat dinner and where to buy some better walking shoes.   You all made…,
11,I wouldn't stay anywhere else,From check-in to check-out our stay was fantastic.  All staff were friendly| welcoming and helpful. Happy hour drinks| the restaurant and breakfast were all incredible.  The location is great - bars and restaurants as well as the subway close by. I won't hesitate to stay there again and would highly recommend to anyone.,
7,Great place to stay in NYC.,Beautiful hotel.  We have stayed here a few times and have never been disappointed.  Staff are always so accommodating!  Hotel is convenient to transportation and restaurants.  Valet parking is available.,
3,Wonderful place 💕✨,Had such a lovely stay at this hotel - which made our trip to NY even more enjoyable. The staff is very welcoming and made us feel special| especially Gabriela who is the most considerate host at the complimentary breakfast and wine/cheese reception - she really creates a good atmosphere. The room was like a little oasis with a very comfortable bed. But it is the friendly staff and housekeeping that makes this place really special. We will definetively come back.,
41,Best in New York,Another excellent stay in the hotel. Service was to high standard| as usual. The breakfast and evening cheese and wine are an added bonus to this great located hotel. It's close to subway and an easy 5 mins from Empire state building. Flat iron and Madison park are two mins away. I would not stay anywhere else.,
7,An excellent hotel find in NYC,In a convenient location| this hotel provided excellent service and friendly staff| who went out of their way to assist. The complimentary breakfast was excellent and the happy hour refreshments a bonus. Whilst room was not big| it was fine and comfortable. We will stay again . ,
3,Excellent service but bit noisy,The breakfast and especially the evening cocktail service are nice and attentive.  However| I found the glasses of hotel room not soundproof enough so that there will be noises at night.  It spoiled the overall standard of the hotel| that should have been excellent.,
32,Great place to stay,We stayed at Hotel Giraffe for 5 nights and we will definitely return (or perhaps try another property in the Library collection). Conveniently located in the Flatiron District| a central subway line is two blocks away and great restaurants and shopping is all within walking distance. Our room was spacious for NYC (we had the King with sitting area)| and we loved the complimentary breakfast each morning and the wine and cheese reception each evening. The property and our room was clean and well-maintained| and the staff is friendly.,
2,Awesome Hotel,This is one of the best hotels in NYC.  I have never had a nicer more accommodating staff at any hotel in the City!  The breakfast and wine hours are fabulous.  The rooms are spacious and so comfortable.  ,
9,The Hotel That Makes You Feel At Home,We love Hotel Giraffe and will definitely return.  The staff made us feel at home from the time we arrived to the time we departed. The knowledgeable front desk personnel added true value to our experience of NYC with spot on recommendations.  The morning continental breakfast and afternoon wine and cheese was delightful| having many fresh options and friendly service with servers remembering our preferences and serving it to us without our asking.  The rooms are comfortably large by New York standards with quality finishes| and a comfy bed.  The rooftop garden was a true oasis after a long day on our feet.  The doorman hailed our cab to the airport in mere seconds.  The location is unsurpassed being in the Flatiron neighborhood which is full of amazing restaurants to satisfy…,
7,Helpful staff; excellent stay,Terrific all around.  Super location| convenient to all; helpful friendly staff who looked out for guests; clean| relatively large room; and great amenities (breakfast| happy hour).  Terrific value.  I'd definitely stay again.,
6,A great weekend in NYC,This is the third time we stood at the hotel and it just get better and better. The room the service the people who work there are wonderfull. Everyone how works at the hotel knows how to take care of you| especially Gabriella who takes care of breakfast and the wine and cheese. She remembered us from last year and took very good car of us:,
1,July 2017 weekend stay,My daughter and I had a very nice| 2-night stay at Hotel Giraffe. Very clean and comfortable| and the service at front desk and at breakfast was very good. Dinner our first night was in the restaurant on the first floor| also very good. My only complaint was that our beds were not made/room cleaned during the day after our first night. The maid service arrived as we were getting dressed to go out Saturday night| and was inconvenient. When I asked if she could come back after we were finished dressing| she said no| we were her last stop for the day and she was leaving for the night.,
39,Thoughtful boutique hotel,"The best word I can use to describe this lovely hotel is ""thoughtful"". They really thought of everything-from wine and cheese in the lobby from 5-8| continental breakfast| coffee and tea bar| pastries and fruit all day| Room was tastefully decorated and spotless.",
5,oasis in NYC,We continue to love this hotel.  It is quiet| well appointed| and the lobby is comfortable and inviting... very European in feel| with coffees| teas| wine| and treats available throughout the day.  The staff is professional and accommodating.  This is our go to boutique hotel in the city.,
2,Amazing Boutique Hotel,The Giraffe Hotel exceeded my expectations. The rooms were large and comfortable| the rooftop bar was adorable and had great views of the city| and the wine and cheese reception was perfect. Would definitely recommend this spot ,
1,It's now our new place in NYC!!,We booked 3 nights at the Hotel Giraffe on the excellent recommendation of the TripAdvisor community| and we were not disappointed!  We were a family with 2 school age kids| so we booked a Classic Suite with one King bed and a sofa bed| and it was the perfect size for us.  Very spacious for NYC hotel standards.  It turned out that my kids (age 9 and 11) refused to share a bed| so I requested an extra comforter and blanket so that one could sleep on the floor| which housekeeping brought up very quickly.  What we loved most about this hotel was the level of service they offered.  The check in was friendly| courteous| helpful and professional and the friendliness extended to everybody we were in contact with - the doormen| the front desk every time we passed them| and the breakfast…,
10,Happy Guest,Very glad we chose the Hotel Giraffe based on other guests' reviews. (Thank you previous reviewers.) This hotel is excellent! They have a top notch staff who were very helpful in every way| spacious and comfortable rooms that are well appointed| and a super location for walking to many fun parts of the city. It's a lovely| elegant hotel while also being cozy and personal. I would absolutely stay here again and happily recommend it to others.,
6,#1 choice -- when visiting NYC!,For the 4th year in a row we visit the LIbrary Collection of Hotels. Can't go wrong! Great service| great staff| and LOVE the complimentary wine + cheese each night! Love the morning breakfast as well and in the evenings| the piano bar is always a Rat Pack classic!,
1,Best Hotel in New York,We spent our Anniversary at Hotel Giraffe for two years and totally enjoyed it each time. The hotel is immaculate| the staff was wonderful. We are looking forward to our next trip to New York and wouldn't stay anywhere else.,
6,Excellent place to stay in NY,Very nice ambience.  Great breakfast choices.  Nice wine tasting in the evening.  Clean room and amenities.  Close to metro and various touristy attractions.  If u are lucky| free street parking overnight.  Enjoyed our stay.,
9,Great experienceinn 2nd floor room!,"My elevator adverse theatre kid chose our vacation this year - a week of theatre and geocaching in New York City. We rented a Manhattan apartment through Air BNB| and learned the day before we were leaving that (a) the ""host"" had dramatically misrepresented the apartment| and (b) the apartment was no longer available because the ""host's"" landlord had pulled the plug on her renting through Air BNB.   So| we had one day to find a hotel room in NYC that was accessible without using an elevator. For those who haven't stayed in NYC| hotel entrances are on the ground floor| but hotel lobbies are often many floors above| with rooms beginning on the tenth floor or higher. In most NYC hotels it is exhausting| or impossible| to get to your room without using an elevator.  Hotel Giraffe's…",
2,July 4th Visit,This was our second time to stay at the Hotel Giraffe and this wonderful boutique hotel does not disappoint. From the well designed rooms and amenities| to the helpful & friendly staff| to the daily breakfast & Happy Hour we could not have been more pleased. Perfect location for fun in lower Manhattan. Will absolutely stay here again!,
1,A great stay,This was such a friendly hotel. The additional touches - 24 hour breakfast bar and snacks| 5 o'clock wine and cheese| free wifi etc. - made for a very enjoyable NY stay. I'd definitely come back next time I'm in the Big Apple,
12,always our favorite,we have stayed at giraffe several times| probably five. we feel at home there and treated well. it is quiet| relaxing and lovely; not ostentatious in the least| but tastefully elegant. the same staff people have been there for a long time which says a lot about how they must be treated by owners/ managers.  my only complaint is the difficult to use plastic bottles of shampoo|etc.   these need to be replaced for sure!  ,
10,Fabulous Experience,This was a great location| very clean and stylish room. Love the continental breakfast and evening wine and cheese. Staff were incredibly helpful and their advice was excellent. Close to subway| shops and restaurants. Highly recommend. ,
1,The amazing Giraffe Hotel!!,Working in the travel industry for over 20 years and Hotel Giraffe and their staff have become one of my favorite places to stay! It is a lovely property in every aspect| I will stay with them every time I need a room in Manhattan New York!!  I am a FAN!!,
3,A Gem,We have stayed at Hotel Giraffe whenever we are in New York City and have done so for several years.  It is a small hotel and is therefore pleasantly quiet as well as being very comfortable.  It is more in the style of a small European hotel and there are often foreign travelers staying there.  I highly recommend this hotel whether for business or pleasure.,
2,First class in every way!,"We booked a King suite for 3 of us. Size was more than adequate and the hotel amenities were outstanding. Nice breakfast and the wine and cheese on the evening was an unexpected surprise. Excellent location and close to subway. Will be my ""go to"" NYC hotel. Good value for price.",
1,Excellent Stay,The hotel was very accommodating. The room was very clean. My kids liked the breakfast| and cheese & crackers that was displayed in the late afternoon. We will definitely stay next time we are in town. Thank you,

The breakfast and wine and cheese were the best I've had and I really felt well looked after.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  My room had a small balcony and was delightful.  I would definitely recommend Hotel Giraffe.,
9,Love this hotel,We have stayed in three of the library collection hotels and they are all wonderful. We have stayed at the giraffe several times and the location is fantastic| the staff is amazing| and the roof top garden is delightful. We will be back. ,

4,Wonderful stay at Hotel Giraffe,The staff was excellent! The hotel/room was very clean.  It was wonderful to have a continental breakfast each morning (included) and the wine/cheese at night.  The waitresses were very accommodating.  I would recommend this hotel very highly.  The location is perfect.  I was able to walk to Times Square and Washington Square.,
625,Impeccable! ,Hotel Giraffe at Park Avenue is a lifestyle boutique hotel that caters to those who seek tranquility in the always-busy heart of New York. It's rooftop garden defines this| more than anything.   The staff are fantastic! I now believe that all hotels of the Library Collection have the dream team. I mean seriously| you can never meet a more caring and service-focused staff| than these guys. The service is above and beyond.  I highly recommend. Great value for money| beautiful property| wonderful location. The NoMad neighborhood is everything.   Don't miss out on the cheese and wine afternoons! 5 stars experience| hands down. Certified as one of New York's best kept secrets.  Best| Lucas Raven,
2,Wonderful hotel!,One of the best hotels I have stayed in worldwide. Very clean rooms and great amenities. Very friendly and capable staff with a can-do-attitude. it's a family atmosphere where everyone is constantly smiling. Wonderful location. ,
1,BP,Went to NYC visit and take in a show. The accomodations at the Giraffe were wonderful as we were upgraded to the next level room. The staff was attentive and my wife and I enjoyed our entire expierience.,
2,Great stay in nyc,We loved the hotel. We came in for a girls' weekend -mother daughter and grandmother. From the wine and cheese when we arrived to the cookies when we got back from dinner| all made you feel like an important guest. Waking up and having a fabulous breakfast| even had almond milk for me| just added to the special touches.  Only negative| we had a room with a terrace which seemed like a great idea| but it was very noisy. I heard construction during the night. The others in my party did not hear the noise.,
109,Honeymoon in New York,This was the best hotel I have ever stayed at the wine and cheese reception is what you need after walking miles in the city.  The breakfast and coffee maker helped us save money.  The bed was very comfortable and room is spacious.,
44,Highly recommend ,Could not have had a better stay - lovely staff| excellent location w subway a few minutes away or walk to Washington Square for example| and very nice room w balcony. Good breakfast in pleasant setting and you could get a cup of tea and a biscuit when you returned at night! Lived up to the boutique hotel experience. Would definitely stay there again ,
1,Lovely hotel in NYC,We upgraded to a suite with a balcony which was worth the extra money. The rooms were completely silent when the windows and doors were closed. The bed was extremely comfortable| and the linens were luxurious. The breakfast and 'wine and cheese reception ' were lovely. The staff was warm and welcoming. We will definitely stay here again when we return. ,
76,Dependable superiority,We come here all the time and are terribly spoiled.  The Giraffe is another good reason to come visit New York City.  Service| great space and a good location.  From a nice continental breakfast to a daily happy hour spread| this is the way a top notch boutique hotel should operate.,
3,Great hotel on Park Avenue South,An easy| friendly hotel with spacious rooms.  The guest services staff are very friendly and make it easy to get cabs for anywhere.  Also| the breakfast is fresh and tasty and the evening wine and cheese hours are comfortable and convenient.  Very pleased with the Hotel Giraffe.,
7,Such an amazing hotel…!,Highly recommend Hotel Giraffe – such a wonderful place with great staff. Our King Balcony with Sofa Bed was perfect for our 9 day stay in midtown Manhattan for us and our 2 daughters who shared the sofa bed. Close to the Flatiron Building|  Madison Square Park| Eataly and various subways. Complimentary breakfast was filling with a great array of food from cereal to bagels| toast and fruit and with extraordinary service to go with it. Same for the cheese and wine in the evenings – a must after a long day out walking and sightseeing. Everything about this boutique hotel is 5 star and we wouldn’t stay at any other hotel.,
2,Family tourist trip,Super staff| good location without being in one of the super crowded areas. Clean nice rooms with balconies for some nice outside New York sights and sounds. Complimentary continental breakfast is a plus.,
44,A New Home Away From Home,Ever since Marriott ruined the Algonquin (we knew wnen they put a shock collar on Matilda the lobby cat (who| in her many lives| has lived at the Algonquin since the 1930s) that things were on their way down) we have been searching for a new home away from home - these ex-patriot New Yorkers want to feel like we're really home again when visiting.  The Hotel Giraffe was recommended by a friend - and thank heaven!  We have a beautiful suite with wrap around views - the minor issues in the suite were fixed within an hour (and in the middle of the night| arriving at 10:30 after a late flight into JFK).  And the staff are really terrific and responsive.  The continental breakfast that goes with the room is first rate (nice to have real bagels again!) and comes with it's own staff…,
7,Hotel giraffe is the best,My husband and I stayed at the giraffe for the third time at the end of May for six nights. We had a fabulous time and the staff are all so attentive especially Gabriella who was a perfect host both at breakfast and for cheese and wine in the evenings. The hotel is in a lovely area and close to many lovely restaurants and the subway. I would highly recommend this hotel.,
15,Perfect stay in nyc,Loving our stay at the hotel giraffe!everything is perfect!from the moment you walk through the doors all the staff look after you!nothing ever too much trouble!love the complimentary breakfast and cheese and wine!love our room have to say the most perfect bed we have ever slept in!it's our first visit to nyc and won't be our last!We will return to the hotel giraffe!don't stay anywhere else !Francesca and Brian x,
28,A brilliant comfortable hotel,I loved staying in this hotel. We arrived tired and were immediately offered coffee| prosecco and pastries in the lounge. The room was comfortable with a balcony. Breakfast was really nice with cereals| fresh fruit and all types of bread.  Every evening there was cheese and wine / prosecco served in the lounge with a pianist playing in the background. If I come back to New York for  a fourth time I would stay in this hotel and location again.  I would recommend this hotel and the wonderful friendly staff. We stayed four nights.,
218,LOVE,When I first arrived| I really wasn't sure why the hotel got all the rave reviews it does. The lobby is nice| and the front desk staff were nice. The rooms are nice| but New York sized. The location is nice. After a 6 night stay| I now get it.  All of this niceness somehow coalesces into something fabulous. I loved breakfast--the servers were so welcoming and helpful. Ditto for wine and cheese at night. I think the most accurate thing I can say is that you just feel comfortable and happy here. That's a tough thing to pull off in a NYC hotel| but they've done it. I've already booked my next stay.,
48,Just the best ! ,We have just checked out of this wonderful hotel. I traveled with my Mum who is 80. You are made to feel at home from the moment you arrive. The staff cannot do enough for you and are so friendly. The hotel is in a great area and we walked to most tourist areas . The rooms were great| so comfortable . The breakfasts were excellent and the evening cheese and nibbles a lovely touch . Thanks to all the staff you are amazing and a big hug to Arlety| you are lovely 😃 Can't praise this hotel enough . Thank you !,
2,Best in the city!,Hotel Giraffe is easily my favorite hotel not just in the city| but anywhere!  I've been staying here for a couple of years when I travel for business.  I love it because of the location| cleanliness| friendly and classy staff| and overall accommodations.  The hotel is just plain nice and very classy and reasonably priced.  I highly recommended this hotel for any occasion.,
60,2nd visit,Our second visit in nearly three years.  Just as good as the first |in fact better as we know our way around.  Such a relaxing  atmosphere everywhere in the hotel|  especially the reception area and foray. A great place to unwind after a busy day in the city and even better when Gabby remembers  from nearly three years ago!    Love the wine and cheese in the early evening before going out again.  This time we were lucky with the weather  and used the roof  top bar a couple of times. The little area at the front on this area gives you a great view of the sunsets.   Why stay anywhere else?  ,
10,Love love love this hotel,I've just booked my 3rd visit to The Giraffe Hotel.  I just can't wait. It's such a great hotel with great staff and a great location.  A real gem. I am a picky perfectionist Virgo and even I can't find anything I would say against the place.   It's my go to place when in NYC on vacation.,
2,The ladies trip to the Giraffe !,I have just returned from a wonderful stay at the Giraffe hotel in New York travelling with two long standing friends . I can thoroughly recommend it in every possible way . We shared a suite and the bed settee was put up each evening at a time suitable for us and tidied away each morning . The breakfast and wine and cheese hours are a great way to relax before and after a busy day . The staff are truly delightful with nothing too much trouble from extra towels to transport directions and options . We also really enjoyed taking a cups up to the roof top bar and relaxing there . The hotel was also well positioned for buses and the subway . Thanks to all at the Giraffe for making it a memorable stay ! Marilyn from England,
91,Amazing staff| services and location!,A wonderful stay in the King Suite| which I recommend for families. Stayed there with my parents for 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast| happy hour and overall service and warmth from all of the staff there.,
5,Small boutique hotel,We stayed for 9 days in a corner suite which was ideal as the extra room made our stay really comfortable. The rooms were very clean a little dated but perfect for our needs The staff are very friendly and the free breakfast an extra bonus| at night the drinks and nibbles are a nice touch and Gabriella will look after you morning and night with excellent service and charm| wonderful lady and a joy to meet,
5,Great location,Giraffe Hotel is in a great location and walking distance to many popular locations.  Staff were professional and very well informed.  We loved the breakfast offered and wine/cheese in the evening.  Good sized room.  The only slight problem is the close proximity to the building across the street.  We heard some noise from the street| and we were on the sixth floor on 26th street (not Park Ave).  Overall| a great hotel| and we would not hesitate to stay again.,
1,Perfect NY trip!,Everything about this hotel is so inviting and clean. Beautiful room with very comfortable bed. So nice to go downstairs for breakfast and any type of coffee you like. Took advantage of the wine and cheese each day before our shows. Will definately be back!,
46,Great place to stay☺,Spent 6 nights in the hotel in a queen room with my husband and our 2 21 year old daughters| celebrating their recent birthday's. Room was great| plenty of space for us and lovely bottle of prosecco and card for the girls on our latest arrival following a 5 hour delay in Heathrow.  Staff were very polite and treated us very well. Hotel lobby was a godsend at the end of a busy day.  Only made the cheese and wine 1 night as too much on our agenda| but great to relax for an hour at the end of the day in such a lovely area.  We did have some problems with ants in the room| dealt with when reported| although they kept coming back!  but this wouldn't put us off returning.  A lovely hotel| as a non lift user| the stairs were clean and well lit| although looked more for staff use| but…,
1,EUROPE IN NYC,This hotel is warm and inviting. The staff is friendly and helpful. The lobby area offers morning breakfast| all day snacks and coffee| and evening wine and cheese. Felt like I was in Europe. Rooms are beautifully done and are neat and clean with the cutest balconies. Turn down service always a plus.  Overall great experience!!,
1,Consistently first class in every way.,This was our third stay here over the last four years.  Nothing has changed and that is a very good thing.  This place remains a gem.  The location| staff| comfort| condition and cleanliness of the rooms| all are top notch.  But the genius of the place is the lobby.  A casual spot to rest| converse| enjoy breakfast| a rotating selection of snacks| and at all hours get one of the best cups of coffee in New York City.  In the evening after a busy day in the City it's a welcome comfort to sit back and sip on a glass of Proseco or a selection of wines.  And the women who service this oasis| they are perfect!  They are friendly| efficient and when appropriate non-intrusive.  I hate to share this secret| but the management and staff of this hotel have earned their right for me to…,
4,This hotel is a gem,We've stayed at this hotel three times in the past years.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and the same staff has been there each time we've stayed.  Great location.  Near subways and Madison Square Park.  This is a must stay hotel.,
1,Best kept secret,This was a fantastic find. Fabulous room and doesn't break the bank.  The team was so friendly and really went out of their way to be helpful and accommodating.  Location is superb| Close to subway and the Path. Easy in and out for Uber. I travel 50% of any given year and I am putting this hotel on the top of my list for NYC choices.,
9,Best amenities!,The giraffe is my favorite hotel in the city. Amazing breakfast| great wine and cheese hours| use of the rooftop deck| complimentary water bottles. Location is quiet and a nice reprieve from the rest of the city,
2,Lovely,We thorough enjoyed our stay at Hotel Giraffe. My daughter mentioned that she felt like everyone there was sincerely committed to making sure we had a pleasant experience. I think we got all of our money's worth and more. ,
216,Second time staying here and won't be the last,Perfect size hotel| lovely staff| great breakfast and wine in the evening.  Wonderful location| easy access to the subway; can walk to many attractions midtown.  Rooms are large and comfortable. Book a room with a balcony. ,
89,Great Hotel,Stayed here for 3 night to celebrate my birthday. Our room was on the top floor where there is an outside deck. Weather was bad so we did not utilize the area. We Saw some ash trays up there which we assumed meant that they allow smoking which was a bit of a disappointment to us. Our room had a King bed with a small balcony which looked into office space across the street a a slight view of Madison Square Park. However opening the door for air made for too much noise from the street but It it was a nice option. The room also had black out  curtains which we appreciated  The room was clean with the exception of some carpet staining and the Bed was comfortable and had nice linens and a mattress cover. However| we where disappointed that the mattress and box spring where not…,
3,An oasis in the middle of the busy.,We had never stayed at Hotel Giraffe before| but were intrigued by the name. It was as peaceful as the animal it is named after. From the staff in advance of our arrival to the warmth of the room decor it was a true pleasure to visit this hotel. My husband especially loved the books in the room and read up on giraffes throughout our stay. Thank you for a wonderful experience and the location was also better than we could have hoped for.,
11,Wonderful stay,highly recommended. convenient location.   They have a very well trained staff who were eager to help.  continental breakfast and wine and cheese receptions were a nice touch.  lots of good restaurants in the area.,
16,Great Hotel!,Great hotel. Clean room| Super friendly and helpful staff. Nice continental breakfasts and wine and cheese in the evening. Good Location. Would definitely stay here again and room was much better than NYC Waldorf.,
8,Warm Service,The hotel vibe is nice and the downstairs lobby is quite pleasant. The room we had was large by New York standards| though nothing lavish. It suited our purpose| in short.   The service was better than almost all hotels I have ever visited| and I have been to a lot of places.. Nobody ever let us walk in or out of the front door without opening the door courteously for us. The happy hour staff was most pleasant and seemed to really enjoy the guests. The housekeeping staff (we had the same maid all 4 days) seemed to truly care about details in a way that a friend would. For example| she held the elevator for me| cleaned our room in the early evening| and honored all requests with ease.   There was honestly nothing better the staff could have done to make our stay more pleasant or…,
1,Beautiful,We stayed for 3 nights at Hotel Giraffe for our mini-Honeymoon from June 5-June 8. The service was excellent! Everyone in the front desk was beyond friendly and ready to answer any questions guests might have. The free continental breakfast and wine and cheese in the afternoons were perks as well. The room was so clean| comfortable and quiet it was easy to forget we were staying in downtown Manhattan. Also| the location was really convenient| since it was fairly easy to walk to SoHo| Chinatown| and even Battery Park from the hotel. This experience surpassed our great expectations. We definitely will be staying at this hotel the next time we are planning a trip to the city.,
46,A Gem of a Hotel!,We enjoyed this hotel in so many ways! The staff are welcoming| gracious and eager to help. Every space is attractive and immaculate. There is a complimentary continental breakfast with staff who prepare your coffee| bagels| etc.| and| wine and cheese in the evening| both served in the comfortable lobby. With only 72 rooms| the hotel feels very intimate. They have paid attention to little things which make it memorable: a potted geranium on the room's balcony| a foliage plant in the room| a ceiling-to-floor shade over the generous windows| large bathroom| plenty of drawers and a big closet| great work space| comfortable chairs| and evening turn-down service. There was a nice mix of guests - business people and families. If the location works for you| don't hesitate to book here!,
2,The nicest people ever work at this hotel!,I stayed with my husband for more than a week. It's a wonderful hotel| excellent area to stay. Just one block from union square and lots of nice restaurants around. I will certainly recommend hotel Giraffe.,
147,Fantastic Place,Very nice accommodation!  The room was clean and had enough space for us to be very comfortable. Our son| who lives in SOHO| said it's got the largest hotel bathroom in Manhattan; seems doubtful to me| but it was nice.  The very helpful and friendly staff add to the pleasant atmosphere.  Don't forget to have a drink at the rooftop bar if you have a chance.  There's a nice free light appetizer happy hour in the lobby with cheeses that were surprisingly good.  I'll stay here again when I come back to this part of Manhattan. ,
1,Great time!,Had a great stay at Hotel Giraffe! The rooms were spacious| modern and cozy! The staff went above and beyond and love the complimentary breakfast! The location was perfectly central to wherever you need to go in the city| defiantly will be back!,
22,Wow! Wow! Wow!,"I have to travel to NYC fairly regularly for business| and on our last trip (6 days long) we chose to stay at Hotel Giraffe because of its convenient location and positive reviews... but WOW! The reviews do not do the hotel justice| and if I could rate my experience 6-stars| I would! The hotel is clean and beautiful. Everything works| and all is as you would expect in a high quality lodging. However| the amenities are over the top (complimentary continental breakfast; wine| prosecco| cheese| & veggies daily| and all sorts of in-room offerings for additional comfort - we added a mattress pad to our sleep sofa and took advantage of satin sleep masks)| and the service is so friendly and so amazing that this hotel should outrank them all. I have stayed in ""4-star hotels"" in NY that…",
11,Fantastic!,We stayed here 5 nights and had a Great experience. Nice continental breakfast is included. Also the included wine and cheese| we liked a lot. The staff were friendly| especially gabriella who is really Fantastic.  Also a Nice atmosphere in the lobby. The rooms are not big| but Nice and clean.  We Will surely come back here.,
4,Great stay,We stayed here for 5 nights to visit a friend who lives in NY. I came with my three daughters ages 12| 12 and 9| their first time in NYC. The hotel was perfect for us| its in a great location| near to some parks| not far from the Empire State Building| Grand Central Station| some lovely shops on 5th Avenue. We had 2 double beds which were really comfy and adequate for sharing with my girls. The staff in the hotel were so helpful and friendly. Would definitely return there again,
168,Another great stay at Hotel Giraffe,"This was our fifth time staying at Hotel Giraffe. The staff is very welcoming. On our first day| as we were walking up to the hotel| the bellman said ""Welcome back!""  All of the staff is very welcoming and accommodating. The rooms are very clean and the housekeeping staff is spot on. The morning breakfast is excellent.  Stay here. You'll be glad you did. ",
1,Amazing Hotel,Undoubtedly one of the best hotels in NYC. Great location| friendly staff| respectful and very qualified. We loved the beauty of the facilities| our room had a balcony and a wonderful view that allowed us to enjoy an active and lively city. Breakfast a total delight| plus the fruit and snack service at any hour of the day was one of the things we liked the most. A wine and cheese happy hour and a terrace with wonderful views. Without a doubt did we not only loved the hotel| but we want to return. ,
1,Extras are great| rooms are average.,The evening cocktails and breakfast coffee are fabulous.  Waiters and helpers work hard to make those experiences great.  This is the reason to chose this hotel. Newspapers available but not enough for everyone so fellow guests asking to snag yours if you put it down.,
10,Nice inexpensive suites,"The staff is universally friendly and this is a ""no-extras"" hotel. A nice breakfast is included in the lobby| and generous wine| chees and crackers including bubbly every afternoon.  Room service includes turndown. Location at 26th and Park is pretty central and an Uber of $10-12 will take you anywhere in Manhattan.  The negatives are minor--the refrigerator is cold|but empty (but free bottled water is supplied)| and there is some street noise (but not bad) at night.  The reqular rooms are small| but the suites are a bargain at less than most regular rooms in the area.",
1,Great place to spend Memorial Day Weekend,Stayed here with my partner for Memorial Day weekend. We had a 3rd floor suite -- lots of space to spread out| which was a first for us during an NYC visit. For the space| this felt like a steal. Maids were awesome and did complementary turn down service without us even asking for it! The complementary breakfast in the AM and wine/cheese in the evening was awesome as well.,
12,Excellent customer service,We had booked to stay at the Hotel Giraffe for June half term. We were caught up in the chaos of the BA flight disruption due to the mass computer failure and closure of Heathrow Terminal 5 on the day we were due to travel.  Unfortunately we didn't make it to New York due to this.   The hotel staff (Gaby)  responded quickly to our emails and| when we initially thought we might make our trip the next day| they reassured us that our first night accommodation charge would be waived. Our rebooked flight the following day was also cancelled and we emailed the hotel to let them know that we were having to cancel our holiday. They responded quickly and told us that they would not charge us for our stay.   The hotel could have charged us for our entire stay based on the rate that we…,
27,Top-notch habitation,"The accommodations and staff of the hotel are absolutely first rate. The location is perfect for getting north to the theater district or south to Greenwich Village and its environs| and the availability of both breakfast and a late-afternoon ""wine down"" is an added plus for us!",
280,Terrific facility and Outstanding staff,Just returned from a 14 day stay at this hotel. The staff made us feel as if we were at home. Our room had all the amenities that we needed and then some. The breakfast provided daily kept us going well into lunch time. The evening snacks were just right and the pianist was a pleasant nightly (M-F) nightly entertainment. This was our first trip to NYC and the hotel staff made more than an effort to keep us happy. If you are looking for a location out of the center of busy Manhattan this is the place! Plenty of great restaurants within easy walking distance. Thumbs Up and special high fives to employee J.R.,
24,Location| Hospitality| Perks...NYC at Christmas!,"This past Christmas my sister and I took my 10 year old son and a close family friend| (14 year old girl) to NYC.  Traveling during the Christmas week was a little bit crazy| but it is a ""Holiday Spirit"" guarentee.  Highlights of the trip: 1. Hotel Giraffe....great location...On Park Ave South...Near Grand Central Station and just a few blocks down 5th Avenue from the shopping...great starting point| as we were far enough away from the holiday traffic| that we were able to get just about anywhere in 15 minutes....we booked early enough to get an amazing deal (less than $400/night) on a two-room suite| which included a pullout sofa and a little more room than the ""normal"" NYC hotel.  The staff were incredibly attentive....My sister and I loved the Expresso/Lattes in the AM and…",
46,Nice| comfortable| quiet hotel in nice| comfortable| quiet area.,I should have written this right after I visited| but I forgot. I would stay here again| I really like the location and it's not a massive hotel. Going between your room and the street doesn't take a lot of time. The simple breakfast foods are a nice touch. I didn't have to interact with the staff other than to check in/out| so while I can't comment on them| it's good that it wasn't necessary.,
30,Incredible Stay!,The rooms are delightful| great location but the thing that makes this hotel so special is the staff.  The Reception staff are so so friendly| incredibly helpful and a really credit to the hotel. The lady from the Czech Republic was amazing - she served breakfast with a big smile and so engaging without being over the top| she was exactly the same when we came back from a long day walking| except this time with a lovely cold glass of prosecco and cheese!  This is such a welcome gesture every evening between 5 - 8 being able to enjoy complimentary wine and nibbles!  Loved it here and would thoroughly recommend.,
27,Beautiful Hotel,Hotel Giraffe is brilliant a little oasis of calm in the madness of Manhattan. We stayed at this hotel for a week and I don't have anything bad to say about it. The breakfast was more than adequate| the tea| coffee and cakes were a nice touch through the day and the cheese and wine reception at night was lovely. All the staff at this hotel are excellent from the front desk to the cleaners| everyone is really nice and very helpful. We had a balcony room which was nice to stand and look onto Park Avenue and watch the world rush by. It was well within walking distance of the subways| we found it no problem to get around from the hotel.,
17,Quick trip to NYC,Fab hotel could not fault -personally not as grand as the sister Elysee hotel| but service and rooms were great would definitely go back and request same room suite on 8th. Lovely quiet small hotel in middle of the bustle.,
1,Our Go To Spot,Comfortable| clean| excellent service| terrific breakfast with all day coffee| etc. a real plus.  Staff was very courteous and helpful.  While not inexpensive| it was worth the price; valet service was very convenient and reasonable compared to NYC parking garages.  Will make it our go to hotel when we stay in Manhattan,
532,Perfect in every way,We stayed in a suite - sitting area and bedroom divided by bathroom - privacy for each of us.  You are not disturbed by routine maid serice - just put the card on the door handle| and it will be taken care of almost immediately.  If you need extra towels| etc.| just call down to the desk.  There is an open deck on the 12th floor| where you can bring a drink or eat breakfast.  There is a restaurant attached to the hotel (Bread & Tulips).  We did not eat there| but popped in for a couple of drinks while our room was being readied.  Staff was extremely friendly| and we really enjoyed the lovely sitting area where we had our drinks.  There is a more than adequate free breakfast every morning - the best part is they will prepare your coffee just the way you like it.  There is wine…,
63,Excellent Guest Service and Beautiful Rooms,We came a bit early and couldn't check into our room. They gave us a 20% discount card to eat at Bread and Tulips while we waited and they offered to hold our bags for us. When we returned our room was ready and they helped bring our bags up to our room. The bed was a bit hard for my liking| but still pretty comfortable. The pillows were great! We did end up having a toilet issue| but they resolved it for us promptly. Every staff member that brought us breakfast or helped us find our way around were all very friendly and kind. I greatly enjoyed my stay here| but next time I will ask for a room on a higher floor. We were on floor two and the traffic noise was excessive for us as we aren't accustomed to it. Overall this was an amazing hotel and I'd recommend staying here.,
1,Excellent Customer service,We were greeted by wonderful staff upon arrival.  Our room was great.  We came to NYC for a girls weekend of Broadway shows and fun.  The food and wine at cocktail hour was wonderful.  We went up to the rooftop which was fabulous.  Breakfast in the morning was not fancy but Gabriela made it personal and perfect.  Loved the location.  One of my favorite buildings is the Flatiron.,
54,A lovely oasis in the Big Apple,A lovely hotel with very friendly staff - we will be returning soon.  The rooms are plenty big enough| the breakfast great| and the evening reception a great way to unwind after a day exploring the City.  If the weather is good - go up to the 12th floor and relax on the roof terrace ... a hidden gem.,
55,Comfortable and Convenient,At every turn| Hotel Giraffe delivered a little more than we expected. The continental breakfast included espresso drinks| fresh fruit| yogurt| hard-boiled eggs -- lots of good choices. The amenities included slippers| robes| umbrellas -- nothing was overlooked. The room had live plants artfully arranged. The housekeeping staff did a great job| too. We could not have been more pleased.,
14,visiting family,I absolutely love staying at Hotel Giraffe when I plan a trip to NYC......amid the hustle of the city| it is a quiet relaxing oasis.....The staff is excellent and actually remember guests from previous stays.  ,
6,Wonderful return to the Hotel Giraffe,We have stayed at the Hotel Giraffe multiple times and| each time we are there| we are totally pleased. The service is great. The staff go out of their way to be helpful| including having our car parked and ready hours before we needed it. We enjoy the breakfast and wine/cheese reception each day in the lovely lobby. The room is a very comfortable size and nicely decorated. The hotel is centrally located and perfect for doing our favorite things in NY. This is our favorite hotel in NYC and we plan on returning again!,
1,Gabriela is the best!!!,I travelled for work| because of the relationship with RRU Research and I definitely would come back/ recommend it to others. My favorite memory is the lovely Gabriela at breakfast and cocktail hour. After spending long days in an office| it was so refreshing to have such a smart| kind person to talk with. It was only a few minutes at a time| but it really made me enjoy the hotel! Give her a raise!! :),
2,NY in May,Favorite hotel in NYC. Great staff| comfortable rooms| wonderful lobby. Breakfast and wine in the afternoon are great. Location is unbeatable. And they even play good music in the lobby. If you want a boutique this is a good one. Sister Hotel Elysee also terrific. ,
1,Great place to stay!,Rooms were beautiful; lobby is comfortable and pretty. Breakfast and wine/cheese reception is generous and delicious.  I highly recommend this hotel. Location was good for meetings in mid-town and east village.,
1,Haven in Manhattan,Incredible service from a young staff team. Gabriella continues to be an asset to the hotel making wine time a very pleasant end to what can be an exhausting day of sightseeing. Together with the breakfast| tea and coffee service| plus very comfortable rooms we found the Hotel Giraffe a haven in what is a very busy city.,
204,Well located| modern with all the amenities.,My wife and I have travelled the world and stayed in a lot of hotels.  Sometimes you stay in beautiful properties but the attitude of the staff leaves a bad impression| not so with Hotel Giraffe.  The property is well presented and the staff really do enhance the experience.  Located in mid-town New York the property provides access to all major attractions.  Without repeating everything listed on the hotel's website the amenities are first class.    We had an incident with a missing piece of luggage and the staff were extremely helpful in ensuring the item was reunited with us| keeping us informed by email and storing the item until our return to the city.  This property is rated highly by trip advisor and having now stayed here I can see why.  Great property| fantastic staff…,
1,Amazing hotel and staff,Great hotel| amazing service| lobby breakfast and evening wine and cheese were quite nice| and beautifully served| suite was nicely appointed| comfortable and quiet and all in a convenient location.  Have already recommended to friends.,
13,It's all about the staff!,This was our first trip to NY and found this hotel through TripAdvisor| the hotel and location you cannot fault| what we expected really| but it is the staff that made this experience so memorable for us. The very first night| 2 weary travellers arrived late in the evening to a very warm welcome and a cold bottle of complementary Prosecco thanks to JR on the desk. All the staff were friendly and hospitable but a special mention goes to Gabriela| a more attentive and friendlier staff member you could not meet. (with an infectious laugh) She quickly picks up what your wishes are and after a couple of nights| had our choice of wine poured for us before we even asked. (all compliments of the hotel I might add| every night between 5 and 8 with accompanying cheeses| biscuits etc and…,
2,Excellent,"Room #603.  Staff were friendly| knowledgeable and polite.  Serving a continental breakfast each morning and hors d'oeuvres each evening  was superb.  I especially liked the friendly atmosphere it encouraged amid the sharing of ideas.  JR particularly helpful.  Left my house keys somewhere ""safe"" in room #603.  Please notify me when they are found.  I will definitely recommend The Giraffe to others and return myself",
3,Always the greatest  people,perfect location as it is close to everything. the rooms are clean and modern. the best part of the hotel is the staff.  i had not been there for 9 months.  When i checked in| everyone| including the barrista| said welcome back.,
1,Excellent staff| wonderful room,Great breakfast and happy hour.  Amazing hotel.  The staff is outstanding| professional and so helpful.  From my first interaction on the phone to the last the customer service was impeccable.  I hope to visit again soon.,
27,Great in every way!,We could not be more happy with our recent stay in Hotel Giraffe.  Location is very good (close to all highlights| on the corner of Madison Square Park| 3 subway stations within 2 minutes walk)| and which we loved| in a calm area so no Times Square madness here.  We only met friendly and helpfull employees. Especially Gabriella is a gem| who takes great care of all her customers during breakfast and the daily wine & cheese happy hour. We loved having a calm breakfast in the hotel before we got on our feet to explore NY. And then| at the end of a busy day returning in the hotel and before going out again to dinner| Gabriella was waiting with a nice glass of wine or prosecco. While we were enjoying this| our son loved some time-alone in the room with the wifi. With kids| a suite…,
215,Perfect (again)!,Our first visit to this fine hotel was in 2014. We returned again to find the same well-managed property| a lovely staff| a comfortable room and fine amenities. First--location. The Giraffe  is about a mile from Grand Central Station| near subway stops| and an easy walk to restaurants| etc. in the Flatiron area. While this is not a budget venue| a very good breakfast and a 3 hour wine and cheese event in the evening are part of your room rate. You will not find a nicer group of staff| from the door to the desk to the lobby lounge to the room maid. Wi-fi is fast| all spaces are impeccable| and up to date. We love this property!,
10,Lovely place in a good location ,We stayed for five nights in May.   We found the hotel to be nicely appointed. The room was generously sized for NY and had more than enough for our needs.  The staff were all excellent. The wine and cheese reception was an unusual offering but great! There was someone playing piano during the reception each day| which was a lovely addition.   The breakfast was a basic offering (compared to Europe) but more than adequate.   Highly recommended. ,
4,This hotel was a highlight of our trip!,We loved this hotel!  I was in NYC with my Mum and Sister in Law for a weekend and we booked a suite in this hotel for the three of us| purely based on how good the reviews were - and we were not disappointed.  It is| perhaps| a bit underwhelming when you first arrive - no glitzy lobby etc.  But the service and what is provided is phenomenal.  All of the staff are so friendly.  The breakfast is delicious - big bowls of fresh fruit| croissants| bagels| nice coffee etc.  There is tea and coffee available all day and you are welcome to take it up to your room.  And the wine/cheese (5-8pm) is fab!  Nice prosecco| served by the nicest woman ever and as many glasses as you like.  We felt properly spoilt by the whole experience.  Definitely a fantastic place to stay in NYC...,
13,726,Quality and comfortable,Very welcoming| excellent decor and design| comfortable rooms| had a suite which is not a lot more than a normal room; a big plus is the free breakfast in the morning and wine and canapes at 5pm - akin to an executive lounge and very popular. Only negative for me was the specific location| just a few blocks away from some of my favourite places like Union Square and Gramercy. Like to wake up and walk through the parks etc. and the neighbouring blocks had little appeal.
1,Gem,We have stayed at the Giraffe many times over the past several years and have always had a great experience. From the bell staff and front desk management (wish I had the names)  to the service in the lobby(Gabriela and more...) there is an unusual effort to accommodate all guests. A wonderful place to start or finish your day in a bustling city!,
10,A haven in NYC!,Conveniently located| urban decor and welcoming | attentive staff. The extras are what make it ...complimentary cocktail hour bevies and snacks and continental breakfast too! After a day in a vibrant but frenzied city| the hotel's a perfect haven.,
7,Fantastic stay at Hotel Giraffe,"This Hotel offers a very warm welcome.  The staff were efficient |polite| informative and personable. The ""happy two hours"" the Hotel offers all its guests with complimentary Wine and cheeses nightly enabled the guests to chat and unwind.  The Hotel is in a great position and close to the metro.  I look forward to returning to this Hotel.",
32,A good stay,Nice hotel - great front desk staff.  The afternoon wine and cheese and morning light breakfast are AWESOME.  Rooms are a bit dim| can use some sprucing up but overall a very good value for NYC. Would def recommend.,
6,Wonderful getaway weekend!,This is our second time at a LIbrary hotel and we loved it! Once agan the staff was just wonderful| our hotel room spotless| the little balcony a fun indulgence and the glass of wine at 5pm a sweet spot at the end of a busy day. Hotel Giraffe is the icing on the cake of a getaway trip to NYC! If you are searching Tripadvisor trying to find just the right spot - a hotel that's not a megatower yet in a perfect spot to see the sights of NYC - STOP - you have just found it - book now! Pricey? - a bit| but worth every single penny.,
5,A timely gem in NYC,What a wonderful property to begin our first trip to New York in! Hotel Giraffe has a lot of old school charm encapsulated in a modern setting with service that could only be beffitting to this lovely property. The rooms and hotel facilities were well appointed| staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and the added bonus of a continental breakfast as well as a wine service in the evenings made coming back to Giraffe after a long day out feel like we were coming home. Gabriella was particulary charming (and it was great testing my rusty old hungarian with her!) and made us feel even more welcome. I can honestly say Giraffe ticks all the boxes when considering a Hotel that emulates the granduer of such an incredible city. We cant wait to come back.,
1,Terrific Experience,Beautiful clean rooms with comfortable beds.  Very courteous and helpful staff.  24 hr coffee bar was great amenity.  Breakfast had nice variety.  Close to our activities. Would definitely recommend this hotel!,
30,Would not recommend,My sister and I stayed Home Giraffe for five nights in February. Overall| it was a disappointing experience.   We arrived in the middle of the night - I'd rung the hotel in advance to say our flight had been delayed and we would be arriving late. Check in took a very long time and the front desk staff were less than friendly| which was a shame. When we got to our room| we found the walls to be EXTREMELY thin and we could hear everything happening in the room next door. Needless to say we returned downstairs (it was well past midnight by now) to request a different room. We were given another key and told to go and see if we liked that room better. The key didn't work| so it was back down to reception to ask them to fix it. All the while the man behind the desk could not have…,
119,Fantastic hotel with fabulous service!,This boutique hotel is in a great location| our room was lovely and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  Their 3 hour free breakfasts and happy hours were the icing on the cake.  We'll be staying here on all future visits to the city!,
1,my favorite nyc hotel,Everything looks clean| both the rooms and the public spaces.  I love having the refrigerator in the room. The staff is helpful and friendly| never too busy for the guests.  Excellent complementary breakfast. Hot tea| water| coffee available to guests all day. The location works well| close to subways| Union Square| diverse restaurants within walking distance.  Nearby markets| grocery stores and drug  stores for whatever you might need.  I look forward to my next visit.,
5,Just awesome,This place is just fantastic and I will be staying here on my next NY trip!  All of the staff were really friendly| approachable and helpful with local information. Additionally| the hotel provided complimentary cheese and drinks which made the stay so comfortable and chilled. ,
20,Love Giraffe,This is my now favorite NYC hotel.  Perfect location and staff is terrific.  Rooms were great.  Loved breakfast.  Can't wait to return to this hotel for our next NYC visit.  Didn't get to see the roof top area due to rain but hopefully next time. ,
1,My favorite hotel,Hotel giraffe is top of the list for me when I'm in New York.  A home away from home. Always enjoyable to see family. I love the chocolates and hospitality at anytime. Gabriella remembers all names. Thank you for being kind and thoughtful. I will return. ,
443,Classic,The room was very spacious. Continental breakfast and evening wine and cheese were great| especially when it was raining and you don't wanna venture out. The waitress| Gabriella was such a delight! Warm service and smiles from her all the time.  Wifi through out the hotel was great. Able to get my work done.  Will stay again although the furniture is quite old. ,
143,Hotel Giraffe - A Real Find!!,I almost didn't want to write this review as I wanted to keep the gem to myself - but that wouldn't be fair on Hotel Giraffe!  An excellent boutique style hotel that makes you feel welcome as soon as you arrive.  Lovely rooms| relaxed atmosphere and great staff too. Also happened to meet Ray| the general manager| who was great too.  A simple continental breakfast is included as is cheese & wine in the evening.  We will definitely stay at Hotel Giraffe next time we are in NYC,
61,A real gem!,Our stay was perfect! From check-in to check-out| everything was more than fine. Nice| clean and spacious room for NYC| nice amenities and great service. Breakfast more than fine and afternoon wines didn't hurt either. The hotel will be my base in the city from now on. Definitely!,
11,Great place to stay in NYC!,Everything about this hotel is fabulous.  From the cappuccino/espresso machine and snacks in the lobby to the spacious| clean| and comfortable room - complete with slippers and robe.  The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful.   Location was also central to all my needs.  Best of all| it is affordable when you compare it to other hotels.  This is where I plan to stay the next time I am in NYC!  Thank you Hotel Giraffe.,
19,Our new favorite NYU hotel,"Found this little gem near Union Square while looking for a room for 3 while visiting our freshman daughter. Corner suite was double the size of the typical Manhattan room with King bed and separate living room with comfortable pull out sofa for our teen. Spacious compared to other places we have stayed. Nice breakfast and happy hour in lobby can save you lots money. No gym in the hotel but complimentary pass to NYSC a couple of blocks away was great and exceeded the typical hotel exercise room...did not mind the short walk at all. Union square was a short walk. 23rd street subway station even closer. Staff was ""over the top"" friendly. I was reluctant to share our experience on Trip Advisor because I wanted to keep this place a secret... graduation is still 3 years away!",
37,No Longer NYC's Best Kept Secret,When I first began staying at the Hotel Giraffe several years ago| few travelers seemed to know about it.  Perhaps my reviews have been too glowing| but now it seems to be one of the most popular hotels in the city.  Deservedly so.  The location is perfect - close to all subway lines and a wide array of restaurants (including Shake Shack)| shopping| and tourist attractions.  It's an easy walk to Union Square.  The rooms are clean| comfortable| and spacious by NYC standards.  The staff is courteous and helpful.  The hotel offers a complimentary breakfast and a lovely wine & cheese hour each evening.  (Gabriela| the hostess| is one of the most important reasons I keep returning.)  The Hotel Giraffe may no longer be a secret| but it's probably one of the best values in Manhattan.,
3,Weekend in NYC,A birthday girl and bride weekend celebration. Great location| nice breakfast| great on site restaurant. Centrally located to go up or down town. Subway two blocks away. Hotel staff very accommodating. ,
38,Favorite Hotel in NYC!,I have stayed many times and I am satisfied always! Staff is great! Location I love and the morning breakfast and afternoon snacks are a welcome. Would be my choice of hotel to stay any time of year. Thanks again staff at the Giraffe Hotel for a comfortable 2 night stay.,
29,Perfect in all respects,I won't go into too many details about the Giraffe as many other reviewers have covered this.  The Giraffe is a small hotel by NYC standards.  It lacks the facilities provided by the larger hotels but this is where its charm lies.  We booked a family room with two queen beds for my wife| myself| and two teens.  We stayed for a week and throughout everyone was happy with the room.  The complimentary breakfast and evening cheese and wine buffet were a real bonus.  The location of the hotel and the fact that the nearest subway station is two blocks away made it so easy for us to go down or uptown fairly quickly.  Finally| what really gains the Giraffe its five-star ratings are the members of staff.  They are really friendly| always helpful| and very professional.  Being a small…,
6,nicest people ever!!!,Unfortunately I had to cancel reservation one day after stated deadline (6 days prior to arrival)  - no questions asked| really ice people. No doubt will stay here to check the hotel next time I fly to NY!!!,
20,Very Nice Boutique Hotel,We just returned from NYC and The Giraffe did not disappoint.  I travelled with my family of four and we stayed in the King Suite. I was worried that it would be too tight for the four of us and almost booked another room; however| I'm happy I didn't because this room was perfect. The pullout bed was enough room for two teens to sleep.  We asked for a foam on top to make it more comfortable. The king size bed was super comfortable with very nice linens.  The suite had a nice layout with lots of closet space and although the bathroom wasn't huge| it had a lot of counter and shelf space as well.  We were provided with lots of thick towels and soaps & lotions.  My only negative about the room itself was the glass window in the bathroom door.  I would recommend the hotel black it…,
32,Excellent hotel,Spacious| comfortable room.  Nice breakfast and wines in the afternoon.  Service always friendly.  Pleasant terrace where you can bring your wine.  Free WiFi.  Great location| just one block from Madison Square Park| 4 minutes to the subway and 10 minutes to Union Square,
17,Can I go back??? :),If there would be an opportunity to give 10 stars| I would do it! Amazing place to stay. Loved exploring the area| there's a lot to see around! Thank you for everything| the view from my room was stunning!,
32,Very nice hotel in a perfect position to visit nyc,The hotel is very clean| with excellent and friendly staff. Located in perfect position to visit the city| between to subway stops that cover all destinations. Very nice either cheap or nit restaurants at walking distance. Perfect!,
9,Love The Giraffe,A stay at The Giraffe is like staying at a friends home ( a good friend!)- the staff is so welcoming and sincere| always helpful with any questions. The rooms are very large by NYC standards and the small balconies are a real bonus. The location is perfect for heading up| down or across town. Always easy to get a cab and Madison Square Park is a lovely place to sit and people watch. Gabby in the lobby is such a joy and makes breakfast and happy hour a serene time to relax. Highest recommendation!,
8,Hotel Giraffe Best Boutique Hotel in NYC,This was my 8th time to Hotel Giraffe in the last 7 years. I love this place from its location| the rooms | the amenities and services| and most of all the staff. Special thanks to Gabriella who always makes sure my glass of prosecco is topped up.,
131,Best hotel in Manhattan,I stayed here for 3 nights with my sister and we both loved it.  The staff are fantastic - especially Gabriella - who made our stay so special.  The breakfast| which I would normally not have in the hotel | is super and the wine  & cheese is a lovely way to chill after shopping all day.  I love the Flatiron area and would definitely stay in the Hotel Giraffe again.,
5,Giraffe sticks its neck out for guests,Good size rooms| excellent continental breakfast and wine happy hour both included. Also attentive staff and free wifi. This was my 20th visit to this property. Good location two. Locks from east side subway and three blocks from west side subway.,
1,Flawless,I have stayed in 5 star hotels all over the world but I must say my short 2 night stay at the Giraffe was impeccable and flawless. Check-in was fast and easy| the room was perfect| even my morning room service arrived right on time and hot. The evening wine and cheese in the lobby was an added plus. And the motorized blackout window shade was an unexpected luxury. My pet peeve with hotels is usually the A/C with the room either too hot| too cold| too drafty or too noisy - but I never had to give it a thought at the Giraffe. I was even able to figure out the TV without the usual frustration or call to the front desk. The Giraffe will be my new home-away-from-home in NYC and I can't wait to return.,
2,Incredible hotel with outstanding service,When I visit NYC this will be the ONLY place I stay. The complimentary breakfast was excellent.  I loved the nightly wine and cheese with piano music and our room was lovely (the bed was very comfortable!) It is close to several restaurants and a short cab ride to anything else. This hotel provided the perfect backdrop to the perfect weekend!,
4,Short stay in New York,I was a bit disappointed in the hotel as it was rated so high on tripadvisor.  The intial welcome by the hotel staff was wooden...it was like she was reading a text. The walls are paper thin...I could hear someone taking a shower in the room above.  You can hear the garbage collection early in the morning (outside on the street)...so very noisy.  The happy hour was nice and the staff so nice and accommodating.  Hard to get a seat at breakfast as the hotel was very busy,
1,Hotel Giraffe is wonderful,We loved the Hotel Giraffe! Staying in the family suite was perfect for our family of five. We loved the daily wine and cheese as well as how helpful and accommodating the staff was. We will definitely return for another stay! ,
12,Everything and more!,We booked here for my 30th celebration trip to New York. My parents had visited NYC before but still weren't sure where the best location would be to base ourselves. I'm forever grateful that we stumbled upon the Hotel Giraffe on our search. The location is perfect for walking north or south| within 2 blocks of the subway stop that accesses convenient lines up or down the city and is just outside of the uber-busy city nightlife. Don't get me wrong| there's still the quintessential New York noise that seeps through the window| but the rooms were beautifully made up for us each night| elegant bathroom fixtures and fittings| and wonderful service from the staff throughout.   I almost want to keep this place a beloved secret of my own| but wouldn't deny anyone the simple pleasure of…,
1,Great experience,Stayed with my daughter for one night| we could not have been happier.  Having lived in the city for 15 years I was picky with our. hotel choice.  Room was large (NYC standards) clean with no signs of wear and tear.  Subway is right on corner which was perfect.  Staff was friendly not pretentious.  Room was well insulated from street noise.  Continental breakfast was generous with choices| everything was fresh.  Will stay again when we are in the city.,
3,Great Hotel in NYC.,The room was spacious for NYC. The entire staff was friendly. I would definitely recommend this hotel.     Great location.  Rooms were very quiet. Breakfast was great. Family friendly and close to the subway. ,
8,Birthday bash ,Fabulous stay at Hotel Giraffe.  Impeccable service and attention to detail. Thank you for making our visit and our guests feel so comfortable. You did manage the personal service very well.  Piano sessions were delightful and supported by cheese and wine. Worth planning your day around.  Look forward to a return trip. ,
2,Fantastic!,I chose the Hotel Giraffe during my recent stay in NYC to celebrate my daughter's 13th birthday. The staff were exceptionally friendly and accommodating and our rooms exceeded our expectations. Sipping a cappuccino on the rooftop garden was a welcome momentary escape while the group of tweens I was with enjoyed the delicious breakfast in the lobby. I recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the city whether the purpose is for business| romance or family!,
23,Fantastic family hotel,Excellent room| big| clean and very comfortable. Small balcony so you can open up the room for some air and hear the sounds of the city. Amazing team who looked after our every need. Great location| right next to Madison Square which is perfect for kicking back and having a coffee or shake. The attached Italian restaurant is perfect for evening meals and there's a fantastic Mexican just next door which gets busy| so book. Breakfast is simple continental but all you need. Afternoon wine| nibbles and coffee whenever you want it seal the deal. Thanks for making our trip just perfect.,
1,A perfect stay in NYC,Simply loved hotel Giraffe| could not been better! Location and service was amazing!  Rooms clean and comfortable| did not miss a thing. Loved the cheese| olives and wine every afternoon! And loved the rooftop! ,
4,Giraffe Hotel,Lovely boutique hotel. Very nice continental-plus breakfast and nice afternoon reception as well. Nice turndown service.  Staff terrific.  Only downside is slowness of the elevators and bathroom countertops are old-style low rather than modern high.,
52,Amazing In Every Way,We have just returned from our 12 night stay at Hotel Giraffe. The perfect hotel for two friends sharing with good size twin double beds| large bathroom and also space to spread out. The Hotel itself is in a ripping location to many good restaurants and also the Subways going either up or downtown. We enjoyed the cheese and wine which was complementary each evening and also the breakfast each day. Could not recommend the Hotel my highly and will definitely be recommending the hotel to family & friends staying in NYC,
1,Awesome stay,This is place is great. Service is excellent| location is ideal| beds are comfy. Not much I would really say I didn't like. There was a woman| Gabriele I believe? who was one of the nicest hotel workers I have ever encountered. Consistently friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel.,
6,Off-hand front desk,"Just spent 4 mights at the Hotel Giraffe New York. Very disappointed that our room was cleaned only once during our stay. This| according to the quite snippy receptionist was because ""the rooms of arriving guests are given priority""| and that I should “ask” to have our room serviced! Quite a first being classified as a low priority guest for staying more than one night.  But| ignoring the many other minor irritations of small rooms| a small bathroom| with small towels| and not enough of them (unchanged and wet in our case) a leaky fabric shower curtain| the tatty blinds and black outs that didn't quite fit| and being cold at night from the wafer thin duvet. The absolute clincher came when calling down to reception in the early hours to ask for a taxi to the airport| only to be…",
77,Second time here- perfect again,I spent 3 nights here and had a wonderful experience. The room was tastefully decorated| very quiet and comfortable and the staff was very helpful. The lobby is a lovely spot to hang out. Breakfast is served there- continental but plenty| as well as a happy hour time of wine and snacks and hot tea| coffee and cookies/fruit available at other times of day. The location can't be beat.,
415,Hard to fault,We arrived late afternoon after a lengthy flight. Check-in was a swift| painless and informative process. By the time we were done there| we had a reservation for dinner downstairs at Bread & Tulips| knew when to join the daily wine and food tasting| and felt confident that nothing much would phase the crew manning the front desk. Our room was on the 9th floor| looking across 26th Street. A small outside balcony| good for photos but not large enough to sit out. Well equipped though small room| and a tidy and functional bathroom. In room safe| coffee machine and plenty of hanging space were all pluses. Much to like| and nothing really to fault. And yes| the wine and cheese each afternoon| from 5pm| was worth seeking out.,
22,EXCELLENT LOCATION! 4.5 stars. Nice rooms| friendly staff| GREAT value. (continental breakfast + evening wine included!),IF Trip Advisor would allow half stars I would have given 4.5. I gave 4 out of 5 stars because to get 5 a property must excel at all core elements or get darn close to perfect. I have broken down essentials with individual star ratings. If it was less than 5 Star I explain why. Bottom line| BOOK this hotel. It is great. The handful of non-perfect items was exceeded by 5 Star items and is by far no reason to not stay here again. GREAT JOB Giraffe!  Cleanliness: 5 star  Location: 5+ star - You cannot get any better location - Close to subway/train - Close to great restaurants| bars. major attraction within walk distance  Staff Courteousness: 5 star  (especially the sweet Slovenian lady (not sure if I can mention names?) who serves up coffee and toast at the morning Continental…,
1,My NYC Home,When you walk in the door you are home. Better than home| actually. Home fully staffed and finely attuned to all your needs. From your preferences being remembered to anticipating your next need the staff here is delightful. The view from the roof is great and you're within walking distance of the flatiron building.,
1,Birthday bash,Went to celebrate my daughter's 21st birthday. The hotel and it's amenities made the trip absolutely perfect. We particularly enjoyed the breakfast and afternoon happy hour. It was a great way to start our day and then to relax in the afternoon before our night activities.,
5,Another great stay at The Giraffe,We have come to NYC every spring for many years and have stayed at The Giraffe every time since we discovered it. The rooms are nice although they could use a refresh| the only complaint we had this trip was the weather. The lady that runs the wine and snacks in the evening deserves a special compliment as she makes us feel right at home. ,
17,My favorite hotel in Manhattan,I can't say enough good things about this hotel.  If you're looking for a great midtown location| intimate attention to detail from all staff| lovely rooms| great value| you'll find everything you need here!  Quiet elegance.  Walking distance to lots and lots of shopping| dining and attractions. Easy cab/Uber ride to anywhere else. If you're looking for hip| slick and cool with all the action| this probably isn't for you.  But the Hotel Giraffe filled our every need and exceeded our expectations!,
12,Perfect!,"Staff at Hotel Giraffe was extremely friendly and helpful.  Family of 4| includes 2 teenage boys| stayed in a King Suite and it was perfect for us.  We were given a mattress topper for the pullout and it was plenty comfortable.  Room temperature easily controllable| bathroom so nice and roomy| turn-down service| chocolates and waters appreciated after a long day in the city.  Location makes walking everywhere doable.  Breakfast had many options for even the pickiest of eaters.  Coffee| tea and sweets available throughout the day is a very nice touch.  More than enough storage space in room.  Never had an issue with street noise.  But if you do| just turn the fan to ""on"" on the room temperature controls and you won't hear a thing.  Ron| the reservations manager| was SO helpful…",
181,Nicely done| but NYC is noisy,Very nice place with outstanding service and a large suite (with sofa bed). Good breakfast included| as is the wine and cheese in the afternoon.  I highly recommend it.  Negatives: It takes 40 minutes to get your car from the valet.  They warn you about this when you give your keys| but still... NYC is noisy. Make sure you get a high floor.,
254,Above and Beyond....,Our First stay at the Hotel Giraffe.  This stay was fantastic.  The staff were always willing to go above and beyond the call of duty.  Hotel offers breakfast daily| wifi| and snacks throughout the day.  Definitely worth the trip.,
34,Excellent hotel,Spent 4 nights at the Giraffe Hotel on 26th and Park. Excellent  boutique hotel. We had a very nice room with a balcony overlooking Park Ave. Centrally located as only 2 blocks from a subway station and even walking distance to many sites for the hearty. We walked twice from the hotel| once to Chelsea Marketplace (excellent!) and once to Central Park and then back down Broadway. It was about 2.5-3 miles to Central Park for a walk. But you get to see the city on foot! The staff at the Giraffe was fantastic| especially the lady serving cocktails and appetizers every night! They offer 20% off for the restaurant next door| Bread and Tulips which was fantastic too. Really enjoyed our stay here and highly recommended.,
3,We had a wonderful stay in NYC!,Our family of four enjoyed everything about Hotel Giraffe.  The breakfast was delicious and the wine/cheese generous.  The room was comfortable with plenty of room for us all.  The service was excellent and the staff knowledgeable!  Would return in a minute!!,
54,Excellent hotel at 26th and Park,I recently stayed at Hotel Giraffe with my daughter and mother in a queen balcony suite. The room was plenty big enough for three adults and all of our stuff (new shopping included!) The room was extremely comfortable and quiet. Shower had great water pressure and plenty of hot water. The towels needed to be a bit bigger but that wasn't a big deal. We went in mid-March so the weather was frigid one day and comfy the next...the heat and a/c worked equally well. Great continental breakfast in the morning and wonderful coffee| lattes| and cappuccinos as a part of that. The complimentary happy hour was great too. Each night when we would come in from a show| there were always goodies waiting in the lobby. The staff could not have been more professional or more accommodating. I would…,
1,A Wonderful Experience,The Hotel Giraffe far exceeded my expectations.  I was so happy with our suite -- the bed and linens were great.  The bathroom was very comfortable.  The staff attended to our every need.  The breakfast and happy hour was a real bonus.  The staff were very hospitable and personable.   The hotel is well located| near restaurants and a park.  Highly recommended.,
13,Lovely| hospitable boutique hotel,Hotel Giraffe is comfortable| warm and welcoming.  Location is great for walking and subway. Nice restaurants nearby. I wish the weather cooperated so we could have enjoyed the roof deck. Daily amenities include a great continental breakfast and wine and cheese reception.  The staff are all very accommodating| but Gabriela is exceptional! This was our second visit and we will definitely be back again.,
6,Small Lovely hotel close to everything!,Great atmosphere| friendly happy and personable staff and impeccably clean rooms.  Lovely breakfast and evening cocktails!  I plan to stay there again.   For New York City the hotel Giraffe can't be beat. ,
1,"Great location and ""extras""",Really appreciated the breakfast| snacks and Happy Hour that were included! Close enough to all the action - but in a quiet section. 230 fifth was a great rooftop bar and close to Madison Square Park and the Flatiron Building,
2,Really great visit to MYC.,"Great location. Enjoyed the wine and cheese before our shows. Front desk was lots of help for restaurants/directions. They handled a ""visitor"" at breakfast very well. Breakfast service was very quick and friendly. Comfortable room for 3 of us. Thanks.",
151,Gracious boutique hotel in NoMad,The Giraffe is a lovely boutique hotel well-located in the NoMad neighborhood. We were able to walk everywhere! The rooms are very comfortable and well-appointed. Very quiet| too| even though we were across from the elevator. Though the breakfast was continental as promised| we would have liked a few more protein options. The evening wine and cheese was very nicely done. Service was most gracious.,
148,Good strategy,My daughter treated me to 5 days in Manhattan and selected this hotel from a number she looked at. Excellent choice. At first we were baffled at the lack of Guest Info book which you get in every hotel and the explanation seemed a bit of a duff excuse for an oversight. But as time went on we understood their strategy: this was not a sterile hotel like others but they have tried to make it more like the cliched 'home from home' and it actually does work very well. The evening receptions give you the opportunity to mix with other guests if you wish| the staff are super without being unctious and all in all a very successful market positioning. Would not hesitate to recommend.,
2,Thank you from Australia,Thank you to your excellent staff especially to Gabriella who made our trip to NY just fabulous.   5 adults| 3 lovely rooms and our trip of 10 days was outstanding.    Congratulations Hotel Giraffe for making our stay easy and more than enjoyable.  We will definitely be recommending this hotel to all our Australian friends.,
30,Everything we expected and more ,Went for birthday weekend in NYC. Looked long and hard at options and loved the website and other reviews. Everything we hoped in terms of location comfort and service! Nice personal touches including unrequested chilled champagne for my wife on arrival! Nice afternoon wine service with friendly servers. Walk to great wine bars restaurants. Quick Uber to any site. Only negative was weather| otherwise we could have walked much more.,
1,Excellent hotel,"The room was very clean and comfortable| a bit noisy from the street. Good location. We tried the ""external"" health club that was included| far better than small hotel healthclubs. Very serviceminded and friendly staff. Great breakfast and wine/cheese reception in the afternoon. We arrived one day later because of the snowstorm but we did not have to pay for the room or any penalty. ",
38,Wonderful and Warm,This hotel is my new favorite in NYC. They got everything right- good location yet slightly off the beaten path| staff is warm and welcoming| amenities are A++| rooms are large for NYC standards| and the balcony in a double room offers a little fresh air and a view. It's small and boutiquey enough to add that personal touch yet large enough to have everything you want and need. What made me give it 5 stars instead of 4 was the staff- professional yet very friendly and warm| sometimes that is what is lacking in other hotels in the area.,
1,Welcome Oasis in the City,Charming boutique hotel that offers quality service.  Hotel Giraffe makes you feel welcome from the moment you step in the door with warm| friendly smiles and outstanding customer service.  There are many hotels to choose from in New York City| but what makes Hotel Giraffe special is the 'attention to detail' quality provided to each guest.  From the daily continental breakfast| nightly wine reception| and 24 hour access to complimentary cookies| tea| and coffee| this hotel is truly a gem.  The Hotel Giraffe staff is top notch and a special thanks to Gabriela for providing great service during breakfast and also at evening wine reception.  She is a wonderful asset to the staff. We will choose Hotel Giraffe again the next time we are in New York.,
37,Lovely Boutique Hotel,I only stayed one night| but wish I could have stayed longer. I was in NYC on business and chose this hotel because it was near my business function| and I'm glad I did. This is a lovely boutique hotel with a European feel. A gem in NYC| and I'll stay here again the next time I'm in the city.,
3,Perfect stay!,Hotel Giraffe is about as perfect as a boutique hotel can be!  In busy NYC| at this hotel you feel like you found a a quiet| elegant oasis.  From the staff| the lovely decorated rooms| the rooftop garden and the cocktail hour and breakfast everything is directed at making you feel comfy and at home! Highly recommended.,
79,Amazing First Time Stay,I commute and go into the city often and never noticed this hotel on Park Ave.  My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and had dinner reservations in Union Square.  The hotel is just a few blocks away and in a great spot.  The people at the front desk checked us in quickly| congratulated us and upgraded our room!  The room size seemed large for that location.  Plenty of bathroom space and closet space and a large desk in the front of the room was perfect to drop everything on.  A bottle of wine was brought up to our room which was super nice!  The wine and cheese receptions was great!  They had a white| red and champagne option with cheese and crackers and the attendant was on top of everything- making sure your glass was full and plates were cleared.  After our…,
2,Excellent year after year,The Giraffe is perfectly located for our activities in NYC. The subway is 2-3 blocks away. The staff is friendly and remembers us from previous visits -- it's like coming home. The rooms are clean and well appointed.  I love the light breakfast and the wine and cheese offering every evening.  Coffee| tea| cookies and fruit are always available in the lobby.   I love this boutique hotel.,
3,Spring Vacation,This is by far my favorite New York hotel. It's not an overly large property| definitely boutique but you never feel claustrophobic here. The rooms are HUGE by NYC standards and spotlessly clean. Bathroom has plenty of counter space| instant hot water| shower/tub combo. Lots of drawers in the dresser/armoire. They have a very generous wine and cheese hour that goes from 5-7 each night. The crowd is an older set visiting from many different countries. We didn't see many children which was a plus. It's definitely catering to ages 40-70. Very safe area and easy transportation options from subway to taxis. Numerous eating options nearby. Check-in/checkout were a breeze. Very friendly staff. Wonderful experience.,
99,Completely Average in All Respects,Hotel Giraffe looked too good to be true on paper| and as it turns out it was. Some clever photography makes the rooms look much bigger than an average New York City hotel room... which is simply not the case. Its location is also not quite what we were looking for which is on us more than the hotel. The Hotel Giraffe was a great reminder that if something looks too good to be true then in reality... it is probably completely average. A little more perusing of websites would have revealed some better options,
5,Delightful Experience,We spent this past weekend at the Hotel Giraffe.  This was our second stay at this hotel.  As with our first stay| this was also a totally delightful experience.  The staff at the hotel are among the friendliest and most helpful I have encountered in staying at various hotels.  We were last here a year ago and were greeted by the hotel staff as old friends. I would especially like to compliment Gabrielle who is so engaging and helpful and Jose who helped us with our arrival and exit.  The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are extremely comfortable.  This year we had a suite which was wonderful.  The amenities are incredible from the wine and cheese receptions each evening to the delicious breakfasts each morning.  This is the finest hotel in which we have stayed in New York City.…,
7,Wonderful Hotel,Our family stayed for three days in February. This is such a fine hotel and it suited our needs perfectly. We met in the lobby at breakfast and at happy hour and were never rushed and always welcomed. The rooms were spotlessly clean and the beds very comfortable. The staff is excellent| especially the breakfast and happy hour staff. We also liked the neighbourhood. Highly recommended.,
1,Snowstorm in NYC,The rooms are spotless| and the staff is so friendly. Gabriela even remembered us from our previous visit in 2015! Our stay was extended by 3 additional nights due to the storm. The staff was gracious in coordinating the additional nights without having to change rooms. They also found and returned a forgotten item promptly. We highly recommend Hotel Giraffe.,
2,A Gem in Manhattan,Wonderful boutique European hotel. Great breakfast and evening wine and cheese with piano. Will return again and again as it feels intimate in a busy city. Rooms with balconies and a rooftop green terrace. Would recommend a suite.,
5,The Best,This is the best place in NYC to stay for the value.  Great service| terrific breakfast and wine and cheese| good location. It is also easy place to catch transportation---taxis| subway| busses.  If we have the choice| we always stay here.,
16,Loved it!,We stayed here for a weekend getaway.  Location is great| close to the N & R. Staff was so helpful and friendly.  Every evening they have wine and cheese (no charge)| there is always something snacky in the lobby| coffee is always available| also with no charge. There is a breakfast in the lobby that is included - simple but delicious.  I had initially been put off by the cost of the room| but there were no nickel and dime charges.  Great place.,
124,Outstanding boutique hotel,The staff at the hotel were very helpful and friendly. We were travelling right before a snowstorm and flew in a day earlier than expected. Despite the fact that the price had gone up significantly since our original booking| they gave us the price that we payed for the other nights anyways. The room was clean| and fairly spacious for New York. There was a balcony| a chest of drawers| desks etc. In the lobby the hotel serves a continental breakfast every morning for free. It has grapefruit| orange and cranberry juice| servers bring you tea or coffee and there are pastries| bagels| toast and cereal. There are snacks and hot drinks available throughout the day and wine and cheese are served every evening with live piano music. The concierge helped us with a lot of planning as…,
1,Outstanding service,"We loved Hotel Giraffe and will recommend your establishment to all of our family and friends. The location was perfect for our itinerary. The staff was extremely welcoming| friendly helpful and accommodating . The lobby and our room was beautifully decorated. The associated restaurant ""Bread and Tulips"" was outstanding as well | with a great menu for my family and I. Later visiting friends and I had drinks at the bar until they closed!! Wonderful place to stay!!!",
38,Wonderful boutique hotel ,We stayed in a king bed suite for spring break with our college-age daughter. What a great room! Actual one bedroom suite. Plenty of closets| nice view| all the luxury amenities. Plus| even with the fold-out couch made up as a bed there was plenty of space to walk around. Very convenient to have breakfast provided. We were never around for the wine and cheese but I'd expect it to be great as well. Attentive staff| no complaints. We were on a low floor so we heard some street noise but it wasn't bad. Definitely would stay here again. Not a lot of tourist spots in the immediate neighborhood so we lyfted everywhere. ,
1,Best boutique hotel,The Giraffe is heads above them all! I love everything about this hotel - the breakfast| afternoon wine and cheese| consierge service| beautiful rooms| attentive housekeeping| and most of all the delightful staff. ,
1,Not too impressed,I thought I was going to be wowed by the reviews but I was ehhed. 1)concierges do not do anything special to find tix| etc.  They basically told me they go on the internet to look up for tickets and basically I could do that but they would be happy to print them. 2)we got heated out of our room. I understand it was cold outside but why bother having a controller in the rooms if u really aren't controlling the air/heat?  It runs on their schedule and just an fyi| the air does not work in the winter which is bad when u have a daughter who has issues with heat blowing in her face and then can't breathe. 3) when we called because of the air issue| I tried to to talk to Gabby and she couldn't get me off the phone fast enough -- no customer service. She was probably busy but could…,
17,Cozy Lovely Charming,My husband and 2 sons had a 2 queen juliet balcony room on the 7th floor for 4 nights.  The continental breakfast each morning in the lobby was a life saver and a wonderful spread. The wine and cheese was a wonderful perk each afternoon.  How can you beat that? I loved the simplicity of design of the rooms and the hotel itself.  Unpretentious and easygoing. It was so relaxing in the lobby| and the hustle and bustle is left behind when you stay at this small boutique hotel where there is a feel of more personalized service.  Great location with many good restaurants and stores all around. Would like to stay here again!,
1,Sisters' Weekend Getaway,Hotel Giraffe is a quaint boutique hotel that provides top notch customer service and pleasing amenities for guests. My sister and I had a lovely room on an upper floor. The room was clean| comfortable| and spacious. We enjoyed the complimentary daily breakfast and wine and hors d'oeuvres in the early evenings. The hotel is located close to public transport and within walking distance to many landmarks| cafes| restaurants| and shops. Would definitely stay at Hotel Giraffe again and try another property in the Library Hotel Collection.,
7,A Quiet Treasure,I absolutely love the Hotel Giraffe.   I've stayed there at least 10 times and like it more each time.  The rooms are generous in size for NYC and beautifully maintained.   I really love the complimentary breakfast and happy hour...really well done.  And the staff is always willing to help.    I highly recommend this place !!,
1,My new favorite hotel place to stay in NYC!,Great hotel! Everyone was friendly and very accommodating! Parking was easy.. And lots of great restaurants are close by. The room was very clean! Breakfast was served until 11 and was delicious!! Coffee and espresso were served all day!,
2,Had A Perfect Stay,Everything was great. I am a hotel snob and the best way to sum up my 4 night experience is to say I would stay here again as well as refer friends and family here. I look forward to returning. Thank you to all the staff for the royal treatment.,
3,Best Hotel in NYC - BY FAR!!,Hotel Giraffe was fantastic!! We stayed here for over 10 nights and it was amazing. Rooms were big and the room was incredibly welcoming. The housekeeping were fantastic and cleaned the room every day as well as did a turn down service every night.   The wine / cheese every evening was very much appreciated and we would like to say a special mention to Gabriella who ran these nights - she was welcoming and always so polite and friendly. She was wonderful.  Hotel Giraffe is in the best location and we had a great time. We will be letting all our friends know about it and we will definitely stay here in the future!!   Thanks so much Hotel Giraffe for everything!!,
1,Excellent Hotel!,All these rave reviews are true - I had a great experience at Hotel Giraffe. It's a great location near union square park/Flatiron and the subway right there. The room was well-appointed and spacious. Lots of storage space from closets to drawers| and more bathroom storage than you usually see: a drawer| a long shelf and a huge counter. Several comfy chairs and a great bed.  Very quiet too and great room to room isolation and triple windows kept the NYC noise to a minimum. Comfy lobby and nice roof deck. Staff was welcoming and helpful at al times. Excellent breakfast and cheese and snacks with wine in the evening. And cookies! Not the cheapest| but first hotel ever where I had no complaints at all. Oh| a bit of reupholstering is in order| but that's minor. You'll really like…,
20,Spring break/ college tour,Love this hotel!!! Staying a month in July and just spent another week here. Great service| location| staff| breakfast and happy hour 💁🏾 Also got to see The Obamas while here they had lunch across the street 👏🏾👏🏾😀,
1,Hotel for road warriors,An excellent hotel and staff for road warriors visiting NYC for business. The location of the hotel makes it ideal to find quick meals or long business dinners. The staff will always treat you like this is your home away from home. ,
453,My Go To Hotel In NYC,This was my third stay.  Still great.  Service and the extras make the hotel what it is plus comfortable rooms.  They cut back on the happy hour a bit by no longer serving sliced meats but maybe this was not permanent.  I don't have one single negative thing to say about this hotel after 3 stays.,
824,Tall in name| tall in service,Above all this hotel scores top on service. Very friendly staff  - in particular the ladies who worked very hard with a smile at breakfast and the evening drinks.   The hotel has a small foyer which doubles as a seating area for breakfast and evening drinks. In the evening there is someone playing the piano.  Our room was a queen room on the 8th floor. Clean and well laid out with a balcony. The bathroom was very small with a shower over the bath and a curtain. The room was very warm so we had to have the balcony door open. It's very noisy with the door open but nothing you would not expect from a city hotel location.   On arrival we got 2 small bottles of water in our room but then after that only got one bottle each day. There is no coffee/tea in the room unless you ask for a…,
11,Excellent Small Hotel in Midtown,My family enjoyed a wonderful long weekend at Hotel Giraffe.  From the courteous staff to the perfect location| it could hardly have been better.  Complimentary breakfast got us started in the morning (especially the BEST hot chocolate according to my kid) and afternoon wine and cheese gave a perfect place to relax later.  A small technical problem with our door key only gave the staff a chance to show how much they wanted our stay to be special - and they did.,
4,Lovely Manhattan hotel!,The service and amenities at Hotel Giraffe are top-notch| and the location is perfect - just a short walk or quick cab ride to everywhere we wanted to visit. Each and every staff member was so friendly and welcoming| and gave excellent recommendations when we asked for them| both before our stay (via email) and during. I can't imagine staying anywhere else for future visits to NYC - thank you for making our visit so lovely!,
17,NYC Celebration,We gathered in NYC to celebrate a birthday with our sons and daughter in laws. Hotel Giraffe was a wonderful choice. The staff was friendly and we found the rooms to be lovely and welcoming. The location allowed for easy access by foot or subway or cab to many popular sites. The inclusive breakfast was a treat| as was the wine and cheese reception nightly.  All in all| a place we will certainly return to!,
1,Small gem in Manhattan,Wonderful staff  and atmosphere. Convenient location. Easy breakfast. Location if perfect for anything below 42nd Street for easy walking. Rooms offer everything you need. This was our fourth stay in the last couple of years and quality remains consistently good. We belong to several hotel loyalty programs but prefer staying here when in New York. Terrific people.,
1,Loved the stay!,We all loved EVERYTHING about Hotel Giraffe.  We will surely stay there every time we visit NY.  There was not ONE complaint about a thing.  The staff was also incredibly helpful and kind.  The location is wonderful.  Thanks very much!,
7,My new favorite hotel,As we were driving down Park Avenue| I could spot Hotel Giraffe a block away because the building's exterior looked like a giraffe! From that moment| I knew this hotel was going to be special.  Of course| the hotel staff were all very friendly| but there were so many other little extras that just made the difference. The lobby was comfortable and welcoming and included all day snacks| coffee/tea| a wine hour| and breakfast.  Our room was a good size for a New York hotel room and was very clean and nicely decorated. The room included a small balcony| Sony TV (not your typical LG)| a super comfortable bed| and a very quiet heating system.  The bathroom was modern and had plush towels| and included a glass shelf that ran along the top of the sink area for toiletry items to avoid…,
13,A superb hotel,"Having recently stayed five nights| my wife and I are excited to have found a new home base for our trips to NYC. We reserved a ""classic king suite"" and found it to be both attractive and comfortable. The hotel staff members were uniformly warm and attentive| and the concierge services were particularly helpful.",
188,Very special place in NYC,Most big city hotels are often less than expected. Even the good ones.  This is completely an exception to that.  This is an absolute gem.  A work colleague and I stayed here for two days of meeting in town and then stayed for pleasure with my wife joining me for a couple of more days. This place gets service.  The rooms are calm| well appointed and clean as a pin. The lobby small| but intimate| friendly| has a great but casual euro vibe. Breakfast| coffee and evening food service is perfect. Location cannot be beat.  And the price is right.  We stayed in a king standard which was ample for our needs.   Loved the little balcony. Next time we will try to get room 1202.  Top floor suite with a walk out to the balcony. Well done Giraffe. It is rare indeed to build something of this…,
212,A New favorite Hotel in NYC,This is a wonderful Hotel that is part of the Library collection. impeccable service| great location and excellent quality of room and extras. The complimentary breakfast and happy hour service is a excellent added bonus and the hostess was friendly and attentive. I would recommend this hotel to everyone. We had a balcony king room which overlooked park avenue and the beautiful old NY life building.,
1,Feels Like Home,I have stayed in many New York Hotels but the Giraffe has that feel that you are always welcome. The staff from the doorman Jose to your front desk personal and the group  that serve you breakfast all are  warm| friendly and accommodating. They make our stay so enjoyable.,
1,Excellent hotel,This hotel is in a perfect location for all main sightseeing and close to good restaurants and bars. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is complimentary with a good selection and the bagels are very nice! There is complimentary cookies| pastries and tea and coffee all day and cheese| wine and prosecco between 5pm and 8pm. We couldn't have asked for a better hotel! Would definitely stay here again!,
1,absolutely delightful,A delightful quiet oasis in a terrific NYC location.  As two 50-ish couples on a NYC vacation weekend| we were looking for a comfortable| nicely-located hotel with a little extra luxury.  The Giraffe is certainly that!  The rooms are really comfortable| classy| large by NYC standards| with everything you'd expect| but what really did it for us was the delightful wine/appetizer/cheese reception Saturday afternoon| and truly wonderful continental breakfast Sunday morning in the lobby.  Much higher quality food than we expected| bright spacious lobby| a nice chance to visit with other guests| very attentive and personable servers.  The reception staff was equally welcoming and helpful.  The hotel is also centrally near many good restaurants| and a reasonable walk from Grand Central…,
54,Cute and comfortable stay,Loved our room here! Make happy hour if you can. We loved the piano music and glass of wine with our side of cheese and crackers.   The location was perfect for grabbing a cab or walking| which we did a lot of. The customer service was incredibly nice and accommodating. We had requested early check in and we had access to our room quicker than we had expected. Highly recommend this hotel!,
453,Good.,The bathtub was not clean| with remnants of the previous guest. Normally this is a no-go item and the rest is trivia. Yet the hotel is located in a good place| rooms are spacious and staff very helpful. Breakfast is cute but not filling enough. I liked the hotel and did not want to rank it average| mainly because of the price tag| which is very good for NY. Well worth the Money but management should be vary of housekeeping.,
20,Couldn't recommend more,I visited this hotel on a trip to New York to celebrate my parents 25th wedding anniversary.  I must say I was not let down:  The rooms are clean and attractive and housekeeping are friendly and do a professional job.  The complimentary breakfast has bagels| yogurts| fruit (fresh and salad)| bread| spreads and preserves and a wide range of cereals to cater to everyones taste. There is a member of staff present to cut and toast bagels.  The wine and cheese reception runs on an evening - serving free flowing white wine| red wine and procecco and a wide selection of cheese and crackers| vegetables and a fresh dressing. A particular member of staff| Gabriella| went above and beyond to ensure you had a fantastic experience. As soon as you finished your last drop of wine she would…,
99,Good location| clean| modern. Breakfast included!,The Giraffe has a great location. Close to a subway station and in the middle of everything. Nothing is really far away. Macy's is a 10-15min walk| Times Square 20min. The hotel serves a small breakfast every day and wine and cheese in the pre-evening. The rooms are clean| quite large and fresh. If you're not used to city hustle and bustle you might need earplugs| but during saturday-sunday it was very quiet| I suspect it's because the nearby Baruch college settles down for the weekend. The lobby and elevators are stroller and wheelchair accessible| no stairs from the street. There is a restaurant in the same building| we didn't have food there but heard it was good. So was the restaurant across the street!,
1,Mr. Mark McDonagh,The hotel was comfortable| and a home from home. the staff were excellent and extremely helpful and polite. We had a thoroughly enjoyable stay and would receomend this hotel to any family or friends planning a trip to New York.,
31,Stellar boutique hotel,Absolutely wonderful and beautiful hotel on Park Avenue. So close to numerous places. The staff was so nice| helpful| and pleasant. Wonderful continental breakfast in the morning| great valet parking...perfect place to take in NYC,
517,Extremely Comfortable,Stayed 2 nights in a King Suite with a balcony overlooking Park Avenue. It was a really comfortable suite - both the big bed and the bed settee. Room maids were charming and helpful as was the lovely lady running the excellent evening buffet. Breakfast was great and all day drinks and snacks very much appreciated. This is a really great value for money Hotel which I can thoroughly recommend.,
1,I will be back,Excellent location. Beautiful room| clean and fresh. Huge clean bathroom. Do not hesitate to book here| it is so close to Gramercy Tavern and Eataly. The staff is super friendly. Enjoy any variety of coffee or espresso all day along with free baked goods.  I will be back. ,
1,Great Spot!,Great boutique Hotel in a great location... Terrific service and a friendly| helpful staff who were available at all times. Room was clean and nice with a balcony overlooking Park Avenue South.  There is a nice rooftop garden and bar along and a nice lower floor restaurant. Didn't love the Tv Stand/Desk in the room| but the little bar area and bathroom were nice! It's NYC so there are restaurants everywhere| but there are a bunch of tremendous options all within a block or two from the hotel.  Overall a great stay!!,
1,Change to policy,I have always booked Hotel Giraffe as they offer balcony rooms| that allow for easy access for smokers (Gross| I know| blah blah blah) without disrupting others.   Upon my last trip I was informed that this was no longer allowed on the property| and as a result I may need to look into other options in the Flat Iron/Kips Bay area| that accommodate said preference.  Otherwise tis is a great boutique hotel| sad to see my business go elsewhere| as it is a detail that does not impede on anyone other than my own lungs| haha.,
1,Great hotel,We were looking for a comfortable hotel below 42nd st. Hotel on Park Avenue.  Great service. Suite was surprisingly quiet. Well fitted out. Recommend this hotel as good value. Enjoyed complimentary access to coffee| snack and fruit 24 hours in the lobby with espresso coffee machine.,
1,Best NYC Hotel Stay,This small hotel has it all: central location| comfortable room (relatively spacious for NYC)| well-maintained| friendly and helpful staff| great breakfast included| and a good value. I'll stay here again when in NYC.,
1,Exceeded our expectations!!,We heard about Hotel Giraffe through a friend. We were a little skeptical because the rates were so reasonable.   Bed was  extremely comfortable| the room was clean and up to date| and the happy hour   wine and cheese was great!!,
50,Nice Stay,The hotel is in an excellent location two blocks from 28th subway. Walking distance to flatiron and framer you park. Lots around the area. Our room had very thin windows letting in cold air and noise. We had to sleep with heater on to combat the draft. Super noisy 3rd floor along 26th street. The wine and breakfast were great. The staff was very nice and helpful.,
4,Favorite Hotel,Love staying at this hotel. The staff is so friendly. It is in a convenient location. I would recommend this hotel for everyone Breakfast is good-not too heave or light. It is a perfect way to start the day. After being out all day come back and enjoy wine. ,
8,Excellent hotel in fantastic location,We spent 5 days in Hotel Giraffe and we were looked after by friendly and informative staff.Breakfast was ideal with fresh coffee |croissants|bagels|boiled eggs and lots of fresh fruit. In the evening there was a selection of cheeses |wine and proseco hosted by Gabrielle from 5pm until 8 pm .I really enjoyed the piano playing in the background|but what made the evening was the personal touches by Gabrielle|who always remembered your favourite drink and asked about the the events of your day.Highly recommend this hotel .,
116,Can't wait to come back!!!,Look no further! This hotel has it ALL - great location (not in the busy hustle and bustle of Times Square| but located in a quieter area with great restaurants| a duane reade store on the same block| and quick walk to subway)| great customer service| we loved the breakfast each day and the wine and cheese reception each night| plus coffee and coffee drinks anytime in the lobby. The employees were all very helpful and professional| especially the lady working the wine reception each night of our stay - she was so friendly and an amazing host!! The rooms were comfortable and clean. We stayed 4 nights on the 4th floor and only heard loud street noise one of the nights we were there. I do recommend taking a white noise machine or something to help block out the street sounds below.…,
3,Amazing accommodations in NYC,I hosted my sons bar mitzvah last weekend and had my out of town guests stay at the giraffe. My family and friends loved it. The rooms were comfortable.  The amenities| especially the snacks and wine and cheese| were delicious And appreciated. Great location and helpful staff also made their visit enjoyable. ,
1,Excellent Hotel| Great Service,Superior service at this boutique hotel. I had a special occasion and it was handled with ease and care by Almira and Amanda. The rooms are well decorated and spacious and the extra amenities like wine and cheese and breakfast with a nice sitting area to read the paper or get some work done before meetings make it a great location. Thanks! ,
109,Very nice hotel ,Very nice| personally and friendly hotel with good location . Nice breakfast and good coffee. Soft towels and bathrobe. Near 23. And 28. Line 6 metro| perfect to see NY on day or night. Service er excellent.,
88,A Wonderful Experience!!!,The Hotel Giraffe is fabulous!  The staff is second to none!  It is a quaint| boutique hotel that is inviting| comfortable and friendly.  The continental breakfast is great and the service impeccable.  The hotel room was cozy| extremely clean and very comfortable.  The bedding was perfect and we slept like babies.  We stayed in a standard King room.  We didn't get the opportunity to experience the onsite restaurant| but it was so convenient and the menu looked wonderful.  We would definitely stay here again!,
19,GREAT HOTEL| EXCELLENT LOCATION| HIGHLY RECOMMEND STAYING HERE!!!!!,This Hotel is excellent. We never stayed in New York before| so we booked this Hotel off their reviews. We couldn't have been happier with our stay. From the moment we arrived| all of the staff was very friendly and helpful. We stayed on the 10th floor in a king suite| it was great. The room was very clean| the staff did an outstanding job cleaning and doing the nightly turn down service. We also had very little street noise which was nice. We enjoyed the morning continental breakfast on the days we had it. Also| each evening| we really enjoyed the wine and cheese in the lobby. The lobby has several tables| chairs and sofas to relax on. There was a piano player most nights| it was very enjoyable. This property is close to Grand Central Station| and not too far from Times Square.…,
116,It Felt Like Home!,We had a King Suite with Juliet balcony on the 3rd floor facing Park Ave. and 26th.  The room was clean| quiet| and comfortable.  We took full use of the mini-bar| fridge| robes| slippers| and complimentary mugs with hot chocolate (package deal).  I loved the room decor with the rose-colored chairs and comfortable King bed with requested down pillows.  It really felt like we were coming home after a long day of sightseeing and fun!  My favorite part of the Giraffe was the complimentary Wine & Cheese reception each night from 5-8 PM.  The lovely Gabriela was the sweetest hostess who made our evenings much more memorable.  I also appreciated the complimentary continental breakfast and the ability to get hot tea and treats 24-hours a day from the lobby. Check-out is 1:00 p.m.|…,
1,We will be back!,The hotel was perfect.  Housekeeping standards were immaculate.  Staff very friendly.  Room was beautifully appointed.  Amenities superior.  And how nice to receive a 20% discount at Bread and Tulip.  Food was excellent.,
53,A good hotel in a good location. ,Stayed with siblings in a triple room. It's located well and the room was comfortable and clean.   The breakfast was good and set you up for that day. Also you were able to get teas and coffees in the evenings.   Reception staff were ok but the doormen were really friendly.   Overall| I would recommend staying here. ,
1,Not quite perfect,The black-out shade did not cover the window| so the room never got completely dark (or completely quiet).  Otherwise| everything was lovely. The food available in the bar was welcome| as were the breakfasts.,
22,Relaxing haven in busy city,My husband and I stayed here last week arriving in New York to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary. We arrived to a card |wine and chocolate in the room which was a lovely gesture . I'd e mailed prior to our arrival requesting our own coffee machine and a high room facing Park avenue |each request was met | and the room was just lovely .  Continental breakfast in the morning was just perfect to set us up for our day and to arrive back at the hotel after a long day on our feet was wonderful to be able to sink into the sofa |kick off your boots and feel absolutely at home in this fab hotel whilst enjoying complimentary prosecco |wine  and cheese and nibbles .. and a massive shout out to the hostess Gabriella |she chatted and got to know all her guests and we loved that friendly…,
5,Valentine's Trip to NYC,Everything about the Hotel Giraffe was wonderful. Everyone was so accommodating and eager to help with suggestions. My husband had never been sight seeing in NY| Park Ave was in the middle of everything!,
18,Great stay,Hotel provided a car service from airport. Room was great with a small balcony overlooking Park Ave. Fun rooftop bar great for pre dinner drinks.They offer wine and cheese in the evenings. The location is good .Plenty of good restaurants within a 2 minute walk.,
10,Pleasureable Hotel,The hotel has been beautifully updated and the friendly helpful staff could not be nicer to guests. The smaller size of the hotel provides a pleasant feeling of home. The breakfast provided is the perfect start to your day with the staff providing personal service to each guest in the bright first floor sitting area. Late afternoon wine| cheese and fruit is very welcome after a busy day touring the many venues of NYC. ,
2,Great room,Overall excellent experience| friendly attentive staff| large clean rooms| welcoming evening wine and cheese.  My only disappointment was with the breakfast which ended up being a continental breakfast as opposed to a full breakfast.  The hotel promotion made it seem more than it was.,
3,Even during a snowstorm,"I LOVE this hotel & will definitely stay there the next time I'm in NYC! It was extremely quiet| the staff are superb| very friendly & helpful| and a comfortable rooms. I was ""stranded"" there 2 extra days recently due to cancelled flights from a heavy snow storm & they were very accommodating by letting me stay in my room those extra days!",
70,Oasis in the Big Apple,Love staying at this home away from home| when in NYC on business.  Nice size room| comfy bed| cool lobby| great lare day and breakfast snacks.  And convenient to where i do business.  Their Bread and Tulip restaurant is wonderful too,
2,Amazing Hotel & Staff,Everything was perfect! The hotel and rooms are beautiful. The staff is courteous| warm| and helpful. The wine and cheese afternoon hours are a huge| delightful bonus. Will definitely stay there again! ,
4,A sublime experience,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay at the Hotel Giraffe on Park Avenue in NYC.  Everything met or completely exceeded our expectations -- the location| the room (spacious by New York standards)| the ambiance| the service| the morning breakfast| and the evening wine and cheese reception.  The staff were extraordinarily attentive| effficient| and pleasant in every situation and interaction.  We especially enjoyed getting to know Gabrielle| who served us at all of the nightly wine and cheese receptions we were fortunate enough to attend.  We highly commend this wonderful hotel!,
129,Great Hotel Great Staff,This hotel was wonderful from check in to check out.  It is a small boutique hotel that is warm and welcoming.  We had two rooms| one a king bed room with a separate sitting area and another room with two queen beds.  Both rooms were very comfortable.  Nice linens and nice towels too. The queen room actually had a small balcony where we could stand outside and catch some fresh air.  The room was well appointed with whatever amenity you may need and what they did not have you could obtain downstairs.  A lovely breakfast was served every morning at 10:00am and cappuccino or tea and cookies are available around the clock.  Almost forgot to mention that wine and cheese is served everyday at 4:00pm.  Really nice to come back to the hotel to enjoy these amenities.  The restaurant…,
6,Favorite NYC hotel,We love the Hotel Giraffe and the staff always go out of their way to make us comfortable. The rooms are nice and comfortable and the wine and cheese and the complimentary breakfast are great! This is our favorite hotel and we stay here often. ,
429,Good value and friendly staff ,We spent 5 nights here in early feb. The hotel itself is lovely and the staff are all very friendly and accommodating. They offer a complimentary wine and cheese hour to guests which runs from 5 - 8  which is delicious and also have a continental breakfast. The room itself wasn't too big but that's expected in New York. The bed however was a bit on the smaller side. It was fairly quiet and we were able to sleep peacefully. The staff at the front desk were helpful with any queries we had. Complimentary wifi which was strong. Room service is available but pretty limited. It's in a fairly good location with it positioned between upper Manhatten and Brooklyn.,
1,Recent Stay at Hotel Giraffe in NYC,I enjoyed my recent stay in your hotel in NY.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful.  My room was very comfortable and tastefully decorated.  I especially enjoyed having a balcony.  I thought the complimentary wine and cheese reception offered in the afternoons was great and very much appreciated after a long day at work.  I would stay at this hotel again in the future.,
36,Amazing stay at Hotel Giraffe,What a great find on Park Avenue at 26th St. From check-in to check-out| the service and the staff were professional| helpful and friendly. Loved our room--huge for Manhattan with a nice little balcony. It has the feel of a neat little boutique hotel and the wine and cheese reception each evening was a special touch| along with the continental breakfast and great coffee bar.  I highly recommend staying at this hotel--great value for the price and great location. I wish I could have stayed longer. I travel for business all over the world and stay in numerous hotels. Hotel Giraffe ranks among the top for me!,
7,My new FAVORITE hotel in NYC,I've staying at dozens of hotels in NYC and Hotel Giraffe is my new favorite. LOVE Boutique hotels and this one exceeded all of my expectations. Love the free Breakfast and the fact that is was available well past 10:30 am - so we didn't have to rush. Great selection of pastries| bagels| cereal - Plus Oatmeal| fresh fruit| yogert| etc. The Coffee was great & the staff running it was wonderful and very helpful. A nice treat was the cookies set out in the afternoon. Plus - they even have a Wine & Cheese reception every evening. Such a nice surprise. The rooms were beautifully appointed. High quality linens and dark wood - just beautiful.  The bed was SO comfortable - I slept so well. Large rooms as well! We had an abundance of closet space and it was all very clean.  Great…,
252,Another Gem of a Hotel,We stayed at the Giraffe in January when rates were relatively low.  We had a king suite and it was very comfortable and roomy by New York standards.  The two room suite (ending in -01) had a bedroom window on the street and a window on the air shaft.  (The suites that end with -06 have two windows on the street and therefor have more light| but also a little more noise).    The lobby is lovely and the site of the morning continental breakfast and happy hour wine and cheese service.  They provided bottled water every day in our room (no extra charge) and generally were very welcoming.  Like the other hotels in this group the staff was very attentive and helpful.    The bed was comfortable and we slept well in general without too much street noise. We found it to be a convenient…,
12,The Best Weekend,"Hotel Giraffe is well located to Union Square and Soho.  The rooms and bathrooms are large by NYC standards.  But| the best kept ""secret"" is the complimentary breakfast and happy hour with the most pleasant staff.  ",
1,Always perfect,This was my wife's and my fourth time staying at the Giraffe and as usual it was nothing but a pure pleasure:  the staff are attentive and polite| the room was beautiful and tasteful| we love the evening wine and cheese| and the hotel itself is elegant without being severe. It's completely warm and inviting.  Thanks as always.,
1,Amazing Place,I will never stay anyplace else in NYC!!! This is out second time staying at hotel giraffe and it is simply perfect. The staff is so friendly and its close to everything. There is a great bar / restaurant across the street and the subway station is a very short walk.,
155,Breakfast| Wine and Cheese served with a smile!,Just had a super stay at the Hotel Giraffe. Centrally located| clean| charming| with great lobby service and food. Breakfast is continental but has friendly| gracious servers bringing you coffee| espresso| latte| tea| or cappuccino. Hard boiled eggs| fresh pastries| fresh cut up fruit| cereals| hot oatmeal| juices| lemon water| yogurt. Midday snacks include water and all the hot drinks plus cookies. In the evening you can lounge around their baby grand and drink wine and nibble on cheese| crackers and crudités. Although we ate out at restaurants| the hotel lobby was by far my favorite place to relax and catch a quick bite.,
1,Great hotel,Liked everything about this place: room size| room style| nice bathroom| friendliness of the staff| amenities like free wine/cheese & continental breakfast| location in the city is great - just a block from Lexington Ave & Little India. I'd definitely stay there again.,
6,favorite New York hotel,Besides that the property itself is perfectly located| clean| modern| and well appointed| the staff is what makes it such a special place to stay.  They are all kind| friendly| helpful and make you feel like you are the most important guest they have.  When I have been there alone| I feel very safe and almost as if they are watching out for me.,
1,Great stay,Front desk| morning breakfast server| afternoon tea folks and the evening wine server all extremely nice and welcoming. We loved our stay at Hotel Giraffe! Perfect location and fantastic local gym. The rooms are cozy but very comfortable. ,
1,Perfect,I booked this hotel for my parents who were in NY first time. I wanted for them a place with very comfortable| friendly environment and great service. This was a perfect choice! Their room was with a nice balcony. They loved it.,
1,The perfect NYC Staycation Ladies Night!,I am originally from New York| and one of my favorite things to do is to break up my normal hustle and bustle with a perfectly planned| fun and exciting staycation in new york city.    From the moment I walked in the door the staff all had a very approachable and cheerful demeanor. I felt like they were happy to see me.  That always makes things more comfortable for me when I check in at any hotel.  My room was ready and it was a beautiful| cozy room with double beds and a balcony.  I really loved the nyc view and the warm tones of the decor.    The whole stay was pleasant| I loved the Rooftop garden for some fresh air| I can't wait to return when the spring comes.  Complimentary breakfast in the lobby in the morning and wine and cheese in the evening was just the perfect touch…,
19,Perfect for our family of four!,"We stayed here with our grown children for three nights. Had a hard time finding a room in NYC w/ two queen beds - we range in height from 5'8"" to 6'4"" so ""full"" beds don't work and we didn't want to spend the $$ getting two rooms because we knew we wouldn't be spending much time in the room. Everything about this hotel was wonderful! We arrived on Thursday evening to a happy hour with free wine| champagne| and with much better snacks (brie cheese!) than you usually find in a hotel happy hour. The lobby was lively with guests and a piano player. Our room was spacious enough for the four of us and surprisingly had enough storage for everyone to unpack (of course the kids didn't) and plug in phones| computers| etc. We were on the side street (26th?) side of the hotel and although…",
1,Business Trip,The hotel was very beautiful and the staff was extremely helpful and courteous. My only complaint was that we were not aware of a 7 day cancellation and our trip was cut short before arriving. So unfortunately the manager said that there was nothing that they could do and we were forced to pay a penalty.,
603,Well Staffed property convenient to midtown and sights,Spent a couple of days at Hotel Giraffe on a business trip this past week. Generous sized rooms were accompanied by a very helpful and courteous staff. Though I found myself on a lower floor then I would usually find comfortable from a noise level the space was reasonably quiet and very clean. I would definitely recommend to travelers of most all interests.,
90,lovely hotel,this is the sort of hotel where you feel perfectly at home. not because you are in a massive suite| although even the smallest rooms were perfectly comfortable for us| but because the staff make you feel so welcome and everything we wanted was on hand and available and included| form restaurant recommendations and reservations to endless prosecco. thank you everyone.,
1,Comfy| Cozy,Super friendly and helpful staff. Very nice| comfortable room. 24-hour refreshments in lobby. Great to be able to get coffee at 4AM before packing and leaving for early flight. Lobby is a cool place to hang out. Best all around place I've stayed in NYC. Will come again and check their other hotels as well.,
7,Great Location| Great Value,Just spent 5 days at this low key| high service| medium sized hotel. It is well located midway between Downtown and Up Town on Park and 26th. A lot of great restaurants and bars. The staff is very friendly always with your comfort in mind. We especially appreciated the complimentary morning breakfast and afternoon cheese and wine not to mention the free bottled water in each room. The balcony rooms are very nice with very comfortable beds. We asked for one of our rooms to be Hypoalergenic and it was perfect and ready for us when we arrived. Of course there is a great deal of street noise but if you keep your balcony doors closed it all goes away. The thermostat in the room worked very well for both cool and warm. The one small draw back we found was the fishbowl effect of having…,
532,Met all our expectations,Once again I'm very grateful for the TA reviews as this place was every bit as impressive as the reviews suggest. We had a terrific five night stay and the kids loved it.  We stayed in a King Suite which was fine for the three of us - myself| my 16 year old and my 14 year old.  Positives  The suite was beautifully furnished and big enough for the three of us.  Complimentary breakfast served in reception was perfect for us. Bagels| pastries| fresh fruit| cereals| toast| coffee and juices.  The complimentary wine and cheese between 5pm and 8pm each night was also terrific. Nuts| nibbles| pastries and biscuits provided so the kids were happy.  Fruit| biscuits and pastries available free all night. Coffee machine also available at all hours.  Complimentary bottles of water on…,
1,Fantastic NY Hotel,Great staff| good location| good room rate| good breakfast and nice wine-and-cheese in the afternoons. Our room was spacious and well laid out. I will definitely stay here again. We come often to New York and this is by far the best hotel yet!,
33,Fantastic NYC hotel!,My wife and I stayed in a king suite and were extremely happy with the room. There's a sitting room with a sofa and TV| a hallway with closets (including a safe and iron/ironing board) and refrigerator. The bathroom was clean and modern| although a little on the small side. The bedroom was roomy and the bed was very comfortable. I found all aspects of the room to be well maintained. They offer free wi-fi| free wine and cheese in the evening| and free breakfast. There's also a restaurant/bar in the basement which we tried one night and liked very much. Valet parking is $45/night. The nearest garage is on 27th between Lex and 3rd. I stuck with the valet service because it was raining and didn't feel like walking from the garage.  The subway (6 and R/W) are a short walk away|…,
1,My Favorite NYC Hotel!,My husband and I have traveled between Wash DC and NYC many many times over the years for both business and pleasure.  During that time| I was always hoping to find a hotel where I would return again;  never found it until the Hotel Giraffe.  The room was lovely and well laid out| the location was excellent (an easy walk to Eataly and Grand Central!) and the staff was uncommonly friendly and helpful.  The morning breakfast (complementary) was outstanding and the evening wine and cheese was equally good.  Plus| throughout the day| coffee| cookies and fruit awaited.  I could go on and on...we will definitely return here and will recommend it to all who ask.  ,
8,Somehow exceeded already high expectations,From check-in to check-out| this hotel was simply superb. The front desk went above and beyond to switch our rooms around so we could be on the same floor as our family. The delightful hostess for the morning and evening food service (I think her name was Gabriela?) was fantastic-- attentive| pleasant| and made us all feel so welcome. Honestly| I felt like I was staying in someone's gorgeous| immaculate home rather than a hotel. It felt cozy| warm| and very comfortable. While this was a splurge for us budget-wise| it may be one we have to make when we visit NYC because I cannot imagine staying anywhere else. We have also stayed at The Library Hotel and had an equally fantastic stay. This company clearly knows how to take care of their guests. Highly recommend. ,
1,King Suite,The King Suite is well designed and spacious  ( by New York City standards) It was a quiet lovely oasis in a busy city.We  really enjoyed lolling in the lobby with the  fresh complimentary breakfast. .  One day we had a 4 AM start to our day  so it was great to get a cafe latte to go|( as good as Starbucks) because coffee|tea| fruit and cookies are available 24 hrs. Staff was always  really helpful.,
57,Perfect New York City Hotel,"Great boutique hotel| in a great location.  Especially liked the breakfast which had a good selection| great service and yummy.  The ""happy hour"" was also wonderful| again great service and generous servings of wine and cheese and nibbles.  Particular mention also to the staff who helped find the ""uber"" car and get our suitcases across the busy intersection when we left on a dark and cold evening.  Very helpful|  excellent service.  Would definitely stay again.",
42,Perfect place to stay in middle of NYC,Hotel Giraffe is on Park Ave and 26th St| near 2 subway stops and plenty of restaurants.  We had 2 comfortable Queen beds| great shower| and very welcoming staff.  Breakfast was included and better than most hotel breakfasts - fresh fruit| cappuccino| scones| etc.  The cozy lobby was open for coffee drinks and cookies when you got back to the hotel late.  Didn't make it to the free wine and cheese hour but it was packed with guests.  Make reservations for nearby restaurants because we had trouble getting in even after 8pm for dinner - Upland| The Little Beet.  Eataly is nearby.  Will definitely stay here again!,
1,Honeymoon of My Dreams,My husband and I live in Queens| NY and for our honeymoon we decided to stay in Manhattan.  We found the Hotel Giraffe recommended as a romantic hotel| and it did not disappoint.  The rooms were gorgeous| and so well taken care of throughout the day.  In the evening our blinds were always closed and instrumental music was playing as we entered the room.  There is a wine and cheese reception every evening| and it is such a lovely little treat.  We felt so welcome| and a little spoiled.  I would definitely want to visit again for anniversaries.  Thank you for making my honeymoon so memorable!  ,
39,Excellent hotel,Stayed at Hotel Giraffe for 6 nights had an amazing time! Hotel is midway between world trade centre and Times Square so a quieter location but just around the corner from Maddison Square Gardens and a short walk to the Rockafeller. It was my husbands 50th birthday celebration so the hotel had Prosecco and chocolate coated strawberries ready when we arrived. Continental breakfast served each morning which is unusual for a hotel in NYC to offer an inclusive breakfast and each evening cheese and wine is served in the lobby between 5pm and 8pm| a great touch! This is also included in the price. The hotel doesn't have a coffee facility in the room but one is available if you ask and free coffee/tea is available in the lobby 24/7! Excellent staff who couldn't do enough to help! We…,
216,Absolutely LOVED this hotel.,Loved the size (smaller) Location (Park and 26th) Decor (elegant/relaxed/lots of wood and orchids) Staff (they smile!  they talk!  they look you in the eye!!) Rooms (LARGE with a balcony!!) Price ( including taxes $315 for a night),
10,Really nice hotel in a great location,Hotel was wonderful with a great staff and perfect location in Flatiron district . Rooms were clean well appointed and hotel served great buffet breakfast and wine and cheese nightly. A nice touch and very appreciated .. Well priced for a NY hotel. Would defiantly come back next time in NYC. ,
5,Enjoy !!!,Greeted by a pleasant staff. Nice sized rooms. Lobby was enjoyable to relax or play a game of cards. Enjoyed coffee| cappuccino and expresso anytime of day. Nice breakfast and wine and cheese each evening. GREAT STAY !,
4,Winter stay at the Giraffe,The Giraffe team were so nice and accommodating and generous!  We arrived at 10am hoping for early check in. While we were waiting for our room to become available| we were already invited to indulge in their complimentary breakfast even if we had not stayed the night yet !  In addition| Hotel Giraffe was able to fulfill our request for early check in.   We stayed in a King Suite without a balcony on the 10th floor. There is a king suite with a balcony too for a higher rate. Our room was very clean| pleasant smelling| and bathroom very clean (which is a must on my list). Sofa bed/living room area was dark but that can't be helped because of its location in the building. However| the main bedroom was nice and bright. In the evenings| our beds were turned down| we were left…,
558,Superb,We arrived late afternoon and checked in straight away. Our room was on the 8th floor| 804. We had a king bed which was one of the best bed's we have ever slept in. It was our Anniversary on our trip and the hotel had left a bottle of prosecco with glasses out for us which was a lovely touch. The room was spacious and we felt so comfortable in it. We found our shower leaked over the floor unless you put the shower curtain right to the wall. I also thought the bathroom was slightly small but that was just me. The breakfast was fantastic. Every morning we had cereal/ porridge| fresh fruit and pastries. You can have orange juice and the ladies also make hot drinks for you at breakfast. The cheese and wine evenings were a lovely touch. We found the wine tasted quite cheap but I…,
18,Where Everyone Knows Your Name,Hotel Giraffe is the hidden gem that everyone seeks to find. The key word is value. Not only do you receive a lovely immaculate room| a complimentary continental breakfast| wine and cheese in the afternoon but you also receive personal friendly service which is hard to find these days. We have stayed there before| both times in one of their lovely suites (we had at least 6 windows and a floor to ceiling door that opened onto Park Avenue South). This time everyone greeted us by name and we were made to feel as if we were coming back to a family and not just a hotel. You are near Madison Square Park and conveniently located near two subway stations which is the only way to get around NY. Kudos to the front desk staff| the lovely girls who serve breakfast and wine and to Ray. …,
1,NYC splurge!,I travel to NYC quite often for work but chose to splurge at the Hotel Giraffe during a personal trip.  At check in it came out that I was there with my BFF and my sister for my birthday.  With that information they managed to have a bottle of bubbly and nice birthday wishes waiting for me in the room.  The room was a double queen with balcony and it was amazing!  Larger than most double queens I've stayed in and zero street noise. I truly can't say enough about the property| the location| or the staff.  The nightly reception - which included scrumptious wine and appetizers - was so fun!  And the staff could not have been any nicer.  So happy I decided to splurge and will absolutely choose this hotel again.,
1,A Little Extra,This was the first time that I stayed at Hotel Giraffe.  It is a lovely hotel in a great location with wonderful amenities.  Rooms were extremely comfortable and roomy.  The continental breakfast with fresh croissants| the complimentary wine and cheese complete with a piano player made the stay a little extra special and comfortable.  It was nice to come back after a long day and to be able to sit in lobby with coffee and a cookie.  The staff was excellent and obviously wanted you to enjoy your stay.  Definitely would stay here again.,
2,We discovered a NYC gem!,The Hotel Giraffe exceeded our expectations!  From the lobby lounge areas| the friendly staff| well appointed rooms| wine and cheese evening welcome| and delicious breakfast options| we would definitely return when needing a accommodations in lower Manhattan.  The adjoining Italian restaurant Bread and Tulip was a delightful discovery-atmosphere| great food selections.,
1,Steve & Bonnie,When we come to the City| this is where we stay. The location is perfect| the ambience is warm and cozy| the staff is exceptional and consistent| and the lounge is welcoming.  Not too large and not too small. It's just the right size and situated convenient to everything.  ,
9,Best Hotel!,We were very pleased with our stay at the Hotel Giraffe. We checked in later than expected and the front desk gave us a bottle of wine because we missed the wine & cheese reception for that day. Everyone was always so accommodating and nice. The Hotel was styled beautifully and was very clean. The location is great. 0nly a few blocks from a subway and the Madison Square park is right there. Our room was well appointed and we had a beautiful balcony. We will definitely be back!,
283,As usual....fabulous,From reservation handling| check-in| room| breakfast| check-out and the friendly| great door man....perfect. This is the only hotel I will consider when in Manhattan. I've stayed a dozens of NYC hotels| and for the dollar| this is the place.,
1,Manager and Ron Rizza,I can't begin to express how wonderful our stay at the Hotel Giraffe was. From the call to book speaking with your employee Ron Rizza to the wonderful  front desk| doorman and especially the girl who was behind the bar at breakfast and wine and cheese.  The rooms far exceeded our expectations. This was our first trip to the Hotel Giraffe but it won't be our last.  Thank you for a wonderful stay.,
24,Superior service boutique hotel in NYC,Excellent boutique hotel in New York! Great location at 26th and Park Ave S. Very nice rooms...super comfortable beds. Bathrooms are updated and lovely. But better than anything is the service! Lobby is a small but comfortable place where continental breakfast is served in the mornings. You can get coffee/espresso/latte/cappuccino all day long from their awesome coffee machine in the lobby bar...you can also get any kind of tea all day long. Price to stay here in January was extremely reasonable| too! Nothing makes me crazier than staying in a nice hotel and the only way to get coffee or tea is via room service....not the case here...you have access to it all day and night! Staff was best I've come across in NYC.,
1,Fabulous,The location is fantastic| the place itself is great but the absolutely best thing is the wonderful staff and how they really care for their guest.   They kindly replied to all my emails to prepare my stay and help me to arrange the picking up at the airport.    Very nice to have the wine&cheese included and a warm drink at anytime.  My top favorite one!,
7,Great place to stay in NYC!,Not your typical tourist hotel.  Great location.  Friendly and accommodating staff.  Room was spacious| modern| and clean.  Great continental breakfast included.  It is a quiet neighborhood| but not remote.  Will definitely stay there again!,
1,Couples getaway in NY,We just got home from our trip and the giraffe was our favourite of the hotels we stayed in while on our trip to America. Beautiful boutique hotel| we stayed in a room with a balcony which competed our New York stay| we watched the snow fall from our luxurious and cosy room. ,
5,What a gem! ,Our family of 4 stayed for 11 nights at the the hotel over Christmas as part of a trip of a lifetime from Australia.  We chose to stay at Hotel Giraffe after reading the awesome recommendations here on Trip advisor. So pleased we did. The hotel exceeded our expectations!  It's location on Park Avenue is perfect as it is either a short walk or a subway ride to wherever you may need to go without being too close to the hectic atmosphere of Times Square. The rooms are very large and the beds are probably the most comfortable I have ever slept in.  The breakfast each day and evening reception are a wonderful bonus.  The friendly staff enhanced our overall experience. Can't  wait to return!,
5,Lovely hotel,We only stayed for one night with our two kids ages 9 and 12 yrs| but would love to come back soon. The rooms are large for being NYC and the beds very comfortable. Clean and fresh and a lot of nice details such as a meny of additional props to the room if desired  (sleeping masks| music for sleeping| pillows with special foam etc) as well as complimentary wine and cheese between 5-7 pm.,
7,Home from home!,Coming from Africa| what initially drew me to this hotel was the name| and it really felt like home!  The rooms all had balconies | and the staff were amazing. One of the receptionists even spent time trying to track down a friend whose phone number we had lost!! And after having previously stayed at the heart of Times Square| which is so busy| we loved the location of this hotel. We will definitely stay again.,
84,Stunning Hotel,The Giraffe has it all -- lovely decor| well appointed rooms| great staff| live jazz and a proper (free) nightly drinks reception.  The only downside is that it can come at quite a cost depending on when you book.,
4,Best boutique hotel in NYC,I have stayed at many boutique hotels in NYC and bar none this one is my favourite.  The rooms are large for New York standard and the rooms have a balcony which is so very rare for NYC hotels.  Hotel Giraffe is located in a great area and walking distance or subway to everything.  Plus they have free drinks and appetizers from 5-8pm.  Everyone who works there is so kind and helpful.  This is my new favourite and only hotel I will be staying at in NYC from now on.,
1,What service should be,From the helpful reception to the hard working attentive staff this place is a gem in the Big Apple. Evening wine and biscuits is superb. I cant speak highly enough about this hotel. Great room great location ,
29,Beautiful hotel we'll be back,This is a wonderful hotel with large rooms and provides exceptional service. The staff are fantastic and the continental breakfast| happy hour drinks and pastries during the day are a lovely touch. Rooms are well appointed and serviced twice a day. The hotel is not cheap but is well worth the extra money for excellent service and space in New York.,
1,Great hotel,Loved our stay at the Hotel Giraffe| staff were great and very helpful. We would stay there again any time. We really enjoyed the wine and cheese at night and the breakfast spread was all we needed for a big day out in the city.,
1,Great place to stay with young kids,We stayed at the Giraffe hotel the week before Christmas with our 3 year old son. I had stayed there before for business so I knew how great it was.  They completely exceeded our expectations.  They provided everything we requested (bedding| pillows| food| milk etc.). The neighbourhood is very kid friendly. I highly recommend the Giraffe hotel for anyone traveling with kids.,
1,Cosy and efficient hotel,Very welcoming staff and very efficient whatever issue or question you have  Confortable and efficient bled and bathroom. Breakfast and evening cheese and wine break are just perfect. Hotel well located with good access to all touristic areas through subways and in a quiet and safe neighborhood. ,
17,A Romantic New Year's Eve,Hotel Giraffe is a treasure in our city.  From the moment my wife and I walked in| we were warmly greeted and were made to feel at home. We were only staying for the night| but made a point to enjoy a snack and coffee before going out to dinner in the lobby cafe.  We enjoyed the vibe.  We also got fantastic help getting a cab from the staff.  A staff member flagged down a cab for us| and we really appreciated the effort.  In addition| the room was neat| super clean and a pleasure to relax in overnight. The continental breakfast was top notch in the lobby area.  We look forward to stopping back soon.   ,
118,Excellent find,My wife and I were looking for a last minute hotel in NYC to celebrate my birthday. We only chose this hotel because it is close to my sister in-laws apartment but we will be back because of how nice the place is.  We checked in around 6pm and found that they have a wine and cheese event every night in the lobby for guests. Although we didn't have time to stop by| it looked very nice. They also have complimentary continental breakfast in the morning which is a nice perk. The room itself was great. It had plenty of space and the bed was comfortable.  I used to stay at the Trump Soho when we were in NYC overnight but that is no longer an option because of the name on the building. The Hotel Giraffe is my new go-to spot in NYC. The staff was great| the room was great| and the…,
33,Lovely!,What a pleasant place - great service| nice snacks and breakfast| lovely room and amenities!  We just lost access to our usual apartment to borrow in the Upper West Side. Now we have a new NYC home away from home! ,
165,Exceptional stay over New Years,Stayed at the fantastic Hotel Giraffe for a few days over the New Years period. Booked some months back due to the peak time. Everything from email booking to getting a taxi to JFK at the end our stay was effortless. The staff were professional and helpful. The 2QB room had extremely comfortable beds - enjoyed a completely peaceful sleep. Clean and good sized bathroom| with a combined shower/bathtub. The brunch is the morning gets your day started fantastically well with a good mix of cereals| pastries| bagels| fruit salad| yoghurt| teas & coffees.  Great location with subways| cafes and restaurants nearby. Uber finds the hotel with ease. Taxis readily available. Highly recommend staying here!,
24,A gem of a hotel,I love this hotel. The understated elegant style| the fabulously friendly and efficient staff| the location..  My autistic teenage son was made to feel welcome.. I had a surprise bottle of fizz in the room to celebrate my birthday. The complementary breakfast and early evening drinks and nibbles were fantastic. The bed was blissfully comfortable and the room large by NYC standards. I have stayed at a number of hotels in new York and this is my favourite..And we will be back!! ,
207,generally excellent,This was generally a very good experience.  The room was clean and comfortable| especially the bed which was terrific; the staff were friendly and helpful; the location was good - very near a subway and a supermarket/pharmacy and many attractions; the price was expensive but not untypical of Manhattan.    What was exceptional was the breakfast and evening when they had created a warm space like being in a friend's a front living room where you could get complimentary cheese| wine and piano playing in the evening and newspapers and breakfast in the morning - a very nice touch that was a bit unusual.  The only thing that brought it short of 5 stars for me was that I could hear quite loudly the sound of water in the pipes whenever my neighbour turned on their taps; also the sound…,
79,Amazing Christmas stay in new York at the Hotel Giraffe,We had a wonderful family Christmas in New York with the family| that we really made by the fantastic welcome and ongoing customer service that we received from the team at the hotel.  A special call out must go to Chris| who managed to secure a fantastic table at Wolfgang Steakhouse on one night and then the next night found us a unique carol service to attend in Gramercy Park ( Very rarely open to the general public).     The breakfasts set us up well for each day and then we look forward to the Cheese and wine on a couple of evenings. The location of the hotel and the quality of the service make this a great boutique hotel to stay at in the heart of Manhatten.,
60,A wonderful hotel which we will definitely return to!,We just spent a week at Hotel Giraffe over Christmas.  They answered all of questions promptly before we arrived and were given a room on the 11th floor.  It was clean and had everything we could possibly need.  The complimentary breakfast| constant coffee and snack availability and evening cheese and wine were an excellent addition to our stay.  The staff were friendly but not intrusive and I can recommend having the housekeeping in the evening - chocolates| piano music and a turned down bed! Gabby| who worked there| was particularly welcoming and very good with our son!  She remembered our wine preferences and gave us excellent service!,
38,Great hotel,Good size rooms. Has all the amenities. Complimentary wi-fi| continental breakfast and evening drinks. Free use of nearby major gym chain much better than a small room with a bike and rowing machine. Staff friendly and helpful. Only criticism is that the sofa bed quality is really poor and lets down what is a great hotel.,
262,Extremely nice ,This is by far the best hotel I stayed in this country. Extremely good service. Decent size of the bedroom. Extremely well services at the reception upon arrival.   Room service was expensive but it's worth of it if you don't want to get out. ,
4,Great hotel| great location,Just returned from Christmas in New York and staying at this lovely relaxed hotel was perfect. It is a great location for the subway and a little distance from the noise and bustle of uptown but with enough bars and restaurants when you don't want to venture too far.  The hotel itself is great with large rooms| we had a suite so the sofa| in the living room pulled out into a bed for the children.  The roof top garden didn't have great views but for smokers is a godsend.  The lack of bar is the only thing that lets the hotel down but they did have free wine and prosecco every evening between 5 & 8 in the lobby which is a lovely place to chill.  Upland| the bar opposite is fab and the restaurant there looked good too but our best find was the Hillstone| a restaurant on the next…,
5,Lovely| luxury boutique hotel,We spent a few days in December 2016 at this lovely hotel.  The accommodations| the location and especially the beautiful lobby where wine and cheese receptions and complimentary continental breakfasts are served were outstanding.  The reception and breakfast staff were delightful.  For a luxury stay at a reasonable NYC price| I would highly recommend the Hotel Giraffe.  There is valet parking available for a fair price. Also| ask the front desk for the origins of its quirky name!,
2,Christmas in NY,What a beautiful building. Awesome staff. So welcoming. We had a great time| can't wait to go back. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. The wine & cheese at night is a wonderful touch| breakfast was good too!,
1,Christmas in New York,We booked two rooms at Hotel Giraffe for an adult family Christmas Day gathering in Manhattan.  My husband and I prefer staying at Library Hotel Collection properties which provide guests personal service.  This was our first stay at Hotel Giraffe. Prior to arrival| Gaby (hotel front desk) made our dinner reservations within walking distance. Upon check-in| we were greeted professionally and warmly by Manny.  Our spacious balcony king room was immaculate as was our family member's Queen room on the same floor.  Grand Lobby was tastefully and festively decorated for the holiday.  Daily wine and cheese offers guests quiet hospitality before dinner.  Continental breakfast is beyond ample. Our hotel room bed linens were pristine| bathroom toiletries top shelf.  Block out window…,
7,Most comfortable stay we've had in Manhattan,I've been to Manhattan a number of times and this is easily the most comfortable stay I've had for 3 adults and a 9 month old baby. Compared to the Hilton Midtown| it is much cleaner| more modern| and more friendly. I loved not being so close to the buzz of midtown. Compared to the Martha Washington| the room size was way bigger (though we did opt for the suite) but it was nice having a doorman and a more helpful front desk.  The complementary breakfast was amazing for my daughter with fruits| oatmeal| toast| bagels| coffee and yogurt! Perfect way to start the ay.  The complementary wine and cheese 530-8pm included live piano and white| red| or prosecco. A great way to start an evening!  The doorman was always so helpful and friendly.  The room itself was fantastic. Plugs were…,
32,Plus and Minuses,I had reserved a room at the hotel with high hopes/expectations so perhaps this explained the slight disappointment at the overall experience. There are huge pluses that should be acknowledged. It is true what others say about the great continental breakfast on offer in the mornings and the choices of wines and cheese in the evening. The quality of the breakfast and evening drinks is high. I've stayed at other NYC hotels that offer evening drinks but I the options at Hotel Giraffe impressive. They also have coffee| tea and biscuits throughout the day in the hotel lobby. This is great when you pop back into the hotel for a quick rest between shopping trips.   The hotel room is small but this is standard for all NYC hotels. I had the basic room with queen bed. It was adequate for…,
1,Short but beautiful days,- only negative item: bathroom had no heating unit + very friendly and helpful stuff + coffee and tea with some goodies for free at any time + comfortable lobby + comfortable room with very good king size bed (very well slept),
1,Fabulous stay!, Great complimentary breakfasts. Friendly and helpful staff. Nice cheese and wine reception presided over by the lovely 'Gabriella' who was a credit to the hotel. Clean and well equipped room. Hotel situated in great location for exploring Manhattan. ,
15,Exceptional,Unquestionably one of the best and most imprssive hotels I have stayed at . The staff are first class and nothing is too much trouble . Position is great for all the sights . Had a suite and it was very spacious and well priced . Thank you to all the staff for a memorable 4 night stay . Would not stay anywhere else in New York,
7,Friendly hotel with warm room.,Great hotel. Small. People really friendly and helpful. Not in the area where I usually stay. I took walks and found things to do in that neighborhood. I would stay there again. Room was comfortable and warm. Shower was clogged and I am sure they would have come to fix it| but I was only there 1 night. Restaurant was really good.,
4,Enjoyed,I really really enjoyed a lot their with my girl friend| nice room quality and then nice support for customers| nice view and many many many things to say| but really really i enjoyed a lot and if i get chance i will go again.,
116,New NYC Favorite,We like to come up to the city about every six months. Someone is always having a birthday or we have an anniversary to celebrate. Normally we stay up by the park but this visit my husband booked Hotel Giraffe.  We were seeing Chris Botti in Greenwich and a few shows. We also wanted to walk the Brooklyn Bridge and have pizza in Brooklyn. The hotel turned out to be perfect. We were able to walk to everything when we wanted or hop on the train with a station just a block up. The staff could not but have been friendlier. They made reservations at Market Table for me and we were even greeted with a bottle of wine and chocolates.  The room was spacious and had everything we needed.  If we forgot anything or even needed a memory foam pillow it was available.  Perfect stay for us. We…,
3,Surpassed My Expectations...,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Hotel Giraffe. My room was better than what was pictured online| the staff was amazing and evening turndown service was a pleasant surprise.  I couldn't have asked for better than what was provided as the staff was so accommodating. The location was great for those who have multiple destinations. We were within walking distance or a short cab drive away from many destinations - not to mention the subway is within a block away. ,
124,Loved it.,Staff is always eager and willing to help. Not one bad experience. The concierge (Almira) contacted me weeks prior to arrival to cheerfully help me with travel ideas| bookings| transport| etc. Comfortable bed| quiet room| convenient location| ample breakfast and happy hour included in the room rate -- which is a reasonable price considering what you receive. This is not the norm in Manhattan in my experience. In fact| we had stayed at the NoMad the day before we moved to the Giraffe. What a difference - same room rate| major street noise in our very small dark room (which needed updating) and no breakfast included. The Giraffe may not be considered as posh as the NoMad| but I would stay at the Hotel Giraffe over the NoMad any day. Highly recommend it.,
17,Feeling like at home,Staying at the Giraffe| is like being at home. The staff is very friendly| the rooms are spacious and quiet. The hotel serves cheese and wine between 5-8pm and breakfast in the hotel lobby-all included in the room rate. The location is great| in walking distance from Penn station| Union Sqare and the Empire. Good restaurants everywhere in the neighborhood.,
116,An enjoyable stay,We have previously had excellent experiences with the Library Hotels brand and Hotel Giraffe met our high expectations. We had the Classic Suite which was delightful - comfortable| spacious| elegant and well equipped. It had everything we needed. Although we were on the second floor| we did not hear any noise from the street. The staff were not overly welcoming but they were helpful and professional. Breakfast had only a limited selection of food including fruit| yoghurt| pastries and bagels. However it was sufficient and the toasted bagels were delicious! The lobby area where breakfast is served is lovely. There are hot beverages| fruit and cookies available to guests in this area all day| which is a nice touch and it was great to be able to get a cup of tea after returning…,
4,Amazing!!,The staff at this precious boutique hotel are second to none!! Always smiling and extremely helpful! A special hats off to JR and Chris who made our daughter feel like she was the queen of NYC!! The limo was an awesome upgrade! Thank you!!!,
1,Great stay in NYC,We stayed at Hotel Giraffe during December of 2016. It was great. The continental breakfast was quick| convenient and tasty. The hotel is centrally located to many attractions. The staff was friendly and helpful,
3,Hotel Giraffe Review,We have been wanting to stay at this hotel for a number of years now and we were not let down.  The hotel is clean| cozy| comfortable and in a great location.  They breakfast buffet and wine and cheese at the end of the day was a nice touch.  Our Room was great.  We got one of the suites and the size and furnishings were very good.  The entire staff was professional| courteous and helpful.  ,
2,Fabulous hotel!,This was our second stay at the Hotel Giraffe for a girls weekend getaway and we loved it even more this time around! The service was exceptional and the staff went out of their way to make us feel at home. Lovely hotel and great location...Thank you| thank you!! ,
1,Friendly| cosy| would definitely stay here next time,This was an excellent well located hotel. I really enjoyed the relatively spacious room . The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful . The hotel is well located close to the 6 subway and within walking distance of the theatre district.,
3,Hotel Giraffe,Wonderful hotel with great staff. They had an awesome breakfast. There was also wine and cheese happy hours. Loved the auto window shade and comfy beds.Great location! Close to subway. Within walking distance to some restaurants. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. ,
5,Hotel Giraffe,This is such a great hotel. Perfect location| great staff| wonderful free breakfast and afternoon wine and munchies. We always try to stay here when we are in the city. It is also quiet so sleeping is wonderful. ,
691,Pretty little boutique hotel| noisy,Stayed here recently on a business trip.  This hotel does not have room service but arranged to have breakfast delivered for a local diner (sent me up a menu| took my order| placed the order for me| put it on my bill| and brought it up to me) which I thought was an extremely nice service.  (They have a nice breakfast buffet although a bit heavy on the carbs| but during business trips I try to conserve time by getting myself ready while alternatively taking bites of breakfast.)  Nice complimentary wine and cheese reception in the evenings.  I was on the 7th floor in a suite| with the bedroom area facing 26th St.  It was quite noisy| including a 3am very loud garbage collection literally right across from my window.  The living room of the suite faced inward| into a small…,
57,Fantastic stay at Hotel Giraffe!!!,We spent a long weekend at Hotel Giraffe Dec 9-12.  I booked here based on the wonderful reviews on TA and they are absolutely warranted!  It is a boutique hotel located in a great location (26th and Park) in the Flatiron/Grammercy Park district.  There are numerous wonderful restaurants close by (Grammercy Tavern| ABC Kitchen| Eataly| original Shake Shack) and it is convenient to most sites in Manhattan.  The green 6 line metro stop is only 2 blocks away (28th St).  We stayed in a king suite| which was very generous in space for a NYC hotel.  The bed was plush.  The bathroom was relatively small but just fine for our needs with excellent shower water pressure.  The staff were attentive and helpful| especially Gabriella who we saw at the wine/prosecco/cheese reception every…,
236,Nice hotel with good service,We stayed here for the weekend. Check in and check out were very efficient| with valid parking ($45 a day| good price). Breakfast is simple but better than most other hotels (if they have breakfast at all). the afternoon wine and cheese is a nice gesture. We did not use it but it looked good. Just annoying that some guest come down| take the wine and cheese and disappear to their rooms..... treating it like a buffet. The rooms are relatively big| clean with classic interior.  A hotel we will go back to.,
2,relaxed luxury!,Hotel Giraffe is a well run| well maintained property in a nice| centralized location. Turned out to be a great value for us- we booked pretty early and got a fantastic room ( thank you  Giraffe for getting upgraded without even asking!).  Even the initially booked room would have been bigger and nicer than most Manhattan hotel rooms.  Great staff|  all friendly and helpful| and nobody is stuffy. Breakfast is surprisingly good ( real NY bagels and pastries| real fruit| cappuccino| etc).  Wine and cheese evenings are also really nicely done. Close to a lot of great restaurants ( Gramercy Tavern#1| Breslin| ABC| Upland|to name a few). Short taxi/uber to get to most places| so this encourages exploration| rather than confining yourself to just Times Square.,
6,Always a pleasure staying at Hotel Giraffe!,After several times staying at Hotel Giraffe we continue to be very pleased.  The staff is welcoming and helpful and the amenities are wonderful.  The breakfast is substantial and evening wine and cheese is appreciated after a long day in NYC.  It is always very clean and comfortable as well. ,
1,wonderful refuge, We were a foursome who came into NYC to see a show and celebrate life with each other! The  staff| the environment and hospitality shown to us were as perfect as we had hoped for| when we planned our trip. The hotel is a sweet| modern| welcoming place| in a very nice location. The rooms were clean and very comfortable| and the evening reception induced relaxation and conversation. I'd go back tomorrow| and would highly recommend the hotel!  ,
1,Stay in NYC,This was my 4th stay at the Hotel Giraffe.  I absolutely love this hotel.  It is very comfortable and the staff extremely helpful.  The breakfast and wine in the evening are a nice touch.  Would highly recommend!,
5,New home away in NYC,Excellent service| nice suite and surprisingly quiet for NYC. We requested a foam topper for the mattress which enhanced an already comfy bed. Wine and cheese in the evenings; cappuccino in the mornings. Will definitely stay here again on future trips. ,
1,Weekend getaway,My wife and I had a weekend getaway with another couple and stayed at the Giraffe.  The lobby was a beautiful place to gather and have coffee| pastries| and live piano music.  Coffee and snacks were available 24 hours and that made things very handy at odd hours.  We stayed on the 11th floor and had a nice balcony view of downtown.  The room was surprisingly quite and very well kept.  I would definitely come back for another trip in the future.  BTW| the staff was very helpful and friendly| especially Jose the doorman.  Well done.,
5,Relaxing oasis,Low key| high service| elegant hotel. Nicely appointed rooms. Attentive| accommodating staff| and lovely seating area for gathering with friends. Perfect location with quick access to neighboring restaurants| clubs| Eataly| and shopping. ,
2,Hotel Giraffe is the place to stay in NYC!!,I highly recommend the Hotel Giraffe.   The rooms are very spacious.    The employees are friendly and helpful.   The complimentary breakfast is great way to start the day.   The complimentary wine and cheese reception is a nice way to begin the evening.   You will not be disappointed if you stay here!!!,
558,Terrific Suite,Worth it to upgrade to a suite. Separate living room with coach| 2 chairs| and fridge. Prices include evening happy hour with nice selection of cheeses| crackers| and choice of red| white wine or Prosecco| and in the morning| continental breakfast. Staff was very friendly. No obvious concierge. A few blocks to the subway. Very relaxing and enjoyable,
2,Great Find In The City,What a pleasant surprise to stay at Hotel Giraffe. The staff is happy and helpful| the rooms are pretty and clean and the location works for most anything you do in NY. They have a lovely morning coffee service and equally nice evening of wine and nibbles| with a smile!,
7,5th visit and we will be back!,The staff is grate. The rooms are always clean. Beds are perfect. Location is one of the best.  The only negative thing is the breakfast. They do not offer you meet and chees on your toast. Will be back!,
4,Visit with Kids,My kids loved this hotel.  It felt like a home away from home.  There was usually food in the lobby and the staff was small enough that we got to know them in just a couple of days.  The room was laid out perfect for us- a small living for the kids to sleep in and a separate bedroom for parents.  We will be back.,
30,Great location| balcony,In NYC for business. Flew in late| 10:30 PM flight landing so to the hotel around midnight. Check in was simple| easy| took 1 minutes to confirm reservation and to the room. The room is not exceptionally large- this is Manhattan after all| but comfortable classic and modern. The room has an 11 foot ceiling- so it seems bigger. And a balcony! High enough so there is no street noise when open. Not high enough to see a great vita| just one of those amenities that add greatly to the peception. The bathroom| comfortable size| not super tiny as many NYC hotels| and all of the usual amenities. Plenty of towels| (5) Location is on Park Avenue- so plenty of restaurants| nearby. Not too far from Wall Street| by taxi|not too far from Times Square or Rockefeller Center| walking. There is a…,
1,487,Didn't want to leave!,Believe all the excellent reviews! Based on TA we took a leap of faith and stayed for 11 nights over Thanksgiving. We were charmed by this fabulous boutique hotel and the incredible staff| most particularly the lovely young women at breakfast.    Our room was huge for a NY hotel and larger than our son's apartment. Having the suite made it perfect when my husband| recovering from an accident| needed an afternoon rest. The bed so comfortable with high quality linen.   The location was fantastic| near my favorite Flatiron Bldg| Madsion Square Park and convenient subway stations.Everything in the room was perfect and appreciated the bottle water replaced each day. The heater was the quietest I have ever experienced| better than my own home.   I could go on and on| but  suffice to…
88,Great place to stay,A lovely| friendly hotel. The room was very well appointed| with a comfortable armchair| soft bed and a balcony| exactly like the photograph. The bathroom was extremely well laid out| with lots of light| more mirrors than I probably wanted| good products and plenty of places to store things. A lit magnifying mirror is always a good touch for those of us who have sight problems and this one was well placed and a good size. All of these things would have meant I would give the hotel 5 stars but the extras such as free continental breakfast; happy 3 hours in the evening| with free cheese and wine| and coffee and cookies during the day add to the hotel's appeal. The hostess| Gabrielle| worked hard to make everyone feel welcome. We enjoyed our stay here very much and would definitely…,
25,Great value| location and generally very good hotel,Excellent value. We had a quadruple room and there was plenty of room. Very comfy bed. We had a balcony which we didn't use a lot (it was very cold) but was nice to have a peek outside.  Free cheese and wine in the early evening which is great in an expensive city!   Good location. 10 mins walk from Empire State and 20 mins from Central Park. 2 blocks from a subway station.   Staff very pleasant and helpful.   Great breakfast of toast| bagels| fruit| muffins| eggs. Just perfect to set you up for the day!   Free tea and coffee all day in the lobby to have in or take away. A nice touch.   Just a really good value hotel. Would definitely recommend.,
79,Great boutique hotel,A great hotel with exceptional staff dedicated to providing excellent customer service. A continental breakfast was included in my room rate| the breakfast had a good choice of items and was sufficient for me. My room has to be one of the quietest hotel rooms that I have stayed in whilst visiting New York. The room was clean| quiet and spacious. Daily cleaning and turn down service were offered every day of my stay. I will definitely stay at the Giraffe hotel and highly recommend it.,
2,Hotel Giraffe NYC,Accomodation was excellent. Cleanliness 5/5| comfort 5/5.  We were upgraded to a superior room. Service was also excellent and all the staff were very helpful. The hotel was in a good location| within easy walking distance of the Empire State Building| Times square and several subway stations.,
3,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,Rooms were great. We had one that had a terrace. I loved having the free breakfast in the hotel each morning. There is also an Italian restaurant in the hotel. All the extras were great (i.e. cookies| beverages| and fruit during the day). Great location for several top restaurants. Service and staff was wonderful. You can go wrong booking this hotel.,
2,Charming boutique hotel,The service at the front desk and door/bellman was very good.  Really| every staff person I encountered| even the room attendants| seemed to be very happy| helpful| and resonated sincere willingness to help and pride in their job.  Very refreshing!      My guest room was well-apointed| and overlooked Park Avenue with a small balcony.  The bed and pillows were very comfortable.   5pm daily wine and cheese was a treat in the welcoming lobby| accented with live piano music.   Note:  Some of the upholstered furniture| such as chairs in lobby and guest room were stained.  Time for a cosmetic sprucing up| I believe.,
45,Another great from the Library Collection,Hotel Giraffe was warm and welcoming for the Thanksgiving holiday!  Wonderful people at the front desk and especially at the breakfast and happy hour!  Nice room with a Juliet balcony!  The breakfast was delicious and the evening reception delightful!!,
2,Brilliant Hotel,Great location. Breakfast was amazing as was the complimentary cheese and wine each night| and the waitresses were always so nice and helpful. Great hotel would definitely recommend and hopefully be back soon!,
1,Giraffe revisited,A home away from home! This was my second stay at hotel Giraffe and it was just as I remembered. Friendly staff| high service level| spacious and clean rooms and the breakfast and wine & cheese served in the lobby are such extra bonuses. An extra thank you to the very friendly and service minded hostess in the lobby who made everyone feel so at home.,
5,Hotel Giraffe,Really nice| small boutique hotel.  Room very comfortable; staff excellent.  Really liked the continental breakfast in the morning| and the evening wine| hors doervres and music.  Very welcoming place!  Highly recommend,
11,Saturday night in the City,Nice room.  Excelllent Wine and Cheese Happy 3 Hours with a fantastic hostess. Very good breakfast with many coffee beverages and excellent service. Great location.  Only negative was it took two staff members to figure out how to use TV remote.,
2,My stay at Hotel Giraffe,I very much loved this hotel.  The included breakfast and cocktail hour were lovely| with a broad offering| and very nice personnel.  My hotel was directly across the hall from the elevators| but I didn't hear anything.  And the location was terrific!,
617,Excellent Hotel in Great Location,"We usually stay in a ""sister"" hotel but thought we would have a change of location with similar services.  The location makes for easy access in all directions. We made good use of the readily available taxis| the subway is also close. Beautiful rooms| we had 2 King suites which had everything you could possibly want in a hotel. The beds are so comfortable it is like home. We celebrated a special day and had room service breakfast| which included complimentary Prosecco| many thanks! This hotel includes breakfast| drinks all day| and cheese and wine every evening. All perfectly adequate and served with a smile. We must mention Gaby| she was on duty over the weekend| and such an ambassador for the hotel. Always smiling| always chatting| and rarely an empty glass| she is worth her…",
30,Perfect choice to stay in NYC,It is a great hotel to stay with really nice staff and services that is much above standards! Did you know that Mr. Big's apparment in Hollywood movie and tv series| Sex and the City is in this hotel? ;),
1,Almost more stars| but,Small but well appointed room with balcony.  The staff was outstanding.  Major problems were:  poor lighting| making it difficult to read or work in the room; and heavy construction next door on a Saturday. ,
124,Amazing service,Two night weekend stay at this terrific hotel on 26th and Park.  Was concerned with street noise but this place has great sound buffering.  We had a corner room| good L shape configuration and was spacious for New York hotels.  What makes this hotel is the service|  They go out of your way to make sure you are comfortable and taken care of.  It is easy to see why they have return guests and one of the top ratings for NYC.  Having breakfast| wine/cheese and WiFi included is a bonus.,
136,Fab,Just returned from a five night trip to NYC. Having not been particularly happy with hotels we'd stayed in on previous trips a new choice was needed for this trip and we couldn't have made a better choice.  This is one hotel that we would certainly visit again. The hotel is well laid out| nicely maintained| clean and in a good location for walking to the major sites.  All staff we encountered were excellent.  The ladies at breakfast were brilliant and efficient.  We had a king balcony room which was a good size and well equipped. NYC is a noisy city and you can hear the traffic from the street below (this didn't bother us) but not much noise from within the hotel itself.  The extras of all day coffee/tea| 5pm cheese and wine| breakfast and bottles of water were all a very nice…,
15,outstanding service,"Stayed one night before cruise. Great and it faced the street but was quite which is tough for a hotel in NYC. The staff was great. Helped us with dinner reservations and tickets to the theatre. They obtained tickets at a discount site instead of inflated ""ticket brokers"" This level of service for the guest was appreciated..Bed was great.  This was our 50th anniversary they sent a goodie and wine to our room. If you come to New York and want to feel like you are at home| this is for you. TOPS.",
9,Great hotel,This is a great hotel with impeccable service| very well situated. Our room was comfortable and quite. Breakfast was good. Valet parking was a huge plus. All in all we enjoyed our stay there. I would definitely recommend it.,
2,Unwelcoming and poor reception on arrival,"Im British. This was a greatly anticipated holiday to New York. Booked and paid for in advance. I travelled with a group of 11 choir members on a singing holiday. My passion is music|  my first time in New York  and I was to perform at a New York jazz bar. This was to be my dream holiday.  At the reception desk and there were plenty of staff to greet us. My colleagues around me were greeted with ""Good morning madam| welcome to the Giraffe Hotel"" My greeting was ""Good morning madam can I see your ID| I require passport and a credit card"". At this anonomally| I asked asked why others around me were not being asked to produce their passports. A manager came out. I explained that I was happy to produce my passport but insisted that everybody else did. Others around me already had…",
55,Loved this hotel!,This was great hotel in the perfect location.  The hotel itself was very clean and the staff very helpful and courteous.  The breakfast was great and the wine/cheese each nice was a nice touch.  Location was great in the midst of several restaurants and close enough to walk to Times Square. Would def recommend.,
75,Lots of extras,"We stayed a Friday and Saturday night recently for a quick weekend getaway. We got a fantastic deal on the room but even at a ""regular"" price there are a lot of extras included. We loved free continental breakfast| free wifi| wine and cheese happy hour| and gym passes. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Our room was a decent size with plenty of drawers and closets. Location is ideal for going uptown or downtown and plenty of good restaurants within walking distance. Also many rooms have balconies.   We look forward to returning. ",
110,Quirky ...Fabulous!,Exactly what we were looking for!  The hotel is perfectly updated.  We enjoyed a room a room with a balcony.  The hotel rooftop bar is delightful| as was the bar in the hotel lobby area.  Gabrielle remembered us and our drinks each day...her attentive| professional approach made the experience even more remarkable.  Sometimes it is all about the staff.  This experience was about the staff| the location| and the accommodations.  We will stay here again.,
7,Terrific stay at the Giraffe!,"This was our first stay  at the Giraffe|  which was recommended to us by friends who stay there regularly.   We found it to be situated in an ideal location for sightseeing.  Being a ""boutique hotel""|  it is a good size hotel| not too big. There was a feeling of intimacy about it. Our king room with balcony was very well appointed. It had a nice bathroom. We appreciated the nightly turndown service at which time  towels were changed again etc.  The continental breakfast available each morning was ideal and the girls working there were extremely helpful and friendly.  We very much enjoyed the evening wine and cheese.  Again| the girl serving there was so friendly| it was a joy going down each evening!   All of the stuff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful throughout our…",
72,Wonderful| classy boutique hotel!!,We love NYC| and usually stay in the Upper Westside area.  This time| we wanted a change and chose the Hotel Giraffe based on the reviews.  We are so glad that we did!!  This was one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had.  The staff is dedicated| knowledgeable and so courteous.  Over-all experience:  From check-in to check-out| staff was always attentive and polite.  The doorman is always available for help with luggage| etc.| upon arrival and departure.  They willingly offer to hold your luggage if you arrive before check-in.  24-hour snacks are available:  fruit| cookies| water| coffee.  Each evening| they offer wine (red| white| prosecco) and a nice array of appetizers (cheeses| crackers| olives| vegetables)  It really is popular to enjoy a few glasses of wine before…,
7,Gem in NYC,One of the best hotels we've stayed in. Understated elegance| very friendly and helpful staff| great location| excellent breakfast and evening wine and cheese included in the room rate| and lovely rooms where they have thought of everything. We'll definitely be back.,
2,BEST STAFF EVER!!!,I wanted to celebrate my birthday by taking my first trip to New York. I stayed for 5 days and 4 nights at Hotel Giraffe. My expectations were far surpassed. The entire staff was so accommodating| helpful and beyond amazing. I enjoyed talking with everyone who worked there. The hotel itself was perfect for me. There were fresh flowers in my room| tall ceilings| bathrobe and slippers provided| turndown service in addition to housekeeping| wine & cheese from 5-8pm| rooftop garden and the list goes on. Its location was central to all that I wanted to do (which was a lot)| so it was easy to take a subway train| cab and/or walk to get to my destinations quickly. I had such a great time that I'm already planning my next trip back! :),
2,My favorite hotel in NYC!,Hotel Giraffe is my favorite hotel in NYC!  It is conveniently located in a prime area away from the more touristy areas of the city.  The rooms are beautifully furnished| well equipped and super clean.  The staff is always genuinely very friendly| accommodating and professional.  Frankly| there is nothing not to like about Hotel Giraffe!,
20,Sticking their neck out,When management arrives today| the first thing they should do is compliment their staff for a job well done!  And| when management arrives tomorrow| they should do it again.  Valet parking is on E26th| not on park Avenue.  Clean| comfy beds| nice bath room| awesome lounge| free WiFi| nice tv| sound machine to down or noisy nyc. Would highly recommend and will be back.,
22,Always the best,I have been staying at the Giraffe for many years.  They never fail to provide the best service| a warm intimate experience in s big crazy city.   From the breakfasts to evening wine hours and beautifully appointed rooms| everything is great.   The staff is extraordinary and many have been with the Giraffe for some time so you see familiar welcoming faces when you return.  This hotel works for business| families| couples or solo travelers of any age.  The guests come from all over the world so lots of interesting folks to strike up conversations with.  The location is excellent for subway access and many fantastic restaurants in walking distance.  Can't recommend the Giraffe enough!,
2,Wonderful Boutique Hotel in NYC,I travel a lot. I stayed at Giraffe 2 weeks and enjoyed every moment of it. One of the best hotels I have stayed in NYC. Great location| wonderful facility (quality is impressive) and fantastic staff (can-do attitude and extremely helpful). Will certainly come back again. I would like to thank the hotel management sincerely for their efforts and care.,
30,Can't fault it. The perfect NYC hotel,We stayed here for two weeks and were absolutely thrilled with our choice of hotel. I go to NYC each year and usually stay somewhere different each time but next time I'll definitely stay here again. The room sizes are fantastic for any city but for NYC where hotel rooms are notoriously small I was seriously impressed. The rooms are clean and tastefully decorated and we had a small balcony with great views up and down Park Ave. Breakfast is included in the room rate and the coffee machine is available all day in the lobby. In the evening there is cheese and wine again in the lobby and most nights a pianist plays as well. The staff were helpful and friendly and the location is perfect.  I really couldn't fault the hotel. Back again for sure.,
13,New York| New York,Hotel Giraffe is in a great location.  The breakfast was very convenient.  We were only there for wine & cheese when we arrived | the rest of the time we we're on the go.  Lots of people seemed to enjoy the wine & cheese.  The service at the hotel was excellent.  We walked everywhere| Time Square| Museums| Central Park| Broadway...... also highly recommend the Big Bus hop on hop off bus tours to get you bearings. We will be back and we will stay at the Hotel Giraffe |,
1,Excellent service and stay,We stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for two nights from Nov 11-13. The service and amenities were excellent. They pay very close attention to the little details and have everything you need for a comfortable stay. The rooms are very quiet| clean and peaceful. We had an issue with our toilet one night at midnight and Christian came up and helped us immediately with a smile and a great attitude. We are very grateful to him.,
5,Hotel Giraffe a great find in middle of Manhattan,Nice complimentary breakfast in lobby daily. Fun Happy hour daily in lobby. Outstanding and pleasant staff. Use of hotel printer in lobby. Lobby was a happy place to relax and meet friends. Will definitely return soon.,
49,Great Service,Solid 4.5. Four of us shared a room at Hotel Giraffe the weekend of the NYC Marathon. The location was great| the rooms were very clean| and the included continental breakfast/afternoon wine & cheese were plentiful and much appreciated. However| it was the great service that really made this boutique hotel shine. We received a call at home four days before our stay to confirm our visit| which was a nice touch because it saved me the trouble of having to make that call. The staff was friendly| attentive| and responded quickly to requests. Two of our companions were running in the Marathon and they were very pleasantly surprised to see that breakfast was put out especially early for the runners that morning. In addition| even though we were technically checked out the Sunday of…,
1,526,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,Where to start? Is it the pleasantly decorated rooms and the large comfortable bed turned down with the chocolates. The excellent location and the peace and quiet as well as the quiet nights and good sleep quality. Is it the excellent|  considerate and very helpful staff. Or| is it the wine and cheese tasting that is available  every evening for guests. The continental breakfast is included and that| too| is served by helpful and friendly staff.
17,New York on election day,We were in NYC for a few days over the election period....amazing! Nice hotel with great staff and a few novel ideas...like free wine & cheese in the early evening! Nice thought. Only continental breakfast available which might let it down a little... ,
9,Hotel Giraffe Part 2,This was our second stay at Hotel Giraffe| the first in August 2016| and once again| the hotel and staff exceeded our expectations.  The bar had been raised since the first visit was excellent in terms of accommodations| cleanliness| service| and the staff who continually make us feel at home and comfortable in this quaint| 73 room hotel.  The location is ideal| 26th and Park Ave.| with subway stops| Madison Square Park| and Eataly very close and we continue to find new adventures and restaurants| like Upland right across the street which was superb.,
88,4.5 stars - Excellent boutique hotel,Small upscale hotel in convenient Park Ave. South location.  My room was large| contemporary| fresh and well-furnished. Comfortable bed with a nice pillow selection. I am not a fan of the bath/shower combination and don't like to see a shower curtain rather than a glass door| but other than that| the room was a winner. I will definitely return. ,
2,Outstanding Hotel and Staff!,I have been staying at The Hotel Giraffe for years and think it's one of the best places to stay in Manhattan.  The rooms are large| comfortable and always clean.  And| the staff is terrific. Of course the complementary continental breakfast| evening reception and 24 hour espresso machine are all great added benefits...,
86,Excellent low rise hotel,We chose this hotel for our 4 night stay in October after reading tripadvisor reviews and the hotel exceeded our expectations. Our room was one of two in the top (12th) floor with a balcony. When we came back to the room at night| the bed was turned down and classical music was playing gently in the background. Room facilities were excellent. Attentive breakfast staff especially Gabriella. Front desk staff were also exceedingly helpful.,
51,Will never stay anywhere else in NYC! If they are full| I'll change my dates!,Where else (especially in NYC) could nine women gather for college reunion weekend with complimentary delicious breakfasts and lovely wine and cheese happy hours in the cozy lobby as great gathering places! Not one staff member ~ from front desk| lobby servers| housekeeping ~ was anything less than wonderful and made us all feel welcome and special. This hotel experience shatters the bad rap that NYC venues often receive...I will literally never stay anywhere else in The Big Apple. Kudos| Giraffe!,
3,Lovely Place,What a perfect location for our romantic getaway. We will remember our Hotel Giraffe experience for many years to come. Location is great and the Hotel is beautiful. Thank you to everyone that helped to make this time away so easy to enjoy. We are looking forward to returning.,
9,Fantastic Location,Great Location to walk to a variety of attractions. The Subway is a few minutes away if you prefer not to walk. Fantastic Staff! Friendly and attentive.They couldn't do enough to help. The beds and pillows were the most comfortable of any hotel I have ever stayed at. The complimentary breakfast is more than adequate with a choice to satisfy your appetite. If you prefer a hot breakfast there is options close by to the Hotel. The complimentary wine and cheese is a great way to relax before dinner. Tea|  coffee| biscuits and fruit are available for guests at their convenience during the day. Our flight arrived early and as our room was not ready they were happy to store our luggage and invited us to have breakfast before we set out to explore the city. Would definitely return in…,
8,Great location| chocolates on pillows (little bit of joy every night),"Buffet breakfast was fantastic - even (cake) muffins!   Beautiful piano playing every evening| the whole atmosphere was relaxed and really ""new york-y"".  The people were very nice and the rooms (family room) had a great view of the street down below. I would definitely return| it was such a great location.",
1,Happiness,Clean| stylish| well appointed| great location.  Wonderful staff| loved every minute.  We celebrated a 60th birthday with our twenty something kids and had a suite with 2 private rooms.  Could not have been better.  Our nightly cocktail server had the sweetest disposition. Loved her!,
113,It's the little things that matter,This hotel was amazing I've stayed at several htels in NYC but this was my 1st time here. I found it listed under the top 10 boutique hotels in NYC. The hotel is quite unassuming but it's the little things that matter. The fact that JR remembered my name and greeted me every time I came in and out. That Gabriella was always so happy regardless of it is was early evening or early morning. Such a wonderful lady. Irma| who turned down my bed| closed the blinds| dimmed the lights and left wonderful music for my return.  So many other staff members who made my stay such a pleasant one. The fact that there were many extras available if I needed or wanted them without cost. The terrace garden which I would have like to have spent some time there had the weather been a little warmer.…,
89,Marriott Feel W Price,Really do not know to make of this place - which is a first as I spend 250+ days a year in hotel. Great location for my NY office- nice area. Arrive at 3:30pm and the room is not ready and really indifferent front desk staff - couldn't of cared less. Nice room but very 3 star Marriott feel bit at a price at a W Hotel level. Mini bar - empty so basically a mini fridge. No coffee machine but 24 hour coffee downstairs for free - odd! Free breakfast and wine hour (bad white  wine but good cheese). Fast wi fi but crappy desk lighting. Really a property of contradictions. I think in summary quirky. You may love it for it has a homesy feel but not for me again I think.,
2,Very nice place to stay,The location was close to all the places we needed to be and the subway stations.  The rooms were a very nice size and very well acquainted.  The wine and cheese evening - very nice and the breakfast food was good especially the latte.  Overall| a very nice place to come to when the day or night was truly done.,
118,Perfect NYC hotel,This boutique hotel on Park Avenue is near the Empire State and for those who like to walk | close to everything. The continental breakfast in the morning is fantastic | the wine and cheese at 5 pm is perfect and all you need is a late dinner out. Many good restaurants are close by| A suite is perfect for couples and families and the cappuccino maker in the lobby is amazing. Sit by the baby grand in the lobby and read a book or use their computer and people watch .,
3,Hotel Giraffe - New York,Wonderful staff| very helpful. Great location to walk to almost everywhere. Breakfast plentiful and the complimentary wine| prosecco| cheese and biscuits every day was very welcome after a packed day!,
323,Quiet hotel in an excellent location,We visited New York on vacations and decided to book this hotel after reading Tripadvisor reviews. The room was a Queen one (the King one had been sold out). It was not too big but we stayed most of the time in the city| outside. The room was clean and comfortable. The rate included breakfast in the lobby which was very good. Both the quality of the food and the service (we had juice| toasts| marmalade| expresso). In the evenings| there was a selection of cheese and wine and live piano music| which we enjoyed almost every day. Gabriela does a very nice job at the bar| both in the evening and also for breakfast. We asked for airport pick up transportation| which was managed from the hotel| even though paid separately| and it worked very well (since we arrived at Newark). I will…,
75,An excellent hotel - in a good location,"Giraffe provides excellent (and by NYC standards large) rooms in a ""different"" location a bit further south than most midtown hotels. The location (Park & 26) actually puts you within reasonable walking distance from both Midtown and Downtown attractions.  The staff was outstanding and service spectacular including a very pleasant surprise - good coffee for breakfast!",
55,Great getaway weekend ,My husband and I and four friends got a great deal at Hotel Giraffe and totally enjoyed our stay ! What a wonderful weekend !  We were in NYC for a concert and decided to make it a  weekend.    Complimentary wine and cheese at night for a designated time and continental breakfast in the morning ..::::: very nice.    Chic and clean.  Perfect combo.  Accommodating and friendly staff.  Boutique hotel in Flatiron district.     Walkable to Madison Square garden and shopping.   We will definitely return.  ,
66,First visit to NYC,I did not know where to start when choosing a hotel for NYC | decided to follow reviews on trip advisor .. was not disappointed ! Hotel Giraffe is in an excellent location | in that it is not too crowded/noisy yet it is close to everything central . There are also loads of reatsurants / fast food & coffee shops nearby . Really you can't go wrong !! Also staff are all very friendly & efficient - check-in was super fast . Rooms were clean | comfortable and modern . We enjoyed exploring NYC from Giraffe hotel and would certainly come back to this hotel again !,
358,Really top quality stay ,This hotel definitely lives up to its billing| an oasis of calm in the bustling metropolis! We booked it based on Tripadvisor ratings and a friend's recommendation| and we were not disappointed.  The service is second to none| from the doorman to the catering team and the reception crew| it is impeccable.  We opted for a quadruple room with balcony| very spacious| really well appointed and the most comfortable bed we've slept in for a long time! One problem this has created is that I now apparently need to buy a new bed and mattress when we get home!  Breakfast is included in your rate and is really very nice - I guess my only gripe about the whole stay though is that there is no control about seating| so there were three mornings where we as a family group of 3 could not sit…,
1,Gem of New York City,This boutique hotel in the Flatiron district couldn't have a nicer| more accommodating staff. The included breakfast is very good and a nice touch  and the evening wine reception provides a nice place to trade stories from the day| meet up with dinner companions| and collect yourself before dinner. ,
57,solid hotel with exceptional pricing,I stayed one night in the flatiron district and this was a very very solid choice for a hotel in that area. Nothing fancy but rooms were well appointed| the service attitude was exceptional and the price was right given the market. Room was clean| nice appointments| etc.  They could have invested in sound proofing the windows but alas| maybe that is a 3-4 star hotel thing.  I was on the 10th floor and frankly it was quite noisy from the road traffic. Other than that| i would stay again.,
122,Perfect Hotel for a stay in Downtown Manhatten,The Hotel ist located in the Center of Manhatten. The service is astonishing. Everyone was very friendly. We loved the wonderful Breakfast with the helpful waitresses. Absolutely perfect was Cheese and Wine from 5-8 pm as Apetizer before going out for Dinner. The rooms were not so big but very clean.,
2,Last night in NYC.,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel Giraffe. Staff were great| breakfast| fizz and snacks yummy. Tea and biscuits went down well before we left. Suite was clean| quiet and comfortable. We would come back.,
68,Perfect,Perfect hotel| location and a very memorable week.  Thank you for the special afternoon treats| such a pleasure to come back to the tranquility and relaxation with cheese and wine every afternoon| the lovely Gabriella| and hot coffees and cuppacinos after late night outings.  ,
2,Fall in New York City,Have stayed at Hotel Giraffe several times over the past few years.  The rooms are comfortable.  The location is nice.  Love the rooftop patio bar (when it is open).  The only negative this trip was the red and white wines they were serving in the lobby in the evenings was undrinkable.  They need to spend a little more to serve decent wine.  Everything else was great and we will be back.,
2,Exceptional Hotel Experience,"Ten night stay in October.  Energetic|  service-focused|  knowledgeable and unpretentious staff  made our ""fall fling""  NY visit memorable and relaxing in every way.  Highest level hotel hospitality experience in a terrific location.  King Balcony Suite on higher floor over-looking Park Avenue.  Excellent sound-proofing| room darkening window coverings and a high quality| comfortable mattress provided outstanding sleeping accommodations for the best NYC vacation.  Complimentary on site breakfast and evening wine and cheese offerings served by welcoming staff were added perks. ",
271,Low-key luxury,This is a true boutique hotel--small| quiet| well-appointed| professionally staffed and managed.  The complimentary wine and cheese service was excellent| and the expanded continental breakfast started the day well.  My room| booked at the last minute for a bargain rate| was small but perfectly comfortable| decorated in soothing colors with a good reading/napping chair and a fine bed.  Highly recommended.,
36,Excellent hotel,Stayed here for 5 nights at the end of three week tour. Excellent hotel with superb service from all staff. We loved the cheese and wine everynight whilst recovering from our days exploring new york city. The free breakfast is also very good | however we did find getting a table sometimes difficult as it was always busy.  Room was very good and we'll cleaned everyday. We had a separate lounge area which had a sofa bed for our son.  The bathroom was nice| however we did find the glass door an issue as you can see in| bit of an issue with privacy| especially with our son sharing the suite.  Plenty of places to eat nearby.  Overall would highly recommend staying here.,
4,Amazing Trip,JR was so helpful| emailing us before we arrived to help with getting tickets to a show and restaurant reccomendations and reservations. He was so kind as was everyone there. They went above and beyond. The location was great. The rooms were clean. The complimentary breakfast| snacks| coffee and cocktails was the best. After lond days of walking coming in and sitting down in the lobby to a cocktail and music was the best. Gabriella was so kind and friendly. We can not say enough good things about this hotel and its staff!,
1,Awesome Honeymoon!,This was the most romantic hotel to stay at! I surprised my new wife with a limo ride to the hotel| rose petals on the bed.  The staff was awesome! Breakfast was good! And getting around NYC was very easy.  My wife says she had a great time! Thanks Giraffe!!!  Anthony,
3,Perfect location and service,This hotel is truly excellent. Large room| comfortable bed| good breakfast| brilliant customer service and fantastic complimentary evening cheese and wine reception. The location was perfect - we walked  to Times Square| Greenwich and even back from Central Park. Would not hesitate to recommend and hopefully we will return.,
11,Fabulous stay at the Giraffe,Everything was great from the friendly staff to the continental breakfast to wonderful wine and cheese each evening. The room was very nice| however| the lighting could have been brighter. All in all| a great hotel and would stay there again.,
4,Consistently excellent!,We were upgraded to a suite during  our stay this time around.  What a treat!  The rooms are lovely| comfy| and immaculate. Wine and cheese in the early evening wonderful.  Always plenty of cookies and refreshing lemon water  for a late night snack:-),
1,4 day break in nyc,Great location.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Room excellent and spacious for New York hotel.  Drinks in the evening was a very nice touch.  The continental breakfast was fine for starting our day. We would definitely stay here again,
4,Nice| well-run hotel with spacious rooms,Stayed here for a girls' weekend with daughters and mom. Hotel is small and well run with very attentive  and friendly staff. We had a very pleasant stay. The room was spacious (for NYC) and the bathroom was also large and very clean. They have a 1 p.m. check-out which is also a nice feature! Great location - safe and close to restaurants and shopping. Very comfortable beds and nice lighting. Room has a tiny balcony so you can open doors for fresh air if you want.,
3,Perfect NYC Hotel,I finally found the perfect hotel in NYC. Service| amenities| location| comfort-- the 247 access to tea a huge bonus- even had the right soy milk-- but I digress. I also appreciated the upgrade and the partnership with Soul Cycle-- cannot say enough superlatives. The scale of everything also human| warm| inviting.,
92,Lovely hotel,We spent five very pleasant nights here.  It's a lovely boutique style hotel| situated in a convenient position for all the must see attractions.  The breakfast is excellent....way better than it's described on the web site.  Evening wine and nibbles again are more than adequate.....three hours of nibbling and sipping will certainly put a smile on your face.   The Slovakian girl with the dark hair who works at evening nibble time and sometimes at breakfast is a real asset to the hotel....management should take note and reward her well because she definitely deserves it.     We wanted a coffee maker in the room and had to wait a day for one to become free...why don't the management just provide one as standard in each room? All in all...it's not a cheap hotel but hey ho| you get…,
60,Great Stay in NYC,We stayed in a king room with a balcony on the second floor facing Park Ave. During the day it was curious to watch the street scene from the balcony. At night with the door closed| we were not bothered by noise.  If you are a light sleeper| a higher floor may be preferable.  The room was very clean| well appointed and a decent size for NYC.  One drawback was the dim lighting in the bedroom and bath.  It is something that could be easily corrected.   The location is very central with easy access to other parts of the city.  There are great restaurants in the neighborhood.  We had dinner at the hotel's restaurant and were pleasantly surprised.  It was quiet and relaxing with delicious food and excellent service.   What else makes the hotel so appealing is the professional| very…,
105,Boutique in the area,Most of the time we stayed in uptown | staying in this hotel opened a new window for NYC . The area is full of nice restaurants and shops .hotel is worth staying (price and quality balance is fine) .loved the service of continental breakfast,
1,Very friendly staff!,It was a very nice stay and the room was clean. It was a speedy check in and the staff were very friendly. We were very pleased. I stayed in the area to visit family and friends and I will come again in the future.,
1,Wonderful hotel...service impeccable!,We chose this hotel based on trip advisor reviews.  We traveled to NYC for a long weekend with our 1 year old daughter.  We booked a king suite giving us extra space for the crib.  The staff was over accommodating and even brought us soy milk each night for her bottles.  Would definitely recommend and will definitely stay here again!,
65,Cute Boutique Hotel in a great location,Stayed one night at this property recently and had a good experience for the most part. Check in was seamless. The room was a decent size and I loved the balcony feature. The bathroom was also well appointed and had quality toiletries| slippers and bathrobe to add to your comfort.  I wish I could recall the guys name at the front desk (blonde spiky hair cut) because he was really friendly and helpful with suggestions on where to eat| and things to see and do in the city.   Continental breakfast is a nice feature. They also have a happy hour every evening with wine and cheese.   The location is perfect. You're close to Times Square and not far from downtown which is where I like to spend my time when I visit NYC.  My only issues were the elevators....they seem quite slow. I also…,
33,Hidden Treasure in the Big City!,"We stayed for 6 nights at this wonderful boutique hotel.  Everything - from the champagne in our room at check-in - to the check-out - was in a word| ""PERFECT"".    We loved the complimentary breakfast and daily wine hour.  It was so relaxing to have a glass of wine before hitting the town for dinner.  And the all day coffee/tea was a nice touch after walking around NYC.    The rooms are spacious and clean - we had a corner suite| with a separate living room.  Maid service was impeccable every day.  The attached restaurant- Bread and Tulips - was delicious!  It was honestly one of the finest restaurants in the city.  Located in the flatiron district| this hotel is walking friendly to Empire State| and Times Square - and a short ride from the rest of the sights.    NYC is such a…",
52,what a wonderful experience !!!,booked this hotel after weeks of checking the tripadvisor again and again. there are so many hotels to choose from in NYC. i was looking for a small quiet not in touristy area hotel that made you feel like home and taken care of all your needs. the giraffe was right for us and much more. the staff was amazing in helping us and recommending. we loved our room with the terrace we were on the 4th fl so we did hear some street noise but it didn't bother us at all. breakfast was lovely . for me every night a bubble bath soaking my aching body from all the walking all day was a treat . it rained the first day so we were given umbrellas which was nice too. every little detail thought of the wine and cheese in the evening with a piano player just loved it . just a great experience.,
35,Fantastic location in NYC| great hotel and facilities-we'll be back,Had a great 6 day stay here. Lovely room | very clean with very comfortable bed and good amenities and facilities. Had a little balcony which was good. Location is fantastic 5 mins from the Flatiron very near useful tube stops and not that far to walk to the shops. Great restaurants nearby Eataly| ABC Kitchen and an amazing Mexican next door.The hotel has a wine (and prosecco) reception every evening with snacks and a great breakfast| all appreciated while the exchange rate is so bad. Hotel staff very helpful with directions suggestions for eating etc. Rooftop bar expensive but nice for a change although would probably go to Eataly's rooftop bar first.,
81, ,We will certainly stay here again when next in New York as we felt so well looked after. The service was excellent| from the helpful reception staff to the delightful team serving up the complimentary breakfasts and evening drinks and savouries - in particular Gabriella who was a charming and attentive host.  The evening pianist added to the relaxed feel of the welcoming lobby at the end of a busy day sightseeing in NYC.  The rooms were very comfortably set up with attractive furnishings and plants. The bathroom was clean and spacious with a good sized vanity unit with plenty of room for toiletries.  Our room had an exciting view of a New York street corner yet was quiet and we slept well. ,
114,Above average| not superior,My first two special requests weren't met.  I made the reservation for a suite with balcony 3 weeks in advance| through the hotel website| asking for a room on a high floor| but we were placed on the 5th of 12 floors. The staff was unable to change the room. Soon after our arrival| I asked for a coffee maker for the room| but was told that requests must be made before 6PM| but that coffee would be available in the lobby. On our first morning| jet lagged and out of synch with the time zone since we were coming from a month in Europe| I had to go downstairs for a cup of coffee. The Keurig-tyoe maker was delivered on the second day. The balconies are small| barely 2 feet at the deepest. No room for a chair| much less a table. From the 5th floor| it felt as though I was on the…,
97,New York heaven,We have just spent nearly a week staying at the hotel Giraffe. I had spent weeks trying to find the perfect hotel for our New York stay and so glad we chose the Hotel Giraffe. They were so helpful from carrying our suitcases into the hotel when we hadnt even got to the door- excellent service. I found this place through my love of the series SATC and it didn't disappoint. From complimentary breakfast (which you dont get at all new york hotels) to the wine and cheese evenings. It is perfectly located we used line 6 on the metro which got us easily to touristy things.They helped us out massively as we were in New York for a wedding| the night before they allowed the groom to stay at our hotel and I stayed with my best friend at her hotel (Hotel Hudson- FYI I wouldnt stay at Hudson…,
43,Great comfortable hotel,Really pleasant stay| the staff couldn't have been nicer. I'm afraid with all the positive reviews I won't  be able to afford to stay there next time. The house staff is top notch| rooms are cleaned 2x daily. Robes and slippers provided| however eye shades| ear plugs and even various type of pillows can be requested. Wine and cheese spread at 5pm with a piano player| great way to wind down after a day running around the city.,
7,Great!!!,The front desk was excellent.  We were originally cheduled a second floor room but were promptly given a room on the 12th floor.  The room| the service| the restaurant| the help.....all excellent.  Can not recommend strongly enough.,
1,A wonderful stay,We came to NYC for a couple of nights in October and we really enjoyed the hotel. The service was excellent. The lobby is very pleasant| with cookies and coffee and tea at all hours. The room was nice| with operable windows. Not cheap| but that's NY.,
147,Great hotel| convenient location,My wife and I had a few days to kill before getting on a cruise of New England| so we decided to stay in New York for a few days. Hotel Giraffe was highly rated on TripAdvisor| so we booked a suite for three days prior to embarkation. We were not disappointed.  The place is quiet and really unassuming| right on Park Avenue. Room was big| with a great sitting room and quite possibly one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in while on the road. Service from the front desk and housekeeping was top notch| with all ready to help make the stay more enjoyable. That included setting up transportation for us from LaGuardia. Free breakfast and internet was a big plus for us| as we planned to spend most of the days we had out and about| and so we appreciated the start and ability…,
1,Fantastic hotel,This is a brilliant hotel! From the moment we checked in we felt at home. The staff are all fantastic especially the breakfast and evening wait staff. They are friendly| quick and helpful and made us feel very welcome. The location is right in the hustle and bustle of Midtown but it doesn't feel like it once you're in your quiet room which is furnished beautifully in soft homely colors. Highlights for us include the brilliant breakfast which serves a good selection of cereals and delicious and importantly| fresh| fruit (mango| blueberries| melon| grapes) plus bagels and good coffee. But the best feature is the marvelous complimentary cheese and wine! We sat down each evening to prosecco and fresh humus| olives| cheese and crackers which was just a brilliant addition to an…,
3,Good,Best hotel for birthday party ...... Enjoyed a lot  Lovely stay  Yummy food  ..  ... “They offer complimentary wine and cheese nights as well as refreshments / snacks in the lobby at all times for guests.” ,
2,Short Stay-Perfect Services!,From the wellcome to the good bye| everything was perfect! The Rooms were clean| the breakfast very genereous; even to have a small Byte to have  between for free we have not Seen in another Hotel yet!,
14,Spot on for what we wanted,Great hotel| with great location.  Just what we wanted for our fleeting 24 hours in the city.  Room very well appointed.  Staff charming and helpful.  Didn't make use of the cheese and wine but lovely idea.,
128,Great place to stay in NYC,We have love our stays at the hotel.  It was a little less perfect this time| but still a place we highly recommend.  The positives have been covered by others - great little breakfast| pleasant cocktail hour| comfortable lobby| away from the craziness of the city| and so on.  The not quite perfects this trip - staff didn't know we were repeat customers (seems their system should track that)| doorman was absent a lot when we could have used some help| oddly the blinds in this room were not well cut and a lot of nightlight came in the room| some of the front desk staff was a bit less excited to offer help.  The bedroom was pretty bright at night.  Clearly these are minor things| but other hotels at their price point seem to get them right more consistently.,
6,Wonderful base for a birthday weekend,What a fantastic hotel! From the liaison prior to the trip| helping to reserve dining at restaurants| to booking private hire taxis| to the welcoming reception and personal approach| this hotel and its staff are amazing. We loved the relaxed atmosphere and the friendly eating environment| together with the excellent rooms and attentive maid service. Couldn't be better| highly recommend this if you want exclusive| boutique surroundings for your visit to New York,
33,Great location,The hotel is small| but the room is good| and the staff is very friendly. Breakfast is pretty decent| and the location is really good at Lexinton| couple of blocks from good subway lines. Missing is a fitness room but you get daily passes for the NYSC.,
74,Wonderful service and great experience overall,We loved the complimentary breakfast and evening wine and cheese. Our room was wonderful and the evening turndown service with chocolate was a nice touch| too. The service was exceptional! We checked in and were given a room without a balcony even though I'd requested this and had confirmed it earlier in the week. When I went to the front desk to ask about this| they apologized and offered to upgrade us to a deluxe suite with a balcony! Wow! I was impressed. We would definitely go back. Also| great central location to downtown| Times Square| theatre district| and Chelsea/Greenwich Village.,
13,Great place| highly recommend!!,Great hotel!! Loved our stay here! Very clean and accommodating!! This was our first time to NY visiting family| traveling with a toddler| and this hotel staff was great! Even gave us milk for her. Very good room size and nice attention to details. Wonderful filling breakfast with lots of options and perfect happy hour.  Tea| coffee and cookies before bed was a very nice touch. Would return without question!,
3,Found a Home,This is the third time we have stayed at the Hotel Giraffe. It is a wonderful place to stay while visiting in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Many of the same staff are still there which is a good reflection of the hotel. They are always friendly and courteous. The rooms always comfortable and clean. The breakfast foods and evening wine and cheese are always very enjoyable. We will be back!,
14,I'm in love,I stayed here one night in Oct 2014 during my first visit to US. This place was truly amazing. Location is great| room was very spacious and lots of natural light. Staff was very helpful| they also gave me adapter for my phone charger and recommended places to visit. Couldn't ask for more for that price.,
1,Great retreat in Grammacy,Hotel Giraffe was a delightful find situated not that far from the Flatiron building.  The room (402) was most comfortable| nicely decorated with a balcony overlooking 26th street.  Perfectly quiet at night. We enjoyed being able to have tea or coffee and a snack downstairs at any time with newspapers available.  Staff were most efficient and helpful.  Subway stations were within five minutes walk.,
51,Great stay!,We have stayed and their sister property| The Library| many times and enjoyed every minute. The Hotel Giraffe lived up to our expectations and more! Great location| breakfast staff was always very friendly and helpful. We love the boutique hotel and will never stay in a big tourist chain again in NYC| Personal attention in a quiet atmosphere.,
132,Outstanding Service and Lovely Room,"We had the occasion to stay in NYC for 3 days last week and chose this small boutique hotel based upon recommendations from a few friends. We especially liked the service between 5 - 7pm at night where they serve sparkling wine| red and white wines at the end of a day. They provide crackers| cheese assortments| veggies and more. After a long day of walking the city| we found this a nice way to relax.   The rooms are really quite lovely with a front living room| more than ample closet space| a master bedroom with desk| bar with refrigerator and a small bath. The decoration is comfortable and somewhat modern.  Great views up Park Avenue from our location. We were told that all the ""06"" rooms are the best. We were in 406 and it was great.   We were within walking distance of many…",
53,a nice hotel| but we expected more.,We looked forward to staying at this highly rated boutique hotel and it was clean| modern and conveniently located; however| we were disappointed with the breakfast (not enough seating to accommodate everyone| poor quality croissants and pastries)| and the fact that the rooftop garden was closed for an event for our entire stay.  Also| not the hotel's fault| but there was a lot of construction noise and high intensity lights shining into our room all night| and the window treatments were not adequate to keep our room dark.  In all fairness| Manhattan is noisier than ever| with extensive road work and construction projects.  We expected a bit more for the money from this hotel.,
7,Perfect Location,The hotel surpassed all my expectations.  The 20% off at Bread and Tulips was a great deal/ the food is great. You must try any pizza.  The breakfast and receptions is a great start and finish to your day. The Madison Square park near by is very enjoyable. Don't forget to stop at Shack Shake in the park.  I got this mushroom burger which was a fried mushroom with cheese. Shakes are amazing.  I would suggest sharing meals at dinner to cut cost since you do not have a refrigerator for left overs. It is a plenty food with the evening reception.  Make sure you try Real Tours of New York. This is a great walking tour that will get you to all the main attractions.  The Statue of Liberty is a must. Book your tickets to go inside in advance.,
56,Outstanding guest service,The hotel itself is very clean and comfortable| but the staff went above and beyond.  There was a malfunction with the in room fridge and a gift I had stored in there was ruined.  I called the front desk to inform of the fridge malfunction| and they immediately offered to replace the item.  They sent someone up right away| and then sent a runner to the store to retrieve an exact replacement... Such customer service is rare| and I really appreciated it.  Our overall experience at the hotel was wonderful.,
1,Gem in the heart of the city,Staff super friendly| wine and cheese happy hour is amazing. Room was super clean. Restaurants in walking distance. Just a wonderful place to stay especially when there's so much congestion in the city,
18,Great staff and relaxing atmosphere makes for a calm oasis in hectic New York,Staff are personable|helpful and friendly|room was very nice|comlementary wine and cheese is a lovely touch. for the money a cooked breakfast option would be nice but complementary continental breakfast is served with a friendly smile by staff.Overall a great place to stay and I have no hestitation in recommending it to others,
15,3 night break with friends,We stayed in a double double room for 3 adults. It was perfect. Lovely room plenty of room and decent size bathroom. The staff are excellent and very friendly. Breakfast is cereals| muffins toast and fruit plenty of choice to get you started. They do cheese and wine every night which was a nice touch. Hotel is in perfect location right in middle of Park Ave and bars and restaurants nearby. Would stay again,
1,Perfect,Very accommodating and classy place. They had everything we needed. The staff always knew how to help and went out of their way. Room was very nice with two queen beds for a double couple trip. The breakfast was excellent. ,
199,Lived up to Expectations,We booked this hotel primarily based on TripAdvisor rating.  We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in early/mid Sept as part of a 9 day stay in NYC (the second half was at the Sofitel NY).  We had not initially thought about this location either but thought we would give it ago.    We arrived at Newark Airport before 5am after travelling 20+ hours from Australia and after clearing immigration etc and getting a taxi we arrived around 5:30.  We had considered booking the previous night to have a room available but thought funds could be utilised for other holiday expenses.  We had pre advised the hotel of our movements and had very little expectations that room would be available.  When we arrived we were greeted warmly and told that they were full the previous night.  They invited…,
2,Close to Tabletop Show,Rooms are large considering your in NYC. Breakfast and early evening wine and cheese is absolutely amazing. Walking distance to Tabletop show on Madison Avenue and other tourist attractions i.e empire state building and Harald Square. Hotel restaurant bread and tulips is also good with other restaurants walking distance. I suggest Dos Caminos for great Mexican food  ,
2,Amazing find in New York City,Very friendly and accommodating staff.  Excellent rooms with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.  Great location. Lovely to have complimentary tea and biscuits during the day and wine and cheese in the evenings.  Would thoroughly recommend Hotel Giraffe to friends| family and colleagues.,
151,Great Boutique Hotel,Stayed here with my wife for 6 nights and cannot fault it in any way.   Situated in a great location near Madison Square Park and two blocks from the subway it is a lovely boutique style hotel.   All of the staff from the reception desk to the doorman to the ladies that serve breakfast are all fantastic - some of the best we have met anywhere and a real credit to the hotel.   The king suite we had was a superb size and overlooked Park Avenue South.   I love the breakfast is included and there is 24 hour tea/coffee/cake available.   Would highly recommend and if/when we return to NYC we will most definitely stay here.   You must try it. 😀😀,
6,Spacious| comforatbale and well appointed,I booked into Hotel Giraffe based on TA reviews and location near where I was working.  The hotel did not disappoint| nice staff| well appointed and comfortable room with a large sitting area and very| very comfortable bed with a ridiculous number of pillow choices.,
23,Ticked all the boxes,My husband and I stayed in a Classic King Suite for 7 nights in September and are still raving about our NYC accommodation and the level of service we received. The suite was very clean and roomy with little or no noise and the breakfast| evening drinks and snacks as well as all day availability of refreshments made the stay one of the best we have ever experienced. Special thanks to Gabriela| the doorman and the reception and housekeeping staff who were all unfailingly cheerful and made our stay one we will never forget.,
4,Best hotel experience in NYC,I've stayed in numerous hotels in NYC and this is hands-down my favorite place to stay in the city. Great location in a lovely neighborhood| with easy access to Flatiron| Grand Central and Midtown| and everywhere else via subway. The rooms are comfortable| spacious| and well-equipped. Best of all is the hotel staff| who are all friendly| thoughtful| and attentive. I will certainly return.,
5,Lovely| centrally-located boutique hotel near Madison Square Park,We had a very nice 2-night stay at Hotel Giraffe.  Our king room was spacious and luxurious.  The staff were friendly and accommodating| and they anticipated our every need.  The breakfast| snacks| and nightly wine & cheese spreads were excellent!  We enjoyed chatting with the evening hostess and listening to the jazz pianist.  We ate dinner at the hotel's restaurant| Bread and Tulips; it did not disappoint| and was of course very convenient after a long day of walking around the city.  We will be back for another visit the next time we're in NYC!,
4,Excellent stay in NYC,Loved our recent stay at the Hotel Giraffe!  It's a great location within a short walk to the Empire State Building or exploring the Flat Iron area. Easy cab ride to 30 Rock and the 9/11 Memorial Museum. Hotel rooms are beautiful and love the touches of a flower pot on the balcony and green plants in the room.  Turn down service includes chocolates and complimentary bottled water. (Who else does this any more?) Excellent breakfast with lots of choices. Nice wine reception each evening with light snacks. Coffee| infused water| and fruit always available. Service is exceptional. Will definitely be back!,
14,A New York City gem,Great location. Fabulous roof top restaurant with a view ! Friendly staff. Good morning breakfast in relaxing lounge. A real find in the heart of NYC. Walkability and easy access to subway and other public transportation.,
36,Lovely boutique Hotel,Great little hotel in beautiful area of New York. Staff are very friendly| great breakfasts| all day coffee and cakes and the best touch| wine and cheese evenings accompanied by pianist| so civilised. If you chose this as your hotel you're in for a treat,
5,NYC,Great hotel| great location. Room was very comfortable.  I will say the shower is in a bathtub which is rather small and slippery. The side of the tub are on a slant so not  a lot of flat standing area.  Need to be aware.  I did slip.... Convenient to everything.  Not too crowded for Manhattan ..  Hotel offers a great complimentary breakfast (first class with china and silverware)  great expresso and cappuccino maker Also has a complimentary happy hour from 5 til 8.  Wine| a variety of cheese| olives hummus| vegetables etc.  Very nice after a long day of touring or traveling!,
282,Nice hotel,Friendly staff.  Wine and cheese offering in the evening.  Small breakfast in the morning. Rooms are average size but nicely done.  Bed was very comfortable. Some street noise. Would ask for the highest floor possible.  Good value in a very pricey market.  Would certainly return.  ,
125,Outstanding stay for girls' trip,This hotel is nothing short of amazing. From the warm welcome and helpful JR on the front desk( very helpful as my friend's case didn't arrive so they showered us with toiletries etc) to the beautiful room. I had such high hopes reading other reviews so expected to be disappointed but I wasn't . We had a huge room each with a lovely juliette balcony. Towels replaced twice a day. Room cleanliness immaculate( thank you Carmen ne Irma). The thing that really made the stay was the location( near the gorgeous Madison Park) and all of the staff. The co start supply of coffee and cookies all day was a welcome addition and the free cheese and wine served by the delightful Gabriella and Laura were great. This hotel is brilliant best hotel I have stayed in from a service point of view.…,
53,Lovely boutique hotel on Park Ave!,My mom and I stayed here for a mother daughter weekend in NYC and absolutely loved it! The staff is fantastic and extremely helpful and we stayed in a room with a balcony that overlooked Park Ave! It was so fun to have a balcony while staying in NYC which is very rare! But the best parts are the included breakfast and wine/cheese/veggies reception from 5-8 pm! The breakfast is great with several choices and fresh fruit and coffee/tea/fresh juices. The wine and cheese hour was so filling one night that we decided to skip dinner and relax in the lobby before our show! We loved the private balcony from our room and will definitely return here again on another trip to NYC!,
12,Great Boutique Hotel,I booked our stay at the Hotel Giraffe based on great comments from others on TripAdvisor and so glad we did.  The Hotel offers a great Continental breakfast and Wine and Cheese Happy Hour.  Our room had a great view on the 12th floor with a balcony.  Our room was clean and spacious with a mini bar and a large bathroom.  The Italian restaurant which connects to the Hotel has great food and so convenient for those nights you are too tired to get dressed up to go out.  Thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay and would definitely stay at this hotel again.  Oh yes| and the staff is so nice and helpful with all my questions.,
19,Wonderful location and first class service,Stayed second week of September 2|016.  King Size room with a balcony facing Park Avenue South.  Really appreciated the complimentary breakfast in the morning| wine and cheese receptions in the evening (including Gluten Free options)| and Espresso and Cappuccinos available for guests all day long.   Metro stations across the street and about 200 feet north| depending where you are going.  A great location for sightseeing and moving around the city| parks and squares within walking distance.   Amenities in the room and entertainment system were as good as what I have at home.    will return to Giraffe next time Im in NYC.,
367,Perfect in Every Way!,This is a wonderful boutique hotel. The staff was amazing and the rooms are tastefully decorated and clean. Continental breakfast is included as is wine and cheese in the evening. There is a beautiful rooftop bar that was unusually quiet during our stay. The noise level is very low; we were on the third floor and did not hear any of the sounds of the city. This area of the city is a lot less crowded and this really appealed to us. We went to see a show uptown and we walked there and back. Loved the very personal service that you can not get when staying a bigger hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.,
3,Great Stay in NYC,The hotel was very clean and well appointed...Loved the extra amenities like the  wine and cheese from 5-7 pm| the generous breakfast and the delicious chocolate with turndown.  Most impressive| however| was the staff.  From recommendations| reservations and a genuine desire to be of service in any way possible| they were  top notch.  We loved the feeling each night of coming home after long days and having such a friendly greeting.  We stayed in a king suite| which is the perfect accommodation for those requiring 2 private spaces for sleep.  Do request the mattress topper for the sofa bed as this increased its' comfort significantly.  Try to  request a room on level 8 or higher....We were on level 7 and the street noise was occasionally bothersome(they do provide ear plugs and…,
27,Second visit in three months and love this hotel even more.,We love this hotel. This time we visited with two children and booked a family room with two queen beds for three nights. Plenty of space in the room with plenty of towels and as per the last visit| perfectly maintained by the housekeeping staff. The complimentary continental breakfast is a great start to the day and we were well impressed with the charming Gabrielle who rembered us from our last visit. Along with her colleagues they are great ambassadors for the hotel and carry out their jobs with grace and professionalism. The concierge and front desk gave us some great recommendations and organised our car for the return to JFK. We will use this hotel again| next time when we visit. We also plan on visiting Budapest and based on our experience with the Hotel Giraffe we would…,
366,It was lovely| 4.5 stars,The hotel was very nice as were the staff. My room was on the street side and I found the street noise a bit disturbing. I wish the room had earplugs as an amenity.  I also wished there was in room coffee. Granted| there was 24 hour coffee and light snack in the lobby| but having to shlep down there to get it was a pain. Otherwise| it was a really terrific hotel.  Comfy beds| and the continental breakfast was really nice quality.  I would recommend| and would stay again| I would just bring earplugs.,
2,A Real Gramercy Park Gem!,Located at 26th and Park Avenue South this intimate property has it all including a piano player during the complimentary Happy Hour.  Professional yet friendly service throughout.  Staff is accommodating and kind.  Lovely appointed rooms.  My new favorite place.  Perfect location.,
11,Such a pleasure,"I Came into town from a sailing trip along Maine's coast| and just fell into the hospitality and warmth of the giraffe.  I felt more like I was staying with a favorite Aunt.  The staff are professional.  The rooms are superb.  The overall ambiance is "" we want you to be comfortable."" Lots of attention to details.  I'm a fan.",
1,Great Stay in NYC,Good location. Close to two parks| subway and good variety of restaurants| (pubs| Italian| Thai| Indian).  Staff ranged from awesome to average but overall very good.  Continental bkf and happy hour wine/cheese was fantastic in a nicely appointed but casual lobby.  Live piano during the HH was a nice touch.  Prosecco flowed but some craft beer would have made it A+. Room was fine| a bit tight but clean and modern.  Room cleaning service did miss one day (and we were gone most of the day). Overall very good experience and we would go back. ,
1,An excellent stay - as always....,Friendly and helpful staff| a very comfortable| well appointed room| delicious breakfast and snacks on tap in the relaxed lobby - Hotel Giraffe has been my favourite NYC hotel for some years| and I continue to be impressed.,
102,Wonderful hotel in the Flatiron ,My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in a 2 room suite.  Room was great - plenty of space and a small balcony| with comfortable furnishings (but not fancy) and lots of closet space. Pleasant if simple breakfast included. Did not take advantage of the wine and cheese| but  looked good. For the price and room size| definitely a top rating.  Not as luxurious| historic or opulent as the leafing hotels in NYC| but for less than $500 a night it would be tough to do better.  We needed to be in the area for a wedding| but I'd recommend staying in this neighborhood on any visit to NYC.,
137,Absolutely brilliant ,I've stayed in New York a few times and I had booked another hotel for the majority of the stay.  This hotel was last minute for 2 nights.  However this hotel was absolutely perfect. Fairly central location.  However the best part was the hotel perks.  Rooms decent size infact pretty large by NY standards. Refreshments provided in lobby all day and cheese wine/prosecco in the evenings.. Unlimited! Breakfast good selection and the staff at the counter very helpful and friendly.  Water provided.. For free. Microwave provided for free! WiFi connection good also for free! I stayed at the Waldorf and this hotel was a million times better!  My only mistake not booking. Y some stay there (it was fully booked!).  If your considering this hotel you will not be disappointed at all. I will…,
4,Wonderful Hotel.  Truly a step above.,We went to NYC for the US Open and stayed at the Hotel Giraffe because the reviews were so good.  We could not have been happier.  They just do a few extra things that make the experience so much nicer.  First off| the rooms are nice and much roomier than typical NYC hotel rooms.  Secondly| every morning| you have breakfast available from 7a-10:30a.  That is just such a great amenity.  The serving ladies are lovely and the spread is decent.  I don't drink coffee but my husband thoroughly enjoyed having cappuccinos available in the lobby (no extra charge.)  There is wine and cheese at night but we were never there to enjoy it.  There is always fruit available in the lobby as well as coffee| cold water and often times cookies and pastries.  The best part was that checkout was at…,
111,Excellent hotel,Absolutely excellent small hotel - genuinely friendly & welcoming staff.  First class buffet breakfast a real plus| very wide range of fresh items & regularly replenished by staff who couldn't do enough for you.  First hotel we have stayed in that looks exactly like photos on their website.  Free WIFI| coffee & cookies available all day & cheese & wine in the evenings all a really nice touch & again good quality| fresh & constantly replenished.  The staff were really brilliant.  Good location.  Only downside was shower over the bath - would prefer a separate shower cubicle but bathroom quite small| but not a deal breaker.  Would definitely recommend & return to.,
19,Home away from home,I was so pleasantly surprised with the service and the accommodations. Never having stayed at Hotel Giraffe befor it really helped me glide through two days of business with a feeling at the ending the day  of coming home.,
1,Best Hotel Experience in NYC,I love staying at this hotel- the staff is extremely professional and genuine. Gabrielle who works in the evening wine and cheese reception even remembered me from two years ago! I wouldn't stay anywhere else in New York!,
168,They couldn't care more - go there!,Our experience of New York hotels has been patchy. Typically pricey| a bit less boutique than they think they are and all about how the appear rather than how they are. The Hotel Giraffe does not fit that stereotype. It's simply great. Belief the reviews.  Why?  1. The staff simply couldn't do more to help. They were fantastic. They genuinely want you to have a great time. Nothing is too much trouble. The free cheese and wine in late afternoon is a clue that they look at every detail. 2. The price! For a world capital city| it's great value for money. 3. The location is brilliant - easy access to Downtown| in the Flatiron by the Empire State| close to Grand Central and easy striking distance of Central Park and the Eastside.  4. Nothing is too much trouble - ask these guys if…,
46,Excellent Boutique Hotel Close to Fray but Quite,Stayed here over Labor Day weekend in a Balcony King Suite.  From the moment of our arrival| the service was excellent.  We arrived at 9 AM due to our red eye.  Of course| room wasn't ready so they took our bags| and invited us to have the free continental breakfast.  We then headed out for sightseeing| and they took our number to let us know when the room was ready at 2 PM.  Great room| nice balcony view toward Madison Square Park.  Room size was excellent| very clean| super comfy bed.  The hotel is close to everything via the subway| but in a relatively quite area which we like.  A few tram stops to Times Square and Broadway| maybe 5-6 to Central Park| also Lower Manhattan.  Good food options in the neighborhood (check out Atoboy if you like Korean small plates| just around…,
25,Super friendly and HELPFUL,All the staff of the hotel were extremely friendly.  But even better they were helpful| to.  Their recommendations and efforts to help us find a great restaurant for dinner were much appreciated.  Beds were comfortable| too!,
7,Wonderful haven!,Our 2nd experience staying at another of The Library Collection hotels| and we  loved it.  Spent 5 nights.  Awesome location| great amenities| service| and much more!! Highly recommend!! Can't wait to be back!,
289,We keep coming back!,We love this hotel.  Initially we decided to try it a few years ago because it was near my daughter and also because we stayed at their sister hotel in Prague and loved that hotel.  Every time we return we congratulate ourselves on finding this hotel and sticking with it.  The location is prime.  Away from the scrum of Time Square but really pretty close if you want to walk there.   I feel it's the perfect distance for any destination within Manhattan.  We always get the king suite and the space is amazing.  The rooms are immaculate and amazingly the rooms are very quiet.  Not much noise from outside.  Blackout curtains on the windows help and the sheets are soft and luxurious.  All the staff are excellent but I want to give a particular shout out to Gabriela who is the lovely…,
14,Gem of a hotel,Stayed here for 4 nights with my wife and teenage son. Chose this hotel as ideal location for us| and separate living room with fold out bed for son. This saved the cost of two rooms. Nice size room and fairly peaceful| apart for trucks running into evening due to beer festival in adjacent hall.  Breakfasts were excellent with good choice. Liked the complimentary wine and cheese each evening!  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Some great restaurants around the area. Liked Blue Smoke a couple blocks north.  Would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again if returning to New York.,
22,Easy Elegance in NYC,The service provided by the staff at Hotel Giraffe is something special. The rooms are clean and classic. With the flip of a switch you can lower a blackout shade to block out the city that never sleeps.   There is complimentary breakfast with yogurt| granola| pastries| toast| bagels| boiled eggs| juice| and espresso. There is also a complimentary wine and cheese bar at the end of the day.   We had a balcony on Park and were surprised at how little street noise we had. We slept great!,
47,Consistently good,This was our third stay at Hotel Giraffe and the only things to say are positive. The location is ideal because although it's in the heart of mid town Manhattan it is relatively quiet (for New York). The hotel is not too big so it's not impersonal and the staff are friendly and helpful.  The inclusive breakfast was superb and set us up for the day. The complimentary cheese and wine in the evening was an added bonus served usually by Gabrielle who was charming and efficient. The room was always spotlessly clean and the chambermaids very helpful. Where will we stay when we return to New York? Why The Giraffe of course! ,
9,Excellent Boutique Hotel,We took our boys (ages 15 and 12) for their first trip to NYC and I was warning them about how small hotel rooms are in NYC.  We couldn't get a suite (sold out)| so I was trying to set their expectations.  The room had 2 queen beds and it was laid out so well (huge bathroom) that we didn't feel like it was too small.  The rooms are very well appointed (desk space to lay out things)| nice size closet| balcony.  Very well done.  Plus| you can't beat the value for the included breakfast.  The front desk employees were always there and had wonderful tips.  We took the subway often and it is only 2 short blocks away from hotel.  Love this location| since it is on quieter city streets| so we always slept through the night.  A million thanks Hotel Giraffe.  We will be back!!  Love…,
29,Love this hotel!,I stayed at Hotel Giraffe for one night in March 2016.  I worked in the city for the week and my boyfriend came in on Friday so that we could go to a Broadway play and explore the city on Saturday.    I'm a big fan of the Library Hotel Group so I was eager to stay at Hotel Giraffe.  I wish that my stay was longer than one night as it was great.  The room was small but comfortable.  We had a small balcony that was right above Park Avenue (cool!)  The bed was really comfortable.  The bathroom was nice!  I loved the complimentary breakfast and coffee in the lobby.  It fueled our day of shopping and exploring.  :)  Thanks Hotel Giraffe!!,
3,A Great Base for our NYC Vacation!,Hotel Giraffe is a fabulous facility with outstanding staff! We enjoyed the daily refreshments in the lobby as our break from walking the city. Staff were top-notch| helping us first-timers navigate New York. Rooms are spacious and uber-clean| too. Lots of good restaurants and sight-seeing within walking distance...I don't think we'll stay anywhere else.,
1,Great location - great experience,The room was lovely with plenty of room to move around. I had a balcony with geraniums on it. The lobby has a cappuccino machine| wine and cheese| plus breakfast. The staff was very professional and helpful.,
68,Just right.,The Hotel Giraffe is everything we need in an NYC hotel. Great location (particularly for an NYU family)| well-appointed and nice-sized rooms| and Quiet - which is not always the case for hotels in this area. We loved the light breakfast each morning and the wine and cheese early evenings. But the best part is the friendly and helpful staff. Everyone on the team goes out of their way to make sure your needs are met - Actually| that is their way. ,
1,Beautiful Room| great size| wonderful amenities,I love this place| it's so close to Penn Station and the room was beautiful| very clean| and quite large for NYC.  Staff were extremely friendly.  Got a bottle of wine in my room with my stay (awesome!) plus they do a happy hour on certain days.  Also had late night snacks available in the lobby for free.  Room service is great.  Wish I had more time to explore the hotel but I was in NYC for an event.  Would love to come back however this luxury does seem to come at a price| unfortunately.,
1,Enjoyable stay!!,Our first time in NYC was made special in part to the warm welcome from The Hotel Giraffe staff! From check in to departure they all go out of their way to make sure your stay is very pleasant & comfortable. There are many extra touches that we enjoyed very much. Coming back to your room after a day of sight seeing to find fresh towels| bed turned down with chocolates| soft lighting| music playing softly & new water bottles was great! Continental breakfast was plentiful to start your day. As was the happy hour! We will definitely stay here again when returning! Again compliments to all staff in making this a great stay for us! ,
1,Very satisfied.,Staffs were kind and they offered good service. Complimentary wine and snack was good too.  I like the small but cute balcony and open window. Price was reasonable. I enjoyed staying this hotel and want to stay again next time,
5,Amazing Hotel,This hotel is great!  All the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. The rooms are very nice and comfortable. The hotel offers complimentary wine and cheese in the evening| which is very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend it to anyone coming to NYC!,
22,Just like home,We stay at the Giraffe Hotel every two years and each time it is just fabulous.  Same staff which means to me it must be a great place to work.  The included breakfast and the wine/cheese evenings are run by an outstanding team| including Gabriela and Laura| who treat you like family.  Every time we are coming back to New York| i look at lots of different places to stay| but always end up back at the Giraffe. The location is perfect and quiet (for New York)| close to transport and lots of good restaurants.  I hope it never changes!,
16,Great Place to Relax!,We absolutely loved this hotel!  My husband and I stayed at the hotel after moving our daughter into her dorm at SVA.  We were exhausted and this was such a restful hotel - from the water and cookies available on our arrival to the quiet balcony outside our room everything made for a wonderful City experience.  The wine and cheese reception was a welcome break for us| the room was spacious and comfortable| and even though we were on a low floor (2nd) we did not experience any issues with street noise.,
12,Our Favorite Place to Stay in NYC,This boutique hotel located near Gramercy Park and Madison Square Park makes any visit to NYC (business or pleasure) wonderful.   The hotel is absolutely delightful as is its staff.   The lobby always has snacks and beverages available| the rooms are well appointed and housekeeping does a fantastic job of keeping them tidy| and the bedding is perfect.   We have stayed at many hotels in NYC for business and for vacation (over the last 40 or more years) but over the last 4 years this has become our hotel of choice.  The staff at this hotel is amazing -- very helpful| attentive and always upbeat and pleasant.     The location cannot be beat.  It is very close to great restaurants| subways| parks and shopping.,
10,Unforgettable stay,Well located next to Madison square| Shake Shack (sorry for advertising) and metro| very nice staff| unforgettable wine and cheese managed by Gabriella late in the afternoon after a busy day (not at work but visiting Brooklyn| High Line| MoMa| Central Park| or any other points of interest); next stay in New York will see us there.,
2,Fabolous mid-town boutique hotel,Hotel Giraffe was a serene spot to get away from the hustle and bustle on New York. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay for a variety of reasons including 1) starting off each morning with a lovely complimentary breakfast which included fresh fruit| latte| bagels| cereal| juices| yogurt| expresso| and other items 2) enjoyable daily (5:00 – 8:00 PM) wine and cheese event 3) very friendly and responsive main floor staff 4) excellent location with easy access to everywhere in Manhattan due to various nearby subway stations.  In our opinion| a much nicer location to stay than then Times Square.  Only area of potential improvement is the room cleaning/restocking amenities consistency.  Particularly kudos to Gabriella and Arletty in the hospitality area who went out of their way to be make…,
43,Another great stay at the Giraffe,One of the few places where you go back to & the service still doesn't disappoint.  All the staff are so friendly & helpful.  It is in a great area & easy to get to most things.  Beds really comfortable & rooms have all you need.  Breakfast is great & always fresh.  Drinks throughout the day are a lovely little touch even though we only used it twice.  Didn't get a chance this time to go to the cheese/wine evening as we were always too busy perhaps next year| as I'm sure we will be back yet again.,
4,Trip to NYC,Once again our stay at the Giraffe Hotel in NYC exceeded our expectations.  The staff all go out of  their way to make our visit memorable.  In particular I want to acknowledge Gabriela| the Happy hour hostess| who meets every guest with a smile and welcoming conversation.  She can remember from a visit as long as a year ago whether you drink red or white wine.  She is a delight.,
5,My getaway,Excellent as always . We are returning customers many times over . European boutique style hotel. Everyone is very friendly and accommodating . Love the included breakfast and wine and cheese daily .convenient access to activities and restaurants ,
3,Gem in NYC,Hotel Giraffe is a wonderful boutique hotel where they service your every need. The continental breakfast includes fruit| bagels| yogurt and good coffee. The wine and cheese reception from 5-8 everyday is a great way to relax at the end of the day. The location is convenient and the front desk even provided a mattress topper for our pull-out sofa. I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again.,
1,Great Extended Stay,Every year| I go with my kids to NY to allow them to attend a program in the summer. Because of their age| they are not entitled to stay in the dorms at the various programs so I always seek out an apartment or boutique hotel for our extended stay. Hotel Giraffe had exactly everything we needed. The breakfasts were healthy| with an unlimited supply of EXCELLENT coffee. But what was most appreciated by me and my son was the attention the staff gave to us--we were treated as valued guests. The front desk responded to every need: mailing packages| business communication| excellent laundry service| bright and happy door service. I will stay again.,
71,Lovely Boutique Hotel,My wife and I spent one Saturday evening at the Hotel Giraffe.  Check in was fast and easy.  Because it was a weekend| we were able to park our car on the street just outside the front entrance avoiding a valet fee.  This is a small hotel with about ten rooms on each floor.  Although it seemed busy| it was very quiet on our floor.  We had a nicely appointed queen room with a small balcony and a spacious bathroom.  The included continental breakfast is served in the lobby area and has some nice offerings.  I especially enjoyed the self-serve cappuccino machine.  The best thing about this hotel is the staff.  Everyone was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful.  The Hotel Giraffe will be high on our list the next time my wife and stay over in Manhattan.  ,
83,Nice Place,Wonderful room and a wonderful view. My only issue was my room on the 12th floor of the hotel was directly next to the hotel's beautiful roof garden bar| which got very noisy until about 10pm. Apart from this| my room with balcony was a joy to sleep in. Recommended.,
1,Amazing Hotel,My family enjoyed an incredible weekend stay at Hotel Giraffe| and based on our experience| I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NYC. The rooms are large| clean| and extremely comfortable| and the hotel staff is amazingly friendly and very helpful. Make sure to enjoy the breakfast that includes a good selection of bagels| pastries| and fresh fruit| and I highly recommend taking advantage of the evening wine and cheese reception. I am a Tripadvisor junkie so I had read through all the reviews for Hotel Giraffe and had high expectations. This hotel exceeded even those high expectations. Stay at Hotel Giraffe and see for yourself. Enjoy!,
6,Loved it,"This is by far the best hotel I've stayed at in NYC!   I found this hotel by doing a search for ""quiet NYC hotels"".  My husband and I had no trouble sleeping here| which is the main problem we've had with other NYC hotels (street noise and/or noise from within the hotel - either preventing us from falling asleep| or waking us up in the morning).   The room was clean and spacious| and breakfast was included.  It's in a great location in Flatiron| very close to Madison Square Park (nice to sit in in the summertime| if you have time to kill before a show or dinner; there is a Shake Shack in the park and lots of great stores nearby).  Eataly is also nearby.  The staff was friendly and helpful| and our room was serviced promptly.  We usually stay in NYC 1-2x a year and plan on…",
5,oasis in the city,Lovely| clean| well appointed hotel.  Beautiful and comfortable lobby with drinks and delicious snacks available all day.   We visited on an extremely hot and humid weekend| and returning to the hotel was a welcome respite.  Will definitely stay here again when we visit NYC.,
35,First Rate,In town visiting family and wanted to stay somewhere different this time. Read the reviews on this hotel and decided to give it a try. I was so impressed that I had to post a review.  When I booked the room| I asked for a few extra pillows as I always do. Most often| the request is ignored| but not here. They accommodated us with 3 extra pillows upon arrival. The room and bathroom while not overly large(this is NYC after all) were more than adequate| very clean and looked modern in style. I loved the bed and the electric blinds. The balcony was a nice surprise to have in the city. In the mornings they offered a bit more than the usual continental breakfast and then in the early evenings they offered wine and cheese. The staff working this area were so accommodating I couldn't…,
3,Superb NYC hotel,What a great find! The Hotel Giraffe stands out for its amazing staff. Everyone-concierges| doormen| maintenance| housekeeping| and food service- went out of their way to be friendly| efficient| and helpful.  We were treated as if we were the most important guests in the hotel.  There are numerous complimentary perks- a lovely  wine and cheese offering in the afternoon| an extensive breakfast serving foods that satisfied both adults and our teenager| 24 hour coffee service| large loaner umbrella| and Sunday New York Times..,
1,Lived up to all expectations,We chose to stay at the Hotel Giraffe based on much research and on the excellent Trip Advisor reviews we had read.  The hotel met all of our expectations!  We are a family of four  with two teenage daughters .  We chose a Balcony King Suite and an interconnecting Balcony Double on the tenth floor.  The rooms were perfect and the location in the hotel very quiet.  Breakfast was a pleasure and the staff couldn't have been more helpful or friendly .  The complimentary cheese and wine in the evening a perfect end to a hectic days sightseeing and the rooftop bar a second 'haven' at the end of the day.  The hotel's location was absolutely perfect and we were able to walk to many more places than we at first thought. Without question we would recommend this hotel and would certainly…,
7,They did it again. Exceeded expectations and went above and beyond!,To celebrate my mom's 86th birthday my sisters and I planned a few days in NYC. We had stayed at the Hotel Giraffe a few times before and of course knew it would be the perfect place to take her. She is not real mobile and a small boutique hotel was just what she would like. To say that the staff went above and beyond to make our stay a true delight would be an understatement. The breakfast and amenities in the intimate lobby were great for conversing and made her feel like a queen. Highly recommend AGAIN and will be going back in the future.,
5,City break with kids,The hotel is centrally located in Manhatten| an easy walk to Maceys| The Empire State building| & Grand Central Station. A perfect location for moving Up or Downtown.  We found all the staff at this hotel very welcoming & attentive.  The rooms were larger than we expected & very quiet & comfortable.  The free wine & cheese reception each evening is a nice touch| & remember to check out the small roof top bar area which has a relaxing vibe. This hotel is definitely worth staying in if you are visiting NYC. ,
5,Highly recommended,"I have stayed here twice & am planning another trip for the holidays. I loved this place. You can't beat the location or the service. The districts diverse shops and excellent restaurants draw New Yorkers day and night. The historic Petes Tavern helps New York treasure its past while the numerous ""Silicon Alley"" internet companies bring the city into the future. A wonderful hotel| highly recommended.",
14,Great hotel| great location| excellent service,Stayed here to recover from a minor operation and couldn't have been happier. Staff was warm and accommodating| room was spacious and clean| and location was central. I couldn't have been happier and healed in a peaceful| welcoming room. I kept extending my stay and what was supposed to be one night turned to three. I recommend this hotel hands down. ,
4,Great location and service,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here with teenager children | the staff could not have been more helpful in terms of advice| restaurant reservations etc. Breakfast was excellent| generous snacks| rooms very comfortable| location perfect.,
9,An Oasis in the City,The Hotel Giraffe exceeded our expectations on many levels.  The location in the Flat Iron district is excellent as Madison Square Park| great restaurants| check out La Pizza Fresca Ristorante| shopping and the subway are all less than a five minute walk.  The room's size| cleanliness and attention to detail were outstanding.  The morning breakfasts| variety of coffees| fruit and cookies available 24 hours a day| and of course| the early evening wine| cheese| crackers and fruit were a wonderful way to begin your evening before heading out for dinner or a play.  But| what truly made the Hotel Giraffe an oasis in the city were the people| particularly Gabriella and Jose| who made our stay very special.,
77,As good as three years ago,I've reviewed this hotel before and we were pleased to find it had not dropped its standards. We booked directly with the hotel three days before our intended arrival and found rooms which were around $75 cheaper than through Internet sites. This was because we took the no cancellation option.,
34,Fantastic Stay!,"Hotel Giraffe is top-notch in every way and is now my ""go to"" hotel in Manhattan!  Let's start with the service-- when we arrived| the street was closed for an event and we could not  drive to the hotel.  We called and the hotel concierge arranged to meet us at the nearest point where there was car access and valeted the car and took care of our bags.  Check in was smooth and friendly--and the desk staff remembered my name all during my stay!   They  offer a quality complimentary wine and cheese reception nightly and a complimentary breakfast that was great-- both served by a lady who was really gets the meaning of the word ""hospitality"" and obviously took great pleasure in keeping her guests happy (as does all of the staff).  The rooms were attractive| very comfortable (great…",
1,These guys are Great,This is a great hotel. They provide wonderful service and an awesome location in the city. Not a far from the tourism destinations and great access to Subway stations as well. You wont be disappointed  ,
39,Second Stay ... and still the perfect hotel !,After a memorable stay at Hotel Giraffe in October 2014| we returned again this year in July (5 – 15)| and it was clear that| from the moment we started planning our trip| Hotel Giraffe just had to be a part of our second visit to New York.  As we were 3x adults| we booked a Balcony King Suite| which was perfect in terms of space!     For our family| everything hit the right spot from the cleanliness| the appointment of the rooms| the amenities| the morning continental breakfast| the bottled water and the 24-hour availability of coffee/teas/biscuits in reception. I loved the roof garden for my early morning coffee; and the daily cheese & wine (5-8pm) was the perfect pick-me-up after a day of sightseeing and pounding the city’s sidewalks!   For my husband| this was his first stay…,
19,Wedding Weekend,We stayed at Hotel Giraffe attending a wedding and enjoying NYC.  The hotel was lovely| sparkling clean and has a wonderful staff.  Rooms are very comfortable and well appointed.  Everything was 'yes'| including a last-minute request for a party van to take a group of us to Brooklyn for Saturday evening.  The lobby was very comfortable with a nice continental breakfast and refreshments throughout the day.  ,
15,Great location and lots of free perks!,Spacious room.  Free wine happy hour and perfect location.  What more could you want?  The vibe feels more like going to a friends house than a hotel--it's that friendly.  The rooms could be updated but a great 4 star in NYC.,
9,Best hidden secret in NYC,Can't say enough about this hotel. Every person on staff is amazing.  Clean and well appointed rooms. Beds so comfortable. Shower and  bathroom fantastic. Complimentary breakfast fabulous. This is a wonderful property.  If you staying anywhere in city. You must  stay here   I love it!!!,
4,My favourite hotel in Manhattan,Following a visit to Giraffe in 2014| we returned to Hotel Giraffe for a 5 day break from 23rd July. We were extremely delighted with the Giraffe on last visit and I'm pleased to say that it continued to excel again on this visit.  All aspects of the Giraffe experience really are top class. From the simple booking (with discount for returning guests) to arranging transport from the airport this hotel really delivered great service.   Giraffe goes to lengths to ensure everything that you could require is provided to make for a comfortable and relaxed visit - from free WiFi| bottled water| complimentary breakfast| newspapers and snacks throughout the day. We enjoyed the evening wine and cheese on several occasions.   Hotel location is perfect| away from the busy tourist areas| yet…,
5,Perfect,Thank you for the perfect stay at your hotel! The service was excellent| the breakfast delicious and fresh and the room very clean. The view from my balcony was amazing! It's the perfect hotel for sightseeing because you can walk to many points of interest! ,
453,Lovely Boutique Hotel with Amazing Amenities,Had a lovely overnight get away at the Hotel Giraffe. Boutique type hotel Excellent location. Not too far a walk from either downtown or mid town/theatre district. Very clean and comfortable room. We upgraded to a balcony king which was really nice with a small balcony overlooking the street. Shower was not a stall type but excellent. Lovely amenities of wine and cheese in the afternoon and breakfast with excellent coffee included in the room rate. Water in the room. Would definitely stay here or any of the hotels of this small chain.,
2,Welcoming,I have been staying at Hotel Giraffe for the past 10 years.  I always feel so welcomed and so comfortable here.  The staff is extremely nice and accommodating.  The amenities are unmatched by any other hotel I have ever stayed in.  I plan on staying here during my business and family trips for the next 10 years.,
48,B-Day Fun,From the arrival greeting and then the easy check in| this place is managed extremely well.  Wine and cheese party nightly - what a fantastic extra. Breakfast had a bunch of choices and the espresso was great. Having a balcony made our room special.   It almost as if the valet knew when we were checking out as our car was already at the curb.   We will definitely be back. ,
318,Modern hotel| good location,This is a modern hotel with all the things you need for at stay I New York. Breakfast is included in the rate and you also get wine and cheese tasting everyday in the afternoon/evening. Coffee| tee| water| fruit and snakes are also free. The hotel has a rooftop threes where it is possible to enjoy a drink or just to  relax in the sun. The rooms are modern and features everything you need. The hotel has a very nice Italian restaurant in the basement. The subway is located nearby for easy transportation around the city.,
14,A Hidden Gem of a Hotel,We stayed as a family of four for four nights in July 2016 at the Hotel Giraffe.  I had spent time trying to find a smaller hotel that would  suit our very special family trip & this was the one we chose.  From the moment of booking to the time the cab collected us in the evening| the staff were so friendly| helpful & attentive.   It was so lovely to be in a smaller hotel where the guests can recognise the staff instead of seeing different people everyday.  The Hotel offered the option of feather & down pillows| which were wonderful| the balcony guestroom with 2 queen beds was ideal for us & extremely clean on arrival.   The Hotel price includes a continental breakfast (fantastic  & a huge choice of foods)| plus a cheese & wine event 5-8 pm every evening which was very welcome. …,
1,NYC week getaway,We thoroughly enjoyed our first stay at the Hotel Giraffe| and will highly recommend it to others.  Great hotel and location.  Breakfast was simple but had everything we liked.  Rooms were very quiet.  The only thing was that we did miss having a dedicated concierge.,
2,Terrific Celebration Weekend,"We just returned from a stay at the Hotel Giraffe in a part of NYC now called NOMAD.  This hotel was the number four ranked Hotel in NYC on Tripadvisor and when we checked in and went to our room| we were somewhat disappointed. The hallways were very pedestrian| and the room| although clean and beautiful| didn't have a ""wow"" factor.  However| after the completion of our stay| we can honestly say that the Hotel employees and the services were the best ever. We're already planning our next trip back.  The employees answer every request with a can-do attitude and never once made us feel that any question or request that we had was an issue.   It rained the entire time we were in NYC| but between hotel provided umbrellas and hotel activities| it didn't ruin our celebration at all. …",
6,Nice touches,First time at HG - had a terrific time. Welcoming staff| generous rooms| and the 5pm-ish presceco and snacks was most civilized! Was a one night only stay for us| but we felt very well treated. Nice continental breakfast included| with good coffee too. Best hotel experience in NY in quite some time.,
1,Hotel Giraffe,Hotel was well decorated| room size was perfect| the staff was very knowledgable and friendly and the price was right!!!   They also provided a continental breakfast daily which was lovely and Laura makes great Iced Tea. Nightly Wine and Cheese reception was a great treat to return to after a long day of sightseeing.,
341,Best hotel in the world,First trip to NYC to celebrate hubby birthday and our wedding anniversary| stayed at hotel Giraffe| what a beautiful fabulous hotel. From my initial email enquiry till moment of departure everything was first class. This is a beautiful elegant and amazing hotel| nested in a wonderful location. We had a king balcony suite this was fabulous and the staff were ever so helpful and friendly. I can not wait to go back to this 5 star hotel it's ultimately luxurious. It's simply the Best Hotel in the World| thank you for making our very first trip to NYC a special one.,
3,Penthouse / rooftop wedding party,My husband and I got married in California and wanted to have a small reception in the city for friends and family. We called many hotels and restaurants and struggled to find a place that was the right vibe| location| and had great customer service. Then we talked to Ashley and Emily at the Hotel Giraffe and knew we were in the right place ~ they helped me from booking the penthouse to meeting me the evening of the event for set up and everything in between. We did everything via email and phone| and not once was I concerned about not having seen the space or tasted the food because it all was so seamless. They guided me on food choices| quantity| bar hours| etc. The event was wonderful and our friends and family were able to focus on the evening and have a fabulous time. I…,
26,An Oasis,We searched many hotels and vacation rentals before booking Hotel Giraffe for our July 2-7 NY visit.  We were not disappointed.  We booked a King Suite and it was perfect for this little high school grad trip with a niece.  Good location to subway and plenty of eating options.  Front desk staff were excellent as were the ladies working the morning breakfast and afternoon wine and cheese.  Suggest asking for a higher room.  We were on the 3rd floor and at times the street noise was like it was in the room with us.  But| that didn't keep us from sleeping most nights.  So| we recommend this hotel and we will be back on our next visit to NY.,
53,6 stars,I wish I could give this hotel more than 5 stars.  We stayed from the 21st July for 8 nights as a family of 4| including two children.  We were all made to feel incredibly welcome.  Repeating what others have said| room spacious and plenty of room for clothes for 4| breakfast great and evening wine and nibbles greatly appreciated.  The service in this hotel is exceptional.  The local is great| away from most of the hustle and bustle| but only 10 minutes walk from the Empire State building and about 25 minutes to Times Square.  Some great local restaurants.  Air Con| very effective throughout the hotel and room after a day out on the streets.  Keep doing what you're doing.  We'll be back.,
99,Excellent experience| beautiful property- best of all staff & service!,My husband and I recently traveled to NYC and on a recommendation from my parents decided to stay at the Hotel Giraffe. The location and ease of use to the subway (between 23/28th st. & park ave) was perfect for us! We not only enjoyed the location| but also the service from the staff at the hotel. They catered to any wish/need you could have... little touches on top of a clean| well equipped building/room made it a perfect| pleasant stay. Our most enjoyable moments were during the cocktail hour and breakfast| both included in the stay. They offered a nice array of cheeses and olives with white| red wine or prosecco| all served by a lovely| pleasant staff. Breakfast was much the same- great staff ready to get you whatever you would like. We were offered a nice assortment of…,
52,Perfect hotel for girls NYC reunion,Loved this boutique hotel| where we had 5 rooms for a girls NYC reunion. $45 for valet parking (decent by NYC standards). No complaints about well appointed room with balcony| fresh plants| bottled water| decent bathroom amenities| bathrobes and slippers| even an umbrella (it was a rainy weekend). Very comfortable lobby where we enjoyed happy hour (wine| prosecco| cheese & crackers| crudities) and a continental breakfast (for $5 delivery charge| it can be sent to room as well). Very nice staff. Orchids abounded. Access to NYSports Club gym. Lots of good restaurant choices very close by (including excellent food at Dos Caminos and SaraBeths for brunchl trendy Upland across the street).,
1,Terrific hotel,Just back from New York and think this is a super base to visit the city. Staff very friendly| nothing was too much trouble. The room was spacious and very comfortable| facilities very clean and well stocked. The breakfast buffet was served by caring and attentive staff| the same for the evening. I loved the roof garden| just a pity I didn't have enough time to really take advantage of it. I'd go back anytime.,
59,Booked again for September!,We actually stayed at the Hotel Giraffe five years ago for our 15th wedding anniversary and I am so glad that we discovered the Library Collection. We stayed at the Elysee two years ago and it was excellent but I really missed the wonderful atmosphere of the lobby at the Giraffe. We are coming back again in September for our 20th| and just talking to Ervin at the reservations desk was such a pleasure. He welcomed us back and took special care to make note of our previous stay and promised us a wonderful time. Considering the wonderful continental breakfast| coffee| water and snacks all day| pre-theater snacks and drinks| you save a lot of money on food and drinks and it becomes very comparable to the big hotel giants in town with much smaller rooms! See you in 54 days!,
215,What more could you want?,Rooftop Garden...wine and cheese...complimentary breakfast. Stayed two week nights in a standard room ($327 plus tax per night)| which was clean and relatively spacious. We appreciated the 1 pm checkout time. The subway is within easy walking distance (6 train) and cabs are ubiquitous on Park Avenue immediately out the door. Restaurants abound nearby from McDonald's on up to Sarabeth's and numerous in-between. The staff was simply outstanding...from the desk clerks to the breakfast attendants to the wine and cheese lady. They made us feel like royalty. Complimentary breakfast is served daily to include coffees| juices| fruit| cereal| bagels| oatmeal| hard boiled eggs| croissants| muffins| scones| and Danish pastries. In the evening| complimentary wine and cheese is served in the…,
11,Charming stay,Great location and nice hotel. The rooms are a very nice size for NYC standards. While I read raving reviews about the service| I didn't have the same experience. The employees were certainly nice especially the food and beverage folks| but I have to say the front desk assistance was just OK. We were not informed on everything about the hotel during check in| I.e the use of Sports Club gym| or the roof top bar! Learned these features on TripAdvisor! Two warnings about the rooms|| definitely request a higher floor and while the hotel has a no smoking policy|| they must allow guests to smoke out of the balconies. Our room wreaked of cigarettes|| was disgusting. Request a room with no balcony. ,
33,Great boutique hotel.,A small but very comfortable hotel in a good location. Really helpful and friendly staff for whom nothing seems too much trouble. Lovely rooms which are spacious by NY standards. Good continental breakfast included| as are free wine and nibbles from 5-8pm. Should I ever return to NY it would be my first choice.,
80,don't judge it from the outside!,As soon as i saw the hotel| i just wanted to leave....BUT....I was so wrong...Super friendly people everywhere. from the doorman to the reception it makes you feel wonderful. The room was clean. We had a room with 2 queen beds and a small balcony. Service (we asked for extra towels| was super fast). Very comfortable beds| clean bathroom (i hated the curtain but it's ok). The hotel itself is superfriendly with kids too. Breakfast ladies| amazingly friendly too. Breakfast was good| don't expect fried eggs and bacon| but more like bagels| corn flakes| boiled eggs etc. You feel very much at home. Upstairs on the 12th floor| there is a nice outside area where you can have your coffee or your glass of wine in the evenings. You can also smoke up there which| ashamed to say| but it was…,
41,Outstanding - Again,Brilliant Hotel in a great location. As soon as you enter to check in it is a very welcoming place. Everyone is smiling| both staff and guests which tells you everything. Breakfast is such a pleasure| you can just sit there and enjoy. The evening drinks and cheese event are such a nice touch that you will always come back again. The rooms are great and all needs are catered for. I would recommend this hotel to everyone who just wants that little bit of extra in New York. Looking forward to a return visit.,
125,Great Small Hotel for Families,We chose to stay at the Hotel Giraffe in NYC because we could reserve a room with two beds for our family of four| and because of the positive ratings here on TripAdvisor.  Most of our past stays in NYC have been in Midtown or Central Park| so we also wanted to stay somewhere a little different.  Hotel Giraffe deserves its positive reviews because of its room quality and friendly service.  Our room was a Balcony with 2 queen beds.  It made good use of the given space| and we never felt cramped even with four people given the context of New York hotels.  The balcony was a nice added plus because the big doors provided more light and you really felt that you were in the city when you opened the doors.  The downside is that our room looked right into an office building| so you…,
3,Amazing!,The staff at the hotel go above and beyond to make the guest feel welcome and comfortable.  The rooms are quiet| clean and comfortable.  They offer free breakfast and a wine/cheese hour every day which is always a nice treat.  We stay here every time we're in NYC.,
87,Almost perfect this time,My husband and I stayed here exactly 4 years ago on my birthday| and loved it so much this year we decided to bring family with us. Again we could not be more pleased with the amenities--complimentary breakfast| small snacks and drinks throughout the day| wifi| comfortable beds and a great check-out time (1:00)  But I also remembered that last time I thought the glass window to the bathroom doors was weird and kept the toilet area from feeling private. When you have a big family over a couple of rooms| this was immediately a concern and we asked the front desk if they have something for coverage (as they had told us they did last time on our way out). A desk clerk promised they would take care of that right away. By the next morning--still no coverage.  I went downstairs again|…,
71,Fun times in NYC,The Hotel Giraffe was a great pick. It is in midtown very centralized to everything. The subway stop is 1 block away and all the major tourist attractions are easily and quickly accessible.  The rooms are very clean| roomy and the staff is great. The best part is they have a delicious and filling breakfast included and cheese| crackers and wine in the evening. The gals who work the breakfasts are wonderful. Very thoughtful| attentive and make you feel super special.  I would stay here again no questions asked.,
21,Great Stay!,We only stayed for one night but that was enough to guarantee we will be staying again. The property is very clean and the rooms are some of the biggest I have seen in NYC and I loved the decor. The location is spot on| close to great restaurants and shopping! The staff was excellent| very friendly and attentive. The lobby is a great place to hang out and grab their complimentary wine and cheese in the evening and breakfast in the morning. I would highly recommend staying here!,
29,Top Spot in New York,Ideally located at the edge of the Flatiron District| Hotel Giraffe is great base for any NY visit.  Access to the subway system is only a short walk away.  Good rooms and with continental breakfast and the evening wine and cheese reception included in the room tariff| this represents real value. The staff are genuinely friendly and helpful - special mention to Gabriela host of the evening reception. We will return!,
85,Always a great stay,I always enjoy staying at the Giraffe. The location is good| the staff is nice| the rooms are comfy and a good size| and the wine hour and breakfast are such a great touch. The only drawback is that the food at the restaurant isn't very good and therefore you are out of luck for room service. I got it once and won't do that again. ,
1,Staying in New York city,Great hotel and service. My wife and I have stayed here a number of times and enjoy it each time. The staff conduct themselves very professionally and have always been unquestionably friendly| welcoming and helpful in accomodating any requests| question or needs - whether at the front desk| at the door| with luggage| catering breakfast and evening drinks or cleaning our room. The rooms are comfortable and well apportioned. The Giraffe is our first port of call when searching out where to stay whenever we are heading to New York city. I recommend Hotel Giraffe to my friends and colleagues.,
17,Great hotel,We stayed here for 2 nights in July.  Central location| short cab ride to museums and attractions.  Friendly staff| clean rooms| good complimentary breakfast| & free wifi.  Our teen daughters were in a separate room and enjoyed the hotel as well. We would defiantly stay here again.,
2,Fantastic Hotel,Loved this hotel - can only say good things about it from the moment we arrived until the day we left. It has all the lovely things and services you used to get in a hotel 10 years ago - now most of them have done away with small things like - water in your room| a real box of tissues| plenty of towels| tea and coffee| fabulous cheese and wine reception and a great breakfast service too. The staff could not do enough for you either and gave us some great tips on what to do in New York.,
352,Fantastic service| location and staff,I stayed here in a king balcony room for 8 nights and it was great. Nothing is too much trouble| the bed and bedding is great. I used my ear plugs as Park Avenue South is noisy but the sleep sounds on the radio were also great. Very clean| excellent housekeeping.  Enjoyed the breakfast| drinks and cheese nod the ease of grabbing a coffee whenever you needed one iced or not. Will definately be back don't forget bread and tulips which was also good and the quick nip to the subway.,
1,Celebrating my Birthday!!!,It was such a pleasure to stay at Hotel Giraffe on my birthday with family members.  Our room and customer service were absolutely excellent from the moment we walked in to the time we left.  We will highly recommend the Hotel Giraffe to all our family and friends.  ,
7,Kudos to the Hotel Giraffe staff!,I can't say enough about this hotel.  It exceeded our expectations and then some.  I will definitely stay here again and recommend highly!  In fact| I haven't been on this site to review anything for a long time but made a point to sit down and do this now because they deserve another stellar review!  The staff--to a person--is friendly as heck and always willing to assist with anything.  The room was very spacious for a NYC hotel and had a lovely bed and everything one would need.  The hotel offers free breakfast in the morning and in the evening| they provide drinks and snacks--and not crappy ones either.  I love this hotel  and so did my cousin.  We now understand fully why it's rated so highly.  Kudos to the hotel staff!,
1,Amazing,Just took a great trip to downtown manhattan for my girls first trip to New York city - the Hotel Giraffe was great!  The staff was attentive| the balconies/rooftop bar have a beautiful view| and the location is prime!,
7,A wonderful experience,This hotel is the crack spot.  I will admit up front my bias against small no-name hotels| but let me explain.  My past experiences with small hotels (even the nice ones) has been that the amenities are sparse and service is sparing.  This place is different.  It actually feels like home| except for the fact that it's cleaner and the toilet is nicer.  It's amazingly small - the hallway on any given floor can't be more than 25 feet long.  The elevator always arrives when you beckon| so a jaunt to the lobby is hardly a thang.  And trust me| you will want to go to the lobby.   There is hotel-wide free internet| and the lobby is set up like a cozy coffee shop where people are always relaxing and reading the paper or cranking away on their laptops (very few Mac users though| which is…,
424,Best of Everything!,This was our second time here. We could live here if we had a short assignment in NY. They have everything to make it feel like home. Room was clean and well planned. Free bottled water. Free breakfast in the lobby| and FREE wine and cheese at 5 pm! Our new go to.  Kudos to Amanda| Ashley and Alex (breakfast and wine attendant?)This was our second visit| but not our last| I hope!,
2,Retired traveler,Good service checking in and out and parking Making your room is not automatic. call the front desk and they will do it. Technical service to help with TV was quick. The breakfast and service is very good (free) Happy hour is excellent (free),
5,Great Stay,We've stayed at quite a few hotels in NYC and so far| this one is the best.  Location great for Union Square| Macy's| Times Square and Grand Central.  I'm a big coffee drinker| so coffee available 24/7 was terrific.   Also| bottled water available on rooftop.  Rooms large and very clean.  Staff wonderful.  My daughter is gluten free| so the location of Little Beet right down the street was perfect for us.  Hotel also serves gluten free bagels and toast.  Free breakfast every morning was available.  Clean and well put out.  Pastries| coffee| yogurt| toast| bagels| hard boil eggs| and fruit.  Would recommend Giraffe to everyone and will definitely be back.,
9,Would return,Hotel had wonderful Service and Amenities. Staff was very courteous| and helpful| and our rooms were very nice. Great location. Good value. We would return if we had the opportunity and recommend this hotel to others.,
425,Perfect for a family and great location!,We stayed here for 6 nights recently in a king balcony suite. My teenage daughter slept comfortably on the pull-out couch while me and my husband enjoyed the spacious corner king bedroom. The size of the room was perfect for us and we enjoyed the sunsets with the balcony door open. There is a motorized wall switch to lower a black-out curtain for the balcony door so this helped to reduce incoming light when we slept. The bathroom is a bit small with only 1 sink but it's got LOTS of counter space and under cabinet storage allowing us to easily unpack and access our toiletries.There is a refrigerator/bar area which was stocked with bottled water| a complimentary bottle of red wine| wine opener| and glasses. There is no ice available in the hall| but the front desk will bring ice…,
3,Great experience,Upgraded to King Suite!  Enjoyed complimentary breakfast| all day coffee tea cappachino.   Also all day for  pepperidge farm  cookies and danish.    It was raining and they have complimentary umbrellas to use. Great location!,
22,Great Stay Again,We have stayed at the Giraffe several times over the years.  We keep coming back because we have always enjoyed our stay at this hotel and even when reservations seem problematic the management always seems to be able to work something out.  I dealt several times by email and phone with Ashley Van G one of the sales and marketing persons at the hotel so as to put together a weekend with one change of rooms over the July 1 to 4 weekend| which also included a time extension for a modest fee on our last day so as to accommodate late flights out of the City.  Her service was timely and exceptional when I think of dealing with other hotels that do not respond well to requests that are unusual but particular to your stay. It is a people friendly hotel where the persons working on the…,
34,Lovely hotel BUT......,Been recommended this hotel so decided to book through Bookings.com...mistake! Email confirmation gave final price but upon booking they added another 700 dollars without warning New York tax plus over 400 dollars for a deposit on the room. Would have happily paid it if been told but was not| just asked to pass over card for authorisation| not once did anyone tell me how much they were about to instantly debit off my card. Although apologetic| they could not rectify the situation and agreed that i should have been informed of the price...not a good start after a long flight and feeling extremely tired! i was given wine and cheese as an apology| but then got to room to find rooms keys didnt work and 2 hours later still werent rectified| by this stage i was not happy to say the…,
47,Our new home away from home in NYC,What a fantastic hotel!  Chose it because reviews stated it's family friendly- and it certainly is. Very reasonably priced suite| especially by New York standards. Well appointed and comfortable- but above all| CLEAN!   The staff is fantastic. The front desk staff is so knowledgeable and friendly. I have to take a moment to make a special note about Gabriela who works the bar area for breakfast and the evening wine and cheese. What a sweet| sweet lady- everyone seemed to love her| as did we. The breakfast and wine and cheese which are included in your stay| as well as round the clock refreshments (like espresso and cookies!) are so appreciated and all actually quite delicious.  The hotel is wonderfully located| as well. For families| it's good to note that Madison Park…,
31,A great stay in NYC,We already stayed at one hotel of the library collection (The Library) during a previous trip in NYC and this time we changed hotel and tried the Giraffe...we had a great experience: the same top quality service and another very convenient location.  Staff is very helpful and the wine and cheese is a great tradition!  We will certainly come back!,
29,We will stay again!,This hotel was clean| friendly and perfect spot for our vacation. The complimentary breakfast was perfect and the happy hour was a treat we looked forward to at the end of our day. We will most definitely stay again. ,
13,A wonderful oasis of comfort in NYC,We booked 5 rooms for a retirement party trip of 2 nights in NYC.  From start to finish| everything about the hotel's staff and operation were wonderful.  I simply can't say enough about how far Ashley Van Goehring (sales & marketing) went to ensure we had an experience to remember forever.   She is a great tribute to the success of this establishment.  Gabriella served continental breakfast in the morning| and wine & cheese in the evenings.   She was never without a smile on her face| and always offering to help.  The hotel's doorman (sorry| his name slips my mind) was very helpful and friendly at all times.   We felt a bit like royalty| being greeted warmly whenever we entered or left the building.  Hotel was immaculate| current and beautiful.   It was a genuine pleasure to…,
2,Hotel Giraffe,Really a wonderful hotel.  The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating| the rooms are larger than typical| and the neighborhood is wonderful.  It is quiet at night| lots to do nearby| and convenient to many things.  Lots of great details at the Giraffe  that made this a wonderful spot.,
3,Excellent,Staying at Hotel Giraffe was an amazing experience. Whether it was the staff at the front desk or the workers behind the bar the service was excellent and we found the information provided by the concierge extremely helpful. The complimentary continental breakfast and afternoon/evening snacks and wines were very satisfying and gave you a great chance to put your feet up and relax. Myself (21)| my brother (19) and my dad (56) all felt very welcome and befriended by the hotel staff and felt as if it were a home away from home. I highly recommend Hotel Giraffe to all and guarantee you'll enjoy your stay.   Special thanks to our concierge| Chris and all the guys who made our stay as easy and enjoyable as possible.,
1,Great| quiet location with balcony!,We had a great time at Hotel Giraffe. The concierge desk at check-in/out were very nice and helpful. The included breakfast was a great added benefit to our stay. The entire staff was very sweet. We will definitely be staying here again! Thank you!! ,
19,brilliant stay,Fantastic location for any sight seeing across nyc with easy access to 2 subway stations close by. All staff without exception were friendly| professional and knowledge. Always happy to help with any query. Room was spacious and quiet with the added lovliness of a small balcony. Bed was super comfy and nice touch of complimentary bottles of water each day.  Cheese and wine was excellent though only managed to make it one evening. Only thing that would make this superb hotel even better would be a bar which opened past 9pm for a night cap. Thanks hotel giraffe we will definitely return when we come back to nyc.,
907,Wonderful,One of the most wonderful hotels I have stayed in world wide Excellent position in New York| easy to get around the city on foot and by metro Extremely clean and well presented Rooms a good size All staff 10 out of 10 | polite and helpful Breakfast much more than I expected Wine and cheese every evening was brilliant and some one playing the piano every evening Coffee| tea| biscuits| cakes and fruit available 24/7 Where else would you find all the above for the price| in my opinion not many hotels,
1,Great hotel,What a fantastic hotel| a group of amazing helpful staff - front desk| doormen| breakfast staff| maids| conference staff.  Rooms are clean and quiet| superior linen.  Brilliant breakfast service| complimentary wine and cheese every evening. NOTHING too much trouble. Seriously a great hotel - I have stayed at a few hotels worldwide and will definitely be staying here again. HIGHLY recommended. Oh... and I bought one of their robes...never done that before.   ,
20,Midtown Pleasure| Hotel Giraffe,I had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Giraffe at the corner of Park Ave and 26th St recently. From the sweet gentleman at check in to the lovely clean room and the complimentary coffee/ tea | I could not be happier.  Our room had a balcony with a pot of geraniums on it ! What could be nicer?  There was a complimentary wine and cheese in the afternoon  with an excellent pianist and then complimentary continental breakfast in the morning.  I enjoyed everything they had to offer and will absolutely stay here again. Loved it!!,
5,Great hotel!,We were looking for a new hotel for our family that was centrally located but not in real midtown and was smaller that the larger chains...  Hotel Giraffe is the best!  Would recommend highly!  Plan on staying here overtime our family comes to town!,
2,an excellent place to stay while in NYC,The Giraffe Hotel is the first time we stayed in a Library Hotel.  It was a great experience and exceeded our expectations (which are always high).  The staff was attentive and friendly.  The room was clean and comfortable. The highlight was the breakfast and the breakfast staff.  We all commented on the quality of food and the efficiency and friendliness of  the breakfast staff. Management is doing something right.  It was a wonderful way to start the day.  WE all highly recommend this hotel.  ,
13,Hidden Treasure,This hotel was an amazing find.  Right on Park Ave.  I people watched from the balcony| had an amazing view. We stayed in a 1 br suite| it was large (especially for NYC) and very clean. Staff was extremely nice and helpful.  The rooftop bar was a bonus| as was the wine & cheese happy 3-hour!  Free snacks all day was great to grab and go before we left to explore NYC.  We didnt eat at the restaurant but we did go to the bar one night and the bartender was AMAZING.  We got to test one of his new drinks :) Close to the Madison Sq Park and Flatiron bldg.  So much to see and do| I would definitely stay again!!,
1,Serious Concern,I've stayed at the Hotel Giraffe a numcer of times and have always been very pleased and woulld have rated it Excellent. This time (June 24-26) | however| there seem to be a serious problem. After the night if the 25th| I discovered a number (18) of very itchy red spots on the left side of my right foot. Fortunately I was going home and had some cortisone cream there which I had to apply immediatey as the itch was so intense. I checked Goggle for bedbug bites and the first picture shows bites exactly like those on my foot. The itching has been reduced but the raised red bites are still very much here. You can imagine my concern as I am aware that bedbugs can be a problem in hotels. I think it would extremely prudent if your hotel would check out this situation to ascertain if…,
1,Almost perfect,Room large| nicely decorated&very comfortable. Shame we had to ask for  more towels| bathrobes@complimentary water to cover the 3 adults occupying the Room. This should have been checked&dealt with prior to our checking in. Our bed sheets had several tears in&the Bath needed resurfacing or replacing. Coffee maker should be a standard in the Room. Had to wait 24 hours for one. Desperate need for Bathroom facilities in or around Reception 24 hours per day and not just when the Restaurant is open.,
1,Great NYC hotel!,Wonderful staff and room! Made our girls weekend trip a relaxing and fun experience. The staff even helped with a special birthday surprise from someone who couldn't join the trip! Everyone was friendly and knowledgable. ,
8,Great Hotel,We stayed at The Giraffe for the 5th time and it was good as usual. Room was great| breakfast was excellent. The staff even made sure our car was moved to in front of the hotel on Sunday morning to avoid any problems due to the Pride parade. That was very thoughtful of the hotel. Our only issue was some noisy neighbors| but that wasn't the hotels fault.,
506,that personal touch makes all the difference,"welcome back| mr grenby! of course| the front desk would have a note on my registration that i had stayed here at the hotel last year. but then again| i hadn't told them my name yet. and a couple of days later: ""mr grenby| remember last year you told me about that little vegan sushi place on 14th street? and that if you weren't vegan| you could just pick up some meat or something else to to add to the meal? well| that's what i've been doing. it's a great little place. i just wanted to tell you."" that was a doorman/bellman| and it made me feel special all over again. i think most of us like to be remembered by name. you become a regular at a restaurant or store| and the proprietors get to know you. i think in a large| busy - sometimes impersonal - city like new york| this…",
4,Perfection,I first stayed at the Hotel Giraffe in 2005 - and it's just as good as ever.  I've traveled all over the world but the attention to detail and the incredible staff make this an all-time favorite.  If you can afford it| stay here.  The value is incomparable: spotless| comfortable rooms| free water bottles| free continental breakfast with many choices including fresh fruit salad| bagels and hard-boiled eggs| free wine and cheese from 5-8pm - perfect for before the theatre| and a spectacular staff that always make you feel like a valued guest.  Close to subways| easy walking distance to Times Square or Greenwich Village.  If they have a room avalable| I'll always stay here.  You can save 20% by pre-paying.,
19,Great stay ,Just stayed at this hotel for 11 nights| great location| great staff (especially Gabriella at evening drink service )|  very comfortable room and beds. Rooftop balcony very pleasant also. Would definitely recommend this hotel. Breakfast included in price was very convenient.,
3,New York Awesomeness! ,My wife and I stayed at The Hotel Giraffe for three nights in June 2016. From the doorman| to the front desk staff| to the breakfast staff| we were impressed! The staff's professionalism and positive demeanors made our stay most enjoyable! The room was clean and tastefully decorated. We even had a balcony to observe the hustle and bustle of the New York City streets below! When we closed the balcony French doors| the room was quiet and relaxing| especially the bed! Thank you Hotel Giraffe for a great experience!,
1,Trip to New York,A visit to the city to visit our son and take in the sites. This was the 2nd stay for us at Giraffe and it was fantastic. Gracious hosts and helpful concierge service. The breakfast and wine bar are the perfect day to start the day and begin the night.,
1,Worth the money!,Fantastic staff - and very tolerant of a somewhat lost/ditzy visitor who lost her glasses and credit card (both found).  Great advice on restaurants in the area and other areas.  Free happy hours and breakfast much appreciated.  Also a (comparatively) relaxing neighborhood in NYC.,
61,Great find - highly recommended !,Excellent hotel with fantastic service and spacious rooms. Great find ! There is no in house gym but they have a partnership with a health club in the neighborhood which guests can use for free. This is not a trendy and fancy hotel like the ones you find in meatpacking district further south but it's a friendly business hotel with fantastic service unlike anything I have seen in the US (I mean the service).,
2,Excellent hotel and location,Could not have been happier with the hotel| staff| and location. This was a trip for my wife's 40th birthday and everything about hotel giraffe exceeded our expectations. We would not hesitate to return with our four year old!,
1,Highly recommend!,This hotel has lovely rooms| good size for NYC| very clean and stylish. The staff was exceptional! Location was convenient for our needs and it's a well lit and lively area without being exceedingly loud. We will definitely stay there again!,
4,Father's Day trip,"Location was perfect for getting anywhere| from walking to Flatiron building| Times Square| Theater district or taking the train to Brooklyn. The 6 and the R train stops are not far away.  The room was clean |comfortable| quiet and the bathroom was not cramped. Ask for a room on a higher floor.  Every staff member was very friendly| helpful and pleasant to deal with. Continential breakfast was well supplied. The auto expresso machine was easy to use.  I would highly recommend ""The Giraffe"" for any stay New York City ............",
7,Wonderful Hotel,The Staff could not have been better. The most incredible service!  We loved the facility: the size of the hotel| the chic but comfortable style| the suite with fold out sofa was perfect for our niece and finally the lobby and rooftop bar was something we looked forward to each day.,
35,Excellent Location| Ambience| and Value in Mid-town,I had an overnight stay on June 18-19| 2016. I was in room 603| which was a basic queen with a balcony overlooking W 26th St. The room was clean and spacious with great amenities. Recently updated with care. Breakfast in the lobby was plentiful and delicious. Happy hour was also wonderful with complimentary wine or prosecco and a selection of cheeses| crackers| and vegetables.  I can't rave enough about the helpful| friendly| and courteous staff. The staff were responsive and went out of their way to answer questions and provide what we needed with a very brief visit.  I would highly recommend staying here for business| with partners and friends| or for solo travel.,
45,Great place in a great location,I stay here for work quite often and you cannot beat the location and the experience provided by Hotel Giraffe. It is a top notch place and you will leave her feeling special and that you were treated the way you should be when staying at a hotel. It is located only a block from Madison Square Park| you are close to midtown as well as areas south. It is surrounded by excellent bars and restaurants. The hotel offers a wonderful experience away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The lobby is a peaceful retreat complete with piano| express/café| breakfast etc. It is a really nice place to just sit and take a break. The rooms are very comfortable and be sure to check out the rooftop patio if it's open. Super nice spot.,
12,Lovely Hotel,Great hotel. Well located| amazingly friendly and helpful staff. It's quite small by New York standards| so if you're there a few days you'll get chatting to people because the general feel of the hotel is so relaxed and friendly. Of course| the wine and cheese reception is also a bonus.,
169,lovely place,stayed only one night; but enough to state the Giraffe is a great place to stay when in NYC. staff very friendly| rooms well appointed. rooftop bar with nice views. really cool is the breakfast and the happy hour| serving some decent wines & cheeses. all included in your room rate and making the lobby of this hotel a vibrant place.,
130,Highly Recommend this Boutique Hotel,I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Hotel Giraffe for four nights.  I am already trying to figure out when I will be able to return!!  What a fabulous hotel property.  From check-in to check-out| the staff could not have been more helpful and pleasant.  Our room| the Classic Suite| was beautifully appointed| and quite comfortable.  One of the best parts of staying at the Hotel Giraffe| was the Continental Breakfast offered each morning| and the Wine and Cheese offered in the late afternoon. It was so nice not to have to leave the hotel each morning to find a restaurant for breakfast.  This hotel has a fabulous location| too.  Enjoyed the less frenzied atmosphere| that I experienced last time I was in New York City| and stayed closer to the Theater District.  Bottom…,
1,Top-Notch Place Found,Great place but too many people know about it now.  The popularity is driving the prices up too high on a regular basis.  A year ago| I could get better pricing.  He staff is fantastic - esoecially the people who provide the breakfast in the morning.  Make sure you get an inside room if you don't like NYC noise.,
61,Great place,Hotel/room amazing| The staff helpful & nice. I def would stay here again| they also have the continental breakfast and happy hour for the guests. It's not close to the theatre district but it's not a bad walk. Bring your walking shoes & see the city! ,
13,Brilliant Hotel,I spent 6 days at this lovely boutique hotel.  I was on the 11th floor and had an interesting view from my balcony. All the hotel staff were lovely| welcoming| kind and helpful.  The room was clean and bright with all the amenities you would need.  There was an amazing continental breakfast; tea and coffe and snacks available throughout the day and a wonderful cheese and wine feast every evening.  I would love to go back again sometime.  Worth every penny!,
2,Perfect ! 4 stars PLUS,Moved my daughter to her apartment in Kips Bay and this hotel was within perfect walking distance! 6 train and lots of really good dining options within walking distance too! Reserve 5 stars for Ritz and Peninsula,
6,I thought I already had a favorite hotel in NYC| but ...,... I do believe that my previous favorite has been displaced !  I travel to NYC a couple of times per year| and usually stay at The Library Hotel in Midtown.  For this trip| I decided to try The Library's sister hotel| Hotel Giraffe| and my expectations were exceeded.    The hotel itself is clean| modern and bright.  As other reviewers have noted| the staff is accommodating and responsive - the few requests that I made were met with 100% courtesy and zero attitude.    The rooms are not huge (this is Manhattan| after all| so expectation as to room size must be tempered)| but very clean and up to date| and certainly provided everything I needed.  And the room amenities -- complimentary bottled water| slippers| bathrobe| etc. -- add an upscale touch.    Because of the hotel…,
40,Home Sweet Home,This hotel was one of the finest places that we have stayed at....especially for New York City!  It was like everyone was family and the perks that they have are unmatched at any other hotel that we were at.  The rooftop is a warm| cozy place to go and relax and have a drink. The accommodations are wonderful and the staff is so friendly and polite.  We will definitely return to this hotel!!!,
13,My new favorite NYC hotel!,My stay at the Hotel Giraffe exceeded my expectations. The Gramercy location is terrific| with easy walks to Penn Station| Union Park and Washington Square. My room with queen bed was smallish but perfectly appointed with all the nice touches one might expect in a top rated hotel (robe| slippers| Q tips| bottled water) and one unexpected perk -- a complimentary bottle of wine! The rooftop is an inviting and well-appointed place to hang out| day or night.  The continental breakfast (including latte) and afternoon wine and cheese spread are included with the room and very enjoyable. Finally| everyone who served us -- whether at the front door| the reception desk| breakfast or cleaning our rooms -- could not have been more pleasant| courteous or accommodating. I look forward to my…,
13,Beautiful Property in an Excellent Location,We stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for 5 nights from check-in to check-out everything was perfect.  The rooms and public areas| of the property| are kept impeccably clean and very well maintained.  The service| from the entire staff| especially during breakfast and happy hour| was superb.  Besides the included breakfast and happy hour there was coffee| tea and snacks (fruit| cookies and pastries) available throughout the day.  Not just coffee but they also had a nice espresso machine available for espresso| cappuccinos etc.  Being in the Nomad/Flatiron district the hotel was central to everything and in a GREAT neighborhood!  The Hotel Giraffe is now our one and only choice when visiting New York.  We won't even be looking anywhere else.,
5,"Best ""Long Neck""",One long block from the park and two blocks to both the east and west side subway lines. Excellent continental breakfast and cheese happy hour included. Low traffic noise in rooms| comfortable beds and good bathrooms. We are regular guests.,
78,Wish I had spent more time there,"I have stayed at Hotel Giraffe a number of times| and it never disappoints. The lobby and rooms are lovely| but it is the service that I rave about. One time I was very late arriving. It was around 1:30 am when my car finally pulled up. The doorman greeted me by name and said| ""How nice it is to see you again."" That alone was enough to keep me coming back.   If you can| take advantage of the continental breakfast. I've never had time to stop| but it looks much better than the typical fare. They also have wine & cheese in the early evenings with live music.   Just writing about this place has made me decide I have to go again| and next time| take more time to enjoy this beautiful boutique hotel.",
2,Hotel Giraffe| New York,Just stayed in Hotel Giraffe for the second time. Hotel is in a great spot| right on Park Avenue| and within walking distance of most of central Manhattan. Rooms are reasonable size| very clean| with tasteful decor. Best part of the hotel package are the staff - all very friendly and helpful. Special word of praise for the team that runs the breakfast and cheese/wine service. Nothing is too much trouble| really was excellent customer service.,
1,Amazing respite,Hotel Giraffe| from start to finish| took extraordinary care of my family and I.  From early check-in to the fastest response on a maintenance call ever| to phenomenal breakfast service| the entire family had a fantastic experience.,
1,Great New York hotel,Best hotel I have stayed in for years.  Absolutely everything was great: room| staff| service and location. The breakfast provided was a welcome bonus.  If you are looking for a NY hotel| look no further!,
1,Great hotel,The rooms were beautiful and the service excellent. The air conditioning was effective but still quiet. The showers were powerful and the toiletries were top shelf. The only criticism I would have is the foam pillows were harder than I would have liked but I did not check to see if softer pillows were available.,
4,Perfect !,All is perfect at this little gem: central location| nice roof-top terrace| good size/equipment/decoration of the bedroom| complimentary breakfast| daily complimentary wine & cheese| all-day coffee/tea/biscuits offer but most of all the very friendly and efficient service of all hotel staff members. The only minor point is maybe the rather small size and slightly out-dated equipment of the bathroom| but that's me being very difficult. Really| I was truly impressed and would recommend this hotel to even the most demanding (business/leisure) traveller,
3,I have high standards and the Giraffe met them!,I booked two rooms| one suite and one queen for a family occasion in NYC. The hotel is near family who have also stayed at the Giraffe and recommended it. Lovely room| clean| slept well| extremely nice staff| and a very nice continental breakfast included. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,
27,Friendly staff| great location| excellent service,Stayed here for a few days while visiting NY. Was well rated and my experience matched other positive reviews. Excellent location - 10 min walk to Union Sq and across town to Penn Station. Very close to the subway (2 blocks away). Very friendly staff| efficient and helpful. Breakfast was good quality. Fast and reliable internet. Very comfortable bed and nice hot shower...all bases covered.,
4,Giraffe Hotel stay,I stay have stayed at the Giraffe Hotel almost once a month for over 10 years.  The rooms are very comfortable and the room rate includes breakfast plus wine and cheese in the evening.  But the BEST part about the Giraffe is the FANTASTIC staff and the service they provide.  I stay in hotels all over the world and the service at the Giraffe is the absolute best!,
162,Centrally located and the extras make it special,My now husband and I chose this hotels or our mini moon  after using Trip Advisor and looking at the excellent reviews. The hotel is situated on 26th street at the junction of Park Avenue South| so you are really central (approximately 10 minute walk to Times Square). On our arrival we were greeted by reception and given the key card to our room on the 10th floor (room 1007). The room was large with a decent sized bathroom comprising of a bath with a shower. The room had large built in wardrobes| mini bar (although this is empty but allows you to store your own drinks)| safe etc. Double patio doors opening onto a Juliette balcony overlooking Park Avenue South and most importantly during our trip due to the hot temperatures| good AC!   On the 12th floor is a large roof terrace…,
10,Totally Positive Experience,We stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for the first time with our two youngish children (6 and 8) for several nights and found our stay to be flawless. Staff was helpful and friendly without exception; room was spotless and comfortable| bathroom spacious| juliette balcony a nice touch. Breakfasts were a delight and we enjoyed the rooftop lounge on good-weather evenings. Our kids loved the place| too. Well-located for family sight-seeing.,
1,Hotel Giraffe-an excellent adress in New York City,We stayed in a very comfortable suite room.The room was big by New York standard except the bathroom which was small with the shower in the bathtub. The breakfast offered excellent coffee and a selection of toasted bagels. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.We will book the Giraffe hotel again next time!,
1,Unexpected Surprises,We chose this hotel because of proximity to Union Square and good reviews. Our stay exceeded expectations. A bottle of wine was waiting for us in our well appointed room.  French doors led to our own Juliette balcony that brought the outside in. Something not often found in the city. The continental breakfast and evening wine and cheese were beautifully presented In the pleasant lobby lounge. Service exceeded expectations. We will definitely return. ,
545,DELIGHTFUL BOUTIQUE HOTEL,We spent 3 nights at this lovely hotel in New York City. It was such welcoming hotel from the moment we arrived until we left| the Staff were fantastic and that makes the difference between a good and an excellent hotel in my opinion.  We had a lovely king sized bedroom with two comfy chairs plus a great bed and comfy pillows.  The continental breakfast each morning was fine and we loved the wine and cheese each afternoon.    We ate twice in the lovely Italian restaurant attached to the hotel. The second time we had the pasta and it was so delicious.  We were handy to so many places and if we weren't we usually walked| though a couple of times we caught a cab which are very reasonably priced.  We didn't get up to the rooftop as the weather was cold and windy unfortunately. Would…,
40,Heads Above the Rest,We really enjoyed our 5-night stay at Hotel Giraffe. Doormen are superb.   Our room was spacious (King suite) and spotless. Housekeeping always had the room cleaned while we were out and turndown performed while we were out| as well. Exceptional service from housekeeping!  The linens and toiletries are excellent. The feather pillows are too small| though. The only quibble I have with the room is that the bedroom| bathroom and closet doors all open into each other| resulting in an awkward and inconvenient design. They are beautiful| though.   The included breakfast is super convenient and much appreciated. The evening wine reception is an added treat.   Location is in a quiet and less hectic part of the city but still convenient to most popular locations. We can't wait to return!,
8,Great hotel,We stayed in this hotel at the end of April and we loved it. Warm welcome| fantastic room on the 12th floor and great location. We had a lovely balcony looking straight out to Madison square park| and where we could watch the comings and goings on the street below. The room itself was very clean and comfortable| a perfect place to relax after a day sight seeing in the city. The staff were extremely helpful and always had a smile for you. If we come back to New York again (and we hope to)| we will definitely be staying in the Hotel Giraffe again.,
2,Paul in NYC,Great staff especially maids and doormen also the excellent service with the breakfast and evening wine and cheese staff. They are friendly attentive and genuine in their interests. Great location near Madison Park,
3,The lovely hotel giraffe,Wonderful! lovely! so accommodating! anything you want the hotel giraffe staff tries to do it for you  And the rooms are so very comfortable! and amenities are perfect! And the afternoon treats and drinks! And continental breakfast included! Oh and the rooftop!,
10,Great hotel in NYC,The friendly staff| comfortable bed| generous room size| lovely bath with great shower made for a perfect stay.  The wine and cheese reception was a nice start to the evening| and the hotel's location was convenient for walking to many areas of the city.,
22,Delightful and friendly,We haven't stayed in an hotel in NYC in 30 years| always staying at my husband's club. This year| they didn't have room for us and now we'll have great trouble going back.  We loved the Hotel Giraffe.  Our room was spacious (for NYC) and had a very comfortable bed. The staff was very warm and welcoming. Breakfast was fast and cheerful with lots of coffee refills.  Never made happy hour| but would stay there again in a heartbeat. Lots of excellent restaurants nearby as well.  Short commute to the subway.  What's not to like?,
26,Lovely hotel| staff and little touches| fantastic location,Lovely friendly| professional staff| beautiful clean hotel and an excellent complimentary continental breakfast| not to mention complimentary cheese and wine (even Prosecco) on offer every night. They do not need to offer these extra touches but it really makes this hotel stand out that they make the effort to. This was our treat hotel at the start of our honeymoon and it did not disappoint. Excellent stay in a perfect location to explore NYC,
225,Feels like home - very good choice,We have stayed at this hotel twice during our US/Canada trip and were very happy with our choice. First time we had a suite on 11th floor facing the 26th street. The kingsize bed was very comfortable and our daughter had the big sofa sleeper for herself. The room was also very clean. For our last three days we stayed again in this hotel| this time 11th floor at the corner and with balcony. This suite was even better and we enjoyed our stay there very much. I should not forget how much we liked the 24hour open coffee machine (very good coffee!)| the lovely late afternoon cheese| snacks & wine and the breakfast that was included. It was really like coming home every day and the staff was outstanding and very friendly. We can also very much recommend the Bread & Tulips next door.…,
12,Charming and homely,We stayed here for five nights in May. We chose the hotel because we had enjoyed the experience at The Library five years ago. This hotel is a little less expensive but every bit as delightful. The rooms are comfortable| the front desk staff and bellboys| especially Cody and Lewis| were  always helpful.  The atmosphere in the lobby at breakfast and  happy hour is the great charm of this hotel. the service from Laura| Gabriela and their helpers was flawless and friendly without being intrusive. They quickly learnt each guest's preference for breakfast and drinks and managed to be swift as well and personal. The hotel's restaurant Bread and Tulips was terrific for the nights we were going out to the theatre - good food served quickly. We would thoroughly recommend this hotel and…,
1,Highlight of the hotels we stayed in,Lovely property where the staff were very accomodating and friendly. Room was lovely|rooftop bar funky and fun |even for us 50 to 60 year olds.Breakfast was a highlight as I have never had a warmer reception anywhere.  Overall a quirky hotel with charm and personality .Just a bit expensive |but that is New York I guess,
2,Best Hotel Experience During Our 2 Weeks in NYC,Hotel Giraffe exudes and embodies hospitality. Every member of the incredibly courteous staff -  hostesses (at breakfast and evening wine and cheese)  housekeeping| front desk and doorman are cheerfully helpful - Gabriella is especially thoughtful and energetic. The rooms are well-appointed and roomy as expected in a hotel of this caliber. The rooftop terrace is a really nice bonus. This will be where we will stay next time we're in New York.,
1,NYC Hospitality,Staff are most pleasant and helpful. Can't beat the Happy Hour or Breakfast options.  One unexplainable downside---no soda machines on the premises. When I need a Pepsi| it's an urgent matter. We love The Giraffe.,
83,Just a fine hotel!,I think the Giraffe has everything you might want in a great hotel. Extremely comfortable bed| easy work space| nice lighting| squeaky clean bathroom and nice amenities. The espresso machine in the lobby is a dream -- which makes the simple breakfast a pleasure. Of course the rates fluctuate. I received a great rate last week -- next week is not so great. ,
1,So close,The experience at Hotel Giraffe was essentially quite good but largely due to the staff - very friendly| courteous| and very helpful. The facilities were generally quite good as well with one glaring exception. We had reserved a Jr Suite. The room layout was cumbersome at best - bathroom| closet| hallway - configuration was difficult as doors kept banging into one another as you went in the bathroom or used the hall closet. While the bed was very nice| the furniture in the living room was virtually unusable. The sofa and chairs were very uncomfortable. We never used this room. So while we paid more for a larger room| we ended up relegated to using just the bedroom. ,
4,Another fabulous stay at Hotel Giraffe!!,I can't say enough about the place!! The people who work here are so sweet and friendly. The service is amazing. I was able to hang out on the rooftop terrace this time and that made it even more fun. This is the ONLY hotel I will stay in from now on!!,
4,Luxury Hotel,I love staying at this hotel. The staff is friendly| always greets you whether coming or going| and is in a convenient location for me. They offer breakfast| snacks throughout the day| and wine from 5-8 pm. I always highly recommend this hotel!,
1,Love The Giraffe!,All our trips to New York include a stay at the Hotel Giraffe. We love everything about this wonderful hotel! The entire staff is helpful and great. The breakfasts and tea times are delightful. The location is terrific. Can't say enough nice things about this hotel. Thanks again for making our stay such fun.,
8,Best Hotel in NYC,Once a year for the past 6 years I have stayed at the Giraffe| and I love it. The staff are very friendly and attentive; the location is perfect - walking distance from major attractions|  and the service is excellent.,
1,Great Hotel,Attentive staff| comfortable rooms| and wonderful complimentary breakfast. Have stayed there twice now and plan on staying again on my next trip to NYC. Also very convenient location - walking distance to Madison Square Park and many restaurants.,
3,Fantastic stay,We had a wonderful experience at Hotel Giraffe| and are planning a future visit to NYC so we can stay here again. The decor is beautiful and everything appears to be newly done. The room was comfortable| clean| and quiet. We added the romance package with the prosecco| chocolate covered strawberries and rose petals. We enjoyed the free breakfast and snacks and had a drink at the rooftop bar. The hotel is well located| the staff was friendly and extremely helplful. We couldn't be more pleased.,
386,Chic hotel with a great location!,I stayed at the Library Hotel last year and had such a wonderful experience that I wanted to check out the Giraffe Hotel this time around. I'm so glad it was great.  The location is perfect! Very convenient for exploring lower Manhattan. The lobby is elegant and the staff was wonderful.  The suite was spacious and comfortable. Everything was immaculate. The wine and cheese reception in the evening was excellent as was the breakfast in the morning.  I highly recommend this hotel along with its sister| the Library Hotel.,
82,What a gem of a hotel in a great location ,This was our 4th visit to NYC & 1st time staying here. We found it much| much nicer than the big hotels we'd stayed at before. Great location| nice foyer area| lovely quiet rooms with a balcony & best of all| their rooftop terrace - such a nice way to start your evening or take a bit of time out through the day. We thoroughly recommend it.,
13,Outstanding hotel| great location| great staff,I have stayed in quite a few places in NY - Hotel Giraffe is among the very best. The rooms are lovely| the staff are friendly and helpful| the breakfast is plentiful and nutritious with lots of fresh fruit| and the complimentary wine & cheese is a real treat. The late check-out is an added bonus. The location of this hotel is great with easy access up- or down-town. I am in NY often and look forward to my return to Hotel Giraffe!,
116,Perfect for a New York Tour,Efficiently run hotel at a reasonable price.  Perfect location for exploring lower Manhattan. Rooms are well appointed with free fast wi fi. Staff were all very hospitable and friendly. Good breakfast serve in the foyer. Tea| coffee| cold drink and cakes on offer all day. Nice touch. Cheese and wine into the pm. Would return. On-line booking system needs to be improved. Way over elaborate.,
7,Hotel Giraffe is the place to stay in New York City!,Stayed for a business trip and will absolutely continue to come here for business and pleasure. The staff was fabulous and very accommodating. Will recommend this hotel to everyone! And thank you for the champagne! Definitely put the cherry on top! :),
12,My new go to hotel in NYC,I have found my new home away from home when visiting NYC.  I come to the city fairly often and finding the right mix of location| price and amenities is not easy even in a city of vast choices.  The Hotel Giraffe however| was perfect in every way. I found the hotel here on trip advisor and was  amazed at all the wonderful reviews with not a bad one in sight and I have to say they were all spot on. First off everyone on the staff was fantastic| so friendly and eager to help in any way possible| the rooms were extremely spacious compared to NY standards and the balcony was such a bonus and definitely a rarity in a Manhattan hotel room.  On top of that| the plentiful breakfast and a happy hour with entertainment are included daily which was a wonderful perk| and the list goes on…,
61,A very well run hotel| with friendly| professional staff,We booked a suite through Expedia.  When we arrived they gave us a suite on a lower floor which had construction equipment outside the window.  When we asked to be moved| the management handled it extremely professionally| moving us to another room after the first night| sending a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates| as well as a personal note.  A testament to a well run hotel.  Breakfast and happy hour are served on the ground floor in an area within the lobby.  Breakfast is a European style breakfast with cereal| baked goods| bagels| fruit| yogurt and hard boiled eggs.  There is a good selection for a light breakfast. They have a nice wine and cheese cocktail hour| and water| coffee and small treats available 24 hours.  Service is courteous and friendly.  The upper…,
37,Great stay| attentive staff,Love Hotel Giraffe for its boutique charm| courteous staff| terrific amenities and excellent location. What's more the inclusive breakfast and wine and cheese reception contribute an added value. Will continue to stay here on future trips to NYC.,
27,Great boutique hotel,Excellent well located boutique hotel. All Staff are professional and polite. Great continental breakfast to start the day included in the rate. Cheese and wine each evening and coffee and biscuits available all day. All house staff were excellent to deal with and the housekeeping staff did a great job of presenting the good sized rooms spotlessly clean and well equipped. The seating area at the reception was calm and relaxing and is a great place to relax after a day visiting NYC. We stayed for three nights in May 2016. Wifi was fast and reliable. Will visit again the next time we are in the city and will happily recommend to friends.,
10,Best Hotel I've stayed at here!!,"We have two adult ""kids"" living in the city so we visit with some frequency. Usually I pick a hotel based on price and location. I picked this hotel because it was in the right spot and was priced the best but no- it wasn't ""cheap"" This was money WELL SPENT and we will definitely be back. Great welcome| great room| spacious and well appointed. Complimentary wine and cheese in the evening and breakfast in the morning. Smiles everywhere and fantastic service. Gabriella in the bar was also at breakfast and we LOVED her! Book this place the next NYC weekend- you will not regret it!",
8,Perfect NY City Accommodation,The Giraffe is a centrally located hotel on E26th Street and Park Avenue.  The hotel is best characterised by the warm| efficient and friendly staff| well appointed rooms and proximity to the subway. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff| who seem to genuinely enjoy helping guests with their hotel and NYC tips. The hotel is clean| the rooms relatively spacious and the early evening drinks and canapés are a lovely touch.  A highly recommended hotel to stay in.,
1,Was surprised to find workmen outside my balcony upon walking in the morning,I have stayed in this hotel before and the staff and property are generally excellent. But paying a total of $641 for one night| and having to avoid construction workers outside my windowed door to balcony while showering and dressed in the morning seems not right. Surely such a situation warranted at least a warning| and a discount.,
17,Just Perfect - I wouldn't stay anywhere else,My husband and I and our best friends (all from Sydney) stayed at Hotel Giraffe and I think I can confidently speak for the four of us in stating that we feel very fortunate to have experienced such a fabulous hotel.  We were visiting NYC to celebrate my husband's birthday.  All the staff were wonderful and they couldn't have been more helpful and friendly.  From the moment we checked in until we sadly check out they never let us down.  Their professionalism is outstanding.    We started our day with a really good breakfast which is something that a lot of NYC hotels don't offer.   At the end of a busy day of sightseeing we were welcomed with happy hour consisting of lovely wines with a tasty selection of cheese and biscuits.  What a lovely way to relax after busy day.  Our room…,
144,Great time ,As always another wonderful stay. It is our home away from home. Great comfort with the happy hour and breakfast. The servers at breakfast and happy hour always get to know you. Becomes family. Rooms are comfortable. Clean and quiet. Great location.  ,
1,Cosy hotel,Really cosy hotel and very kind staff. The environment makes you feel at home. Good beds| clean rooms| healthy breakfast| very good service. Nice location with smoothie bar| swedish café and Mc Donalds at the same street. Great italian restaurant at the hotel.,
21,Excellent choice in NYC,Lovely hotel. Rooms are exceptional| nice breakfast and cocktail hour. Great service. Can't be beat in the city that never sleeps! 1 pm checkout later than most and very helpful.  God location near public transportation but less hectic area.,
168,Excellent stay,"Rooms are lovely and well appointed. The rooms are also very clean with comfortable beds. It's New York City| so we expect street noise| but we heard very little. The hotel must have good windows that block a lot of the sound. We loved the free breakfast. We also liked that hotel staff remembered us as returning guests. Upon arrival| the first greeting we received was from the bellman| who said ""Welcome back!"" It was nice to be remembered. The Hotel Giraffe took good care of us and we would definitely stay here again. ",
5,Quality boutique hotel in a good location for exploring Manhattan,We stayed for 4 nights and found everything to our satisfaction.  May be on the pricey side for some but you are paying for a quality hotel experience that includes a varied breakfast ensemble| 'nibbles' and drinks from 5PM to 8PM and a good sized comfortable and very clean room.  Staff are friendly and very helpful.  Could not find anything to fault in the service or the quality of the facilities.,
7,Excellent Choice,The service is perfect| the people is very friendly and helpful| the rooms are good| very cleans and also the bathrooms. All this| with a very good location| free internet and breakfast.  The rooftop is great and the wine and cheese in the afternoon are always welcome,
76,ALways easy,The Giraffe is our go to place to stay in NYC.  We book our friends there as well.  A nice intimate size hotel (88 rooms)| a great staff that gives very personal service| a good location and comfortable rooms.  The nice continental breakfast and happy hour are added bonuses.  A good value.,
1,Great Spot !,Been here probably 10 times...always love it| superb service and great / calming ambience. The rooms are always immaculate and the complimentary AM coffee / breakfast service + the wine /  cheese service every evening are wonderful touches,
33,Great boutique hotel,Returning to the Giraffe after trying some other hotels I felt like I had come home. It is the extras that make you feel like you are in a chic boutique hotel in Europe| such as the complimentary breakfast and the complimentary evening wine and cheese. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Moreover| the area around the hotel just gets better and better| with the opening of some excellent new restaurants in the area (Uplands is right across the street.),
2,179,Loved it,Everything one needs in the lovely Grammercy area.  We used it for business and mixed in family too. The location is ideal| the rooms are well kept| the service was excellent.  Free Wi-FI is such a small perk| but appreciated| considering how many 4-5* hotels still charge per day for it on top of higher prices. Very comfortable stay.
1,may at the giraffe,always a great stay.  the front desk staff| especially young Chris| are exceptional.  rooms are great and affordable| suggest a room with a balcony overlooking park ave.  theatre tickets were great| obtained thru the front desk.,
3,Excellent as always,We stay here a few times each year since it is do conveniently located when we visit our family in NYC.  The hotel deserves all of the excellent reviews it receives....it is in an excellent location| the rooms are generously sized| the staff are friendly and genuinely remember us from previous visits and the overall experience is very much like returning to visit close friends.    You could save money by staying at a cookie cutter chain hotel but the rooms will be tiny| you will not receive the extra touches and overall you would not receive the service that is provided here.  ,
39,An Oasis of elegance and excellent service in NYC,Second stay at the Hotel Giraffe and was as wonderful as our first stay. I love everything about the hotel| the decor| service |breakfast| wine and cheese at night| the room was quiet and the hotel is in a perfect location.,
2,Fun in the rain,Our room was spacious and elegant. The front desk people go out of their way to be helpful. The food and coffee machine in the lobby and the homey atmosphere made a very comfortable place to hang out. Zero negatives. We loved it. ,
1,Exquisite,If you want to go on a trip to NY and don't want to endure the insanity known as Times Square| then stay at the Hotel Giraffe.  I've stayed at many hotels in Manhattan and the service| quality of the rooms| and the friendly staff are exquisite.,
103,Enjoyable stay,Enjoyed a couple of nights stay here last month. The hotel is in a very good location with easy access to the main areas of the city. The rooms are of a good size| clean and with a nice little balcony. Every evening cheese and wine is served in reception. Nice touch after a day enjoying the sights.  A continental breakfast of fresh rolls and pastries as well as cold meats and fresh fruit is available in the reception area served by the lovely Gabriella. The staff are very helpful and pleasant. A lovely stay My only negative is that we asked the hotel to arrange a car to pick us up at the airport| unfortunately we had a 3 hour queue to get through passport control and when we did arrive at the hotel the driver wanted 200 more dollars due to having to wait for us. We spoke to the…,
5,Great hotel in an even greater location!,I have stayed at the Hotel Giraffe on a number of occasions and the standard of the hotel has remained the same every time| excellent! The hotel is always clean and extremely comfortable whilst the staff are courteous and very helpful.  Afternoon wine and cheese is a huge bonus between the hours of 5pm and 8pm every day.  The location is perfect with multiple great restaurants within two blocks.  Restaurants to note are Dos Caminos (Mexican a couple of doors down)| Belgian Beer Café (2 blocks away) and Ben & Jacks Steak House (2 blocks up and 2 blocks across).,
132,Perfect mini-break hotel in New York.,My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights at the end of April 2016.  We were thoroughly impressed with everything about this hotel; from the initial check-in (2 mins) through to check-out (20 seconds).  All of the staff were extremely friendly and professional. The room was spacious| well equipped and very comfortable.  Breakfast was of a high quality| and as per virtually every other Review we were impressed with the hospitality shown by Gabriella at the nightly cheese & wine gathering in the lobby. All very pleasant !  It's a well managed| well presented boutique hotel that is centrally located.  What's not to like ? ...... as they say !,
1,Short Stretch at the Giraffe,Very comfortable and spacious room with good amenities. Prefer a deeper bath but at least we didn't trip over the edge! Breakfast arrangements are fantastic and staff service was friendly and helpful. Bread and Tulips is a great restaurant as is Upland over the road and Dos Cominos around the corner. Will certainly recommend this hotel to others.,
12,Wonderful Hotel Stay in New York City,From arriving and feeling jet lagged| we were warmly welcomed by name| our rooms exceeded expectation as usually in NYC you get small pokey rooms| however| these rooms were large and plenty of space| very clean and lovely decor. Every evening there was complimentary wine and snacks| and the morning breakfast included in the room rate was more than plenty with fresh pastries and bagels too. Staff were all very friendly and helpful throughout our stay|  they were very knowledgable about local places and eateries and made bookings for restaurants and attraction painless. The hotel is in a great location near to Soho| Greenwich Village and 5th Ave.   .,
3,Great hotel in New York,Good size rooms which are quiet . Service from everyone was great and always friendly and helpful.There is a good choice at breakfast and we liked the wine and cheese in evening. Good location for getting to sights. Would recommend!,
215,Gem of a hotel in NYC,I am lucky enough to have stayed in many different hotels in New York on business but this time our vacation needs were different. After my husband and I decided to bring our toddler for the first time we looked on Trip Advisor for suitable properties which offered a suite with a door between the bedroom and sitting area. Seems like not a big request but actually most suites we looked up are open plan. After seeing the amazing reviews for Hotel Giraffe we booked a balcony king suite and were not disappointed. The room offered both a generous living and bedroom space with space between the two| and a bathroom with shower head over the bath. We arrived late and were delighted to find a bottle of prosecco chilling in an ice bucket. Not sure if this was because we missed the…,
2,Great hotel - friendly and welcoming,Brilliant location - friendly and welcoming staff - it is great to stay at the boutique Hotel Giraffe rather than one of the big impersonal chains.  Wine and cheese in the early evening was a really nice touch.,
1,Stay here if visiting New York! ,Hotel Giraffe is hands down the best boutique hotel I have stayed at. The staff were very professional and friendly| the rooms a great size and always clean. Each day included a buffet breakfast & happy hour with cheese platters & wine. Very central location also. Thankyou to all the staff for giving us an amazing experience during our stay. We loved NYC & will be back. Danielle,
5,Hotel Giraffe,The rooms are nice.  The service is excellent.  The complementary 5-8 pm wine and cheese is terrific as is the complementary continental breakfast.  It's worth the money.  We've stayed there before and will again in the future.,
17,Jewel of Park Avenue,For some strange reason| this hotel get's overlooked.  I think it's one of the best in New York.  The location is ideal between Flatiron| Nomad| Midtown| East Village| the rooms are spacious| clean and modern| the windows are floor to ceiling offering great light.  I would stay here over the Nomad any day.  This is a real un-discovered Jem,
2,Very good stay,This was my second stay at The Giraffe and I liked it just as much as the first time. The rooms are clean and are of decent size for NYC.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  Breakfast is really good and they make great coffee!,
142,Another excellent stay,Having stayed once before and enjoyed the room at the Giraffe | we were looking forward to staying again. We weren't disappointed. The hotel is well located and away from midtown. Times Sq is a twenty minute walk away so not far. We stayed in a suite | which was fantastic. The bed is ultra comfortable. Road noise was acceptable | it's NYC and this is an inevitable issue everywhere . Linens are of the highest quality . Amenities included a music system| Cable Tv etc . Tea and coffee makers are available and drinks are available 24 hrs in the lobby . That also doubles up as the area for the wine reception in the evening . That was great| with a choice of an excellent white | red or prosecco. There are some nice crudités and cheeses available . Breakfast is in same place and again|…,
2,Excellent Hotel,Great hotel in every way.  A little pricey but everything is pricey in NY.  If you are looking for a great hotel in the heart of Manhattan| you won't go wrong staying here.  Beautiful rooms and the service was second to none.,
7,Wonderful hotel!!,This hotel is perfect. Very clean| great customer service. The wine and cheese| fruit| etc. from 5-8 was wonderful. A group of 8 of stayed there for 2 hours chatting| and the bartender made sure our wine glasses were full before she left at 8pm.  Breakfast included cereals| pastries| hardboiled eggs| fruit| and wondeful lattes and cappuccinos.  The room I stayed in was somewhat small| but because it had french doors and a balcony appeared bigger. Great stay!.  Try for a high floor if you are noise sensitive.,
78,Great suite with balcony,Aside from somewhat dated furnishings| this is a great hotel. King suite with balcony is reasonable| very clean| and the entire hotel offers a really nice experience. Wine and cheese hours plus a first class continental breakfast seals the deal.  Location is perfect| a few blocks from the square| a block from the 4/6 train.  You get a lot of comfortable room for a fair price too.  Hope they refurbish and update soon.,
171,Return visit,It was great to be back at the Giraffe - lovely that some of the staff remembered us - made us feel at home straight away. Everything was perfect - we struggled to think of anything that could have been better - so well done the Giraffe . Feel that Gabriela deserves a mention - she does such an excellent job with the cheese and wine ( and breakfast too on the odd occasion) she is certainly an asset for the hotel. Should we be lucky enough to return to NYC we would only book the Giraffe. The location is excellent - reasonably quiet but loads to see and do and a pleasure to return to after a day out exploring the City. we had a king suite which for NY standards was huge and we loved it. ,
453,Second Stay As Good As The First,Stayed here for a week and enjoyed it as much as the first trip.  The lobby with tables and sofas is a great place to get out of your room and get some work done.  All day there is fruit out and cookies as well as coffee| espresso| lattes| cappuccino and tea.  Nice breakfast spread included in there ate and very nice wine and cheese.  Surrounding streets can get noisy and car alarms go off and it would be nice if the windows were thicker to keep out the noise but I have found this lacking at much more expensive hotels and at this price point one really can't expect it.  Best I have found on my numerous trips to NYC for the money.  Will return.  Also Forcella a few doors down on Park Ave South has good food at decent prices.  Sit at the bar as the table service has never been…,
94,Excellent Choice,Wonderfull boutique hotel located in an excellent area.  Close to subway entrance| friendly staff| comfortable  breakfast in the lounge and a convenient Italian restaurant downstairs. Highly recommended.,
12,Great stay,Lovely little hotel| fantastic location| amazing service from extremely friendly & helpful staff. The continental breakfast was fresh and tasty. Wine & cheese reception was a highlight! Rooms are a good size and spotlessy clean.We decided to pay a bit more than usual to get a decent hotel and so glad we did. Only things that would make better would be a bar for a night cap. ,
1,Recent stay,Stayed recently in this hotel and found to to be excellent. The staff were really friendly and helpful| rooms spacious and spotless and a fantastic location. I loved the complimentary breakfast and the wine and cheese every evening. Rebooked for my next trip!,
2,Great stay for my parents at the Hotel Giraffe,I got my parents a two nights stay in NY as a present| once I ran out of Stace to have them in my apartment due to renovations. Not knowing much about hotels in NYC| I shopped around the area where I work| and despite seeing a couple of good.options| the giraffe hotel caught my attention due to its light| contemporary design and great location. It was certainly a great choice ! The price included a great breakfast and complimentary snacks all day| plus wine and cheese tasting everyday. The room they were put in was magnificent| so I really have only great recommendations about the hotel and it's staff.,
69,Well placed hotel with excellent facilities and staff,Hotel is well placed in mid town Manhattan easy access to line 4|5|6| at 23rd or 28th St and easy walk to key midtown sights. Rooms are spacious| comfortable and well equipped. Breakfast buffet has wide selection of  cereals| bagels pastries and fresh fruit . Beverages on tap 24/7 and the daily cheese and wine reception is not to be missed. All the Staff were always helpful and polite.  This is the 2nd time of visiting the hotel and having just returned I am looking forward to a return trip sometime. Was so busy this trip we did not get a  chance to try out roof top terrace.,
10,Perfect Family Boutique Hotel!,Hotel Giraffe really exceeded our expectations.  The rooms were spacious enough for my wife and two young boys and the beds super comfortable.  We loved the nightly wine and cheese in te lobby.  We picked this hotel based on their high ratings and I must say it lived up to the high ratings we saw on this web site.  ,
34,A good hotel,We had a pleasant stay in the Giraffe. Clean and tidy with friendly and professional staff. The maid service was excellent. The hotel had made a booking error which I don't think can happen too often.They dealt with the problem with great courtesy and we enjoyed two pleasant days staying there. Well located for shopping and for NYC in general.,
3,A Gem of a Hotel with a European Vibe,When searching for a hotel for a girls' getaway for me and my 11 year old daughter| I was directed to the Hotel Giraffe when the Hotel Elysee was booked. What a stroke of good luck. Just off 26th Street on Park Avenue South| it is a gem of a hotel with a lovely light-filled lobby (which doubles as a lounge)| spacious rooms| excellent service and a very professional and friendly staff. There is so much to love about this property. Everything was immaculate. The real plus is the hotel serves a fantastic continental breakfast and hosts an afternoon wine (and prosecco) and cheese reception -- all included in the rate. We actually planned our days so we could enjoy everything this charming and luxurious property had to offer. This was our first stay and I love it so much| I booked…,
1,Love the Hotel Giraffe,We've been staying at the Giraffe for years. It is like coming home now when we travel to N.Y. to visit our son who has lived there for ten years. The staff is wonderful| the size of the hotel is perfect| and the amenities are great. ,
140,Very nice but over priced,We stayed here at the end of our holidays.  The room had a balcony which was unusual for New York city hotels| but that was a plus.  There were other 'extras' like fluffy bath robes| water| tea and coffee facilities in the room.  We had a family room and it wasn't that large| but it was comfortable and quiet.  The reception was outstanding| arranged a car and gave us advice about where to eat| they were very efficient.  Breakfast was good| but only a few things of each out at a time due to space restrictions so often you were waiting for the staff to refill things.  It was very nice| but for over $1|000 for 2 nights for the 4 of us seems a bit excessive.,
2,New York adventure,This hotel| the location| the staff and the atmosphere was 1st class from the lovely breakfast to the wine and chees arvos with everything in between our stay was made even more enjoyable. Thanks to all the staff,
69,Short Notice great service,Family emergency brought me to Manhattan. Booked at Giraffe then got in my car and drove five hours. When I arrived they knew me at the desk and welcomed me. Room was ready| clean| comfortable and well appointed. Breakfast was simple but perfect| and the staff at breakfast were incredibly nice.  Happy hour and evening snack was a nice treat.  I will come back again and again when I come to New York!,
2,Excellent hotel,This is an excellent hotel in a very prime| non-touristy area.  The rooms are stylishly furnished| clean and spacious (for NYC!).  Some of the rooms have balconies| which is really nice.  The lobby area is inviting and I really like the complimentary  'happy hour' every evening.  The staff is friendly without being overbearing.  It's my favorite hotel in NYC.,
17,Perfect three nights...,Really cannot fault this wonderful hotel...   Great location| gorgeous balcony suite| staff who were attentive without being overbearing and a really relaxed vibe. The complimentary cheese and wine every evening was a great way to start the night!  Not cheap but worth every penny if you want to treat yourself. We will definitely be back when we visit NY again.  The photos show the view from our balcony...,
28,First Rate,We really liked the location of the property as it is convenient to the subway.  The property is in excellent condition and clearly well cared for.  We had a corner suite overlooking 26th and Park avenue with a small balcony that was perfect for our small family.  The staff really stands out and ranks with the best we have experienced anywhere.  I also appreciated not being nickel and dimed for stuff during our stay.  Wifi is free and we were not charged anything additional for our car despite the fact that we departed 28 hours after we arrived.,
8,Perfect hotel in perfect location,We loved staying here. Location was ideal...close to both uptown and downtown| east side and west. We loved our bright| spacious room| with lots of Windows and fantastic views of Park Ave South. Hotel staff were helpful and friendly and refreshments were available 24/7 in the lobby area. Breakfast was good| too.,
85,Superior Customer Service!,I had multiple conversation with a few of the staff before we even arrived. I was looking to order a cake for my husband's birthday| dinner reservations and room type advice. Each and every one of my concerns were handled meticulous. Every thing was perfect when we arrived. Breakfast was a pleasant surprise. The young ladies that were working the breakfast bar took multitasking to a new level. They were great. The room was clean and comfortable. We ran into the turn down maid when we returned from dinner. She was also very professional| entertaining and just wanted to please us. This is a great hotel and I hope to return again soon. I was very impressed with each and every staff member that we encountered.,
10,Gret location and reasonable price,"The Giraffe was the second hotel we stayed in during our visit to NYC.  The location is great with a Park Avenue South address and the rooms were much more spacious than our previous ""luxury"" hotel.  The staff was more than accommodating and held our bags as we were early checking in again.  The Giraffe seems to cater to the business traveler.  All in all| a very good experience. ",
27,We love this hotel!,We have stayed at many different hotels in New York City and now now exclusively stay here - the rooms are elegant and lovely| the staff welcoming and ever helpful| the location is fantastic- and the afternoon tea/wonderful breakfast just can't be beat! ,
44,A brief but restorative stay,A delayed flight made my stay even shorter than the one night I'd planned--only about 7 hours in all! My room was larger than many NYC hotel rooms and nicely appointed--with big windows and plenty of lamps and light; and the late night tea and cookies really hit the spot. Although I didn't have a chance to sample their evening wine-and- hors d'oeuvres offerings| I did have an ample breakfast| served by their very pleasant and helpful| attentive staff.  My only wish was that the lobby didn't double as the breakfast spot.,
3,Anniversary at the hotel giraffe,After 47 years of marriage we were treated royally at the Hotel Giraffe. The breakfast with sterling service and the all day snacks and tea/ coffee were enjoyed| plus wine And appetizers for 3 hours at night   Love the neighborhood with the Eataly and two parks close by. Times square and the theaters are a straight shot in the subway! Xo,
2,Excellent for families,Staff was super polite| rooms were excellent (1 BR) and very clean.  Breakfast in the morning and wine and cheese in the afternoon were a delight.  Location is great.  I'd recommend this hotel to family and friends - make sure to get a 1 bedroom if you're bringing kids.,
2,Magical place,We had the most wonderful stay. The staff were lovely and the hotel has a fantastic vibe| there's so many lovely little touches that make it a great place to stay. Everyone is so welcoming and helpful and can't do enough to make you feel well looked after. I never wanted to leave!,
1,Always happy to return to the Giraffe.,I have been going to the Giraffe for over 10 years. Small scale hotel| clean| ample rooms with high ceilings and large windows and balconies on a lot of the rooms. Efficient and cordial staff| I have seen the same friendly faces for years. Low key| casual upscale feeling. Love the 5:00 o'clock  free cocktails and munchies in the lounge and the rooftop terrace in the summer season. Love the suites when I can get one.,
3,A gem of a hotel in Manhattan,Spent 10 nights at this hotel and could not rate it higher. From the door person| the conceives| staff serving breakfast| all were just fantastic. It is a smallish hotel with personalised service. Rooms are a spacious size for New York. A bonus is the breakfast included in Tarif| as well as a generous 'happy hour ' with substantial snacks. Being able to make a coffee or tea at any time of day/ night is an added bonus. The lounge area| although small is cosy and extremely comfortable. The rooftop area| although not used | due to the cool weather| would be a fabulous place for a drink at the end of the day. Staff here were friendly| informative and extremely helpful. A great place to stay!,
21,Excellent value for money,Free (great) brekky| free cheese & wine and free wifi (in rooms aswell as the lobby). Absolutely nothing to complain about (except the room decor being slightly outdated| but the bed was really comfortable so who cares !) ,
3,Terrific Hotel| Nice Location,The staff was very friendly.  The room was spacious and comfortable.  The wine and cheese reception was very nice as was the breakfast.  We could walk to everywhere we were interested in visiting in a reasonable amount of time.  We will definitely stay here again.,
43,My favorite NYC hotel,Second time staying at the Hotel Giraffe| and once again| a great experience. Convenient location close to the Flatiron District where there are great restaurants and shops. Easy cab ride to Midtown or West Village. But most important - the staff and service at Hotel Giraffe is what makes this place unlike most other hotels in NYC. Everyone is pleasant - all of the time. Seriously. I know it's a small thing| but every time we arrived or departed| we were either greeted warmly or sent off with best wishes for that day's events. Amenities like the continental breakfast and wine and cheese in the evening are stellar services that also make the experience different from the big chain hotels. The turn down service with chocolate and soft classical music made us smile when we returned…,
24,Fantastic hotel,Stayed here with my friend for 4 nights. Friendly welcome upon arrival| attentive staff. Lewis was great. Room large and had everything. If you had forgotten any toiletries the hotel provided free of charge. Breakfast was ideal way to start your day. The waitresses even served you your coffee and toasted your bread| bagels etc. Tea and coffee with biscuits on tap during the day is perfect for popping back to from your shopping and sight seeing trips. To cap it all there is a cheese and wine event every day between 5 and 8 free to guests and starts your evening off well. There is even a pianist playing to relax you. This is our second visit to New York but our first to this hotel. We would definitely return to this hotel| a little gem in a big city. Friendly staff| clean and…,
27,A great little midtown spot,We don't like 'big' hotels; too generic| no personal touch etc. As such| the Giraffe was a really good find. Small| friendly & with some very nice additional touches such as complimentary breakfast| and cheese & wine every evening. Staff are really pleasant and welcoming - nothing too much trouble. As with all midtown hotels| it isn't quiet at night| but if like us you enjoy 'the sounds of the city'| then no problem (but it is worth requesting a higher floor room).   The rooms themselves are really well-appointed and very well kept. Location is great for walking| cabs and the subway (stations at 24th & 26th).  Absolutely ideal & we will certainly return here for future trips to NYC.,
13,A real gem in New York,Hotel Giraffe is a fantastic place to stay. We are big fans of boutique hotels| which have the intimacy| level of service and personal attention that you rarely find even at the marquee hotels. Discovering this in NYC was a great find on this trip. The staff here is first class. Whoever is hiring this group of people deserves a medal. Anything we needed was taken care of immediately by some of the nicest people I've come across in the hotel industry. The suite was perfect for the three of us. Very nice sized room| very comfortable beds and a nice bath. Great location on Park Ave| S. being walking distance to some word class restaurants. The wifi in the rooms is very good which crucial these days especially if you’re traveling with a teenager! The continental breakfast in the…,
5,Another Great Stay at Hotel Giraffe,We spent 4 nights / 5 days in New York over the Easter weekend.  Having previously stayed at the Giraffe in 2013 we did| very briefly| wonder if we stay elsewhere - but decided that we had such a great time before| why would we go anywhere else !!!!  Hotel Giraffe was as consistently excellent in all aspects as it was previously - the helpful reception staff| great room| and then the added extra's such as the cheese and wine and buffet breakfast.  we had a slight problem with our airport return transfer - which the hotel had booked for us - however this was dealt with appropriately in a professional and prompt manner.  We even bumped into some friends who were in NY for the weekend - where were they staying - Hotel Giraffe !!!   Thank you for another lovely stay - you'll not…,
19,Great location,My husband and I spent 5 days in New York and the Giraffe was the perfect place to stay. Our room was very comfortable and exactly what we needed. Little things like turning the bed down early evening & leaving chocolates was a nice rouch. The cheese and wine early evening sessions was an added bonus. The continental breakfast was extremely good| something for everyone's taste. All the staff were friendly and helpful. We would definitely recommend it and will return next time we come visiting!,
1,Great family break,Loved this hotel! First class service| really helpful staff and the cheese and wine after 5pm was a nice touch after walking the streets all day.......thank you Gabriella for filling my glass so attentively. This was a family holiday and we all enjoyed this hotel immensely. Midtown location was perfect. We like the fact it got straight to the point| no ornate receptions| no gym suites| no big fancy buffet breakfasts (just a very good continental breakfast )| you're just paying for nice rooms and great service. I don't ordinarily do trip advisor but thought on this occasion there was an obligation to the Giraffe staff to mark their service. Eric from Scotland. Social Kitchen hipster restaurant round the corner does great gourmet burgers.,
32,A awesome hotel in a awesome city,Giraffe has got good reviews and High rating and I would give it 6 in rating if possible .   First of all a wonderful| warm and friendly staff| AWESOME. Then there is the hotel| great breakfast| with what You need for a good start of the day. Great big rooms with incredible good beds. Fantastic nice tranquility oasis from the big city. Perfect location on 26:TH East . This is not a big design hotel| Its much more personal| we loved it!  Tip: if You want transfer from the AirPort and would have a good start to a good price use Gary phone: 212-961-6303.  He stand and Wait for You in the arrival area with a sign with Your name. A nice guy You can trust.,
216,Everything is great,This is a smaller boutique hotel| with more friendly personal service than the big chains.  The rooms are well insulated from the noise.  Nicely decorated and clean.  The location is wonderful.  I'll make it a regular stop when I need to be in this part of town.,
1,Great Stay,Staff friendly. Rooms great. Nice continental breakfast. Great location. Would stay here again. Missed the wine and cheese. Hope to catch next time. Easy check in and check out. Very quiet.  Would recommend to others. ,
12,Very nice respite in Gramercy!,"We visited this hotel on the coldest weekend of the year for NYC (Valentine's weekend) but it was well worth getting there.  The hotel staff were welcoming and gracious and gave us a bottle of wine when at 3:05 (check-in was at 3:00) our room wasn't ready.  The drinks and snacks in the lobby were a welcome treat as well as the wine and cheese hour which was generous.  We would have stayed longer at the ""happy hour"" if we had known how plentiful the snacks were that were offered.  The room was a mini-suite and much larger than other NYC hotels we have stayed in.  One of the best parts for us was the free passes to work out at New York Sports Club down the street.  We were on the 4th floor but the hotel is very quiet and relaxing.  We really enjoyed it!",
1,Lovely Hotel| Impeccable Service,Hotel Giraffe and their amazing staff are truly the crème de la crème. The greeting upon arrival was quite pleasant and attentive. J.R. was kind enough to put a rush order to allow us to get into our suite early. The staff in the lobby are very friendly and ready to provide snacks|drinks| even breakfast with a smile. Our King Suite was spacious and very tidy. Kudos to the housekeeping staff for their wonderful service throughout our stay. Turndown service with chocolates by the bed is a sweet touch after a long day in the city. We look forward to returning to this magnificent hotel. A must stay when visiting the city.,
1,Very Nice!,We really loved our stay here. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was simple and nice. The room was very comfortable. To top it off| this was a great part of Manhattan to stay in.,
4,An absolute gem!,We have just returned from a 7 night stay at this hotel and cannot speak highly enough of it!  This hotel is amazing and an ideal base for a stay in New York (28th Street Subway station is opposite the hotel).  I chose this hotel because it offered a complimentary breakfast plus complimentary cheese and wine between 5pm & 8pm.  The breakfast was plentiful with a good choice (cereal| toast| bagels| pastries| fruit) and it was lovely to come back from a long day out to a chilled glass of wine!  The room was clean| the bed comfortable and a range of items are offered to enhance your stay (ear plugs| feather pillows| coffee maker etc).  What makes this hotel so good though are the staff.  They are an absolute delight!  They are friendly and helpful| knowledgeable and nothing is too…,
424,Better than very good| close to OUTSTANDING,A few small errors we shared with management|  in this area of town| SUPER HIOTEL!  A free light breakfast and happy hour(s) are kind of part of the deal (continental breakfast plus wine and cheese nightly). Clean rooms with everything you'd ever need. People who seem to REALLY care.  You will not be disappointed wit a stay here - that is certain.,
54,Home away from home with flair,Upon arriving in January we were greeted by friendly staff who quickly had us checked in and in our room. They made sure we understood the breakfast routine and the wonderful offer of wine and cheese tasting each evening. What an amazing room| plenty of space| beautiful linen and furnishings| a bathroom well supplied with products. Each time we returned to the hotel we could help ourselves to free quality coffee| biscuits| ice water| all part of the price. Breakfast was lovely and fresh| and amazing front of house staff| so friendly and cheerful| always happy to assist with directions and recommendations of how to spend our time. The roof top is another great part of this hotel for a private outdoor space| with lovely music piped in. Just couldn't fault the hospitality of this…,
7,wonderful stay in nyc,the hotel is amazing. The staff have a knack for remembering who you are | and really treat you like family. The complimentary breakfast and the wine and cheese at nighttime is a nice touch. The hotel is amazingly quiet and clean. It really made you feel that you wanted to come home to again  and again . ,
6,Super fun| super cute,"We spent our ""minimoon"" at hotel giraffe this weekend. The facilities are lovely and representative of the pictures online. Everything about out stay was wonderful - hospitality of all staff| convenience of location (if you like the flat iron/union square/east side neighborhoods). Complimentary breakfast and happy hours were a huge bonus. Only thing I noticed that irked me was that| upon booking| the website asked the nature of our visit. There was a checkbox for ""honeymoon"" so I assumed the info would be in our records. When we checked in| I expected the staff to say *anything* indicating that they knew (i even arrived with a giant vase of flowers). I assume they didn't know| because they were extremely helpful| polite| and hospitable otherwise during our entire visit. ",
13,sister get away,booked last minute on hotel tonight| lets start with front desk staff| excellent service and seem so happy and eager to please it was refreshing| as was the door man. I would deff return to this hotel next time in new York.,
1,Giraffe Stands Tall!,Excellent service in a European hotel atmosphere. A staff willing to help and provide top-level service. Excellent food. Nice location| convenient to GCT and Union Square Park. Will definitely stay there again.,
1,Great place to stay in NYC!,Hotel was perfect for our family| the staff was very gracious and accommodating we even left items in the lobby and in our room and they shipped back to our house. We enjoyed the breakfast and happy hour. Everything was clean and neat| and quiet especially in our room with the pull out couch. I have slept on other pull outs in other hotels and this one was more comfortable then most! I would stay here again and recommend to friends.,
18,Comfortable and elegant surroundings,The staff at Hotel Giraffe were very helpful| helping us with reservations for an excellent restaurant and with advice on rush tickets for two musicals  Service was seamless and we enjoyed the delightful breakfasts and happy hours.  The location was perfect.,
2,A home in New York City,The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  The decor is understated and luxe| The beds and sheets are the best! Retreating to the Hotel Giraffe after a day in crowds and noise was restful and home-like.  The complimentary breakfast| wine and cheese and midnight cookies were much appreciated.  The location is also good and made most parts of the city easily accessible.  I have stayed in excellent hotels in much of the world| and Hotel Giraffe can compete with the best.  The only thing missing is full-service room service for when you have been too busy to eat or get late night cravings.,
15,Mother-daughter trip to NYC,This was our first stay at the Giraffe| but we will be back! The hotel is in a great location: we walked to Washington Square Park and the Highline in Chelsea| subway stations are right down the street| there is a great food market called Eataly really close by and you can almost see shake shack in Madison Sq Park from the hotel. The hotel itself is lovely| very pretty and comfortably classy. We were upgraded to a suite and it was beautiful. It was large| had a great balcony looking over Park Ave and was extremely clean and well kept. You are in NYC| so expect some street noise. It didn't bother us at all| but I saw that the hotel made ear plugs| etc.| available for folks who are disturbed by city noise. Housekeeping pulls all the shades for you when they turn down the room-a…,
28,Gracious and inviting,Exemplary staff| from front desk to breakfast server| my stay was most cordial and comfortable. Settling into the light and bright lobby with the complimentary morning paper (NY Times| WSJ| etc.) along with a cappucino from the breakfast bar was absolutely delightful and relaxing. I couldn't have asked for a better scenario. The room was large| impeccable| well lit (I LOVE dimmer switches -- have them all over my own apartment). Having complimentary robes is always a welcome  added comfort. Subway line nearby| Madison Square a block away and on a sunny day is a great place to have a sandwich and people watch. Loads of restaurants in the area. Cannot wait until I stay there again.,
10,A real gem in the heart of the city,"The Hotel Giraffe is real find as a place to stay in New York that is ideally located| well appointed| and reasonably priced. The staff is pleasant and smiley.  The rooms are generous for New York| and they don't have the ""used"" feel that many hotel rooms have| even the best ones. The bed was comfy and pillow selection amazing. Well organized bath with plenty of storage space for all your toiletries. Good shower. Coffee| tea| fruit and cookies are available all the time in the lobby. The continental breakfast is generous (warm hard boiled eggs and fruit and yogurt included)| and servers toast your bagel and bring it to your table.  They even had gluten free toast for me! Happy hour each evening is delightful and well attended| with red and white wines and Prosecco and cheese and…",
5,Quick business trip,This is a wonderful small  hotel. The staff is super friendly. The rooms are clean and the restaurant serves great  Italian food. Breakfast and cocktail reception are very nice touches. Would have given five stars but the TV didn't work and the laptop for printing boarding pass isn't very user-friendly.  I will make a point to stay here again.,
46,Birthday Celebration in NYC,Excellent! My friend and I spent 3 days in NYC| it is a yearly tradition. Due to her daughter moving out of the city| we were faced without a free place to stay| we knew we didn't want a regular hotel room| so I searched for boutique hotels and found the Hotel Giraffe. It was perfect for our trip - the complimentary afternoon wine/cheese and complimentary continental breakfast were a nice beginning and end to the day. Service was exceptional and they responded very quickly when we had a (minor) problem opening the fold out couch. Looking forward to next year!,
1,Great Stay,Great employees who make you feel like you are staying at their house rather than a hotel. The room| the breakfast and happy hour each day was a very relaxing and convenient service of the hotel. I would recommend this property to anyone staying in the Mid town area for any reason. Business or pleasure.  ,
2,EXCELLENT,They never disappoint.  The hotel is always clean| the employees are very pleasant and I feel safe and comfortable here.  The rooms are nice| always clean and inviting.  I love the location.  I'm only a few blocks from my office.  There are numerous restaurants  within walking distance but if you don't feel like eating out its nice to have wine| fruit and cheese in the hotel lobby.  The breakfast is also very nice.  A must place to check out the next time you come to NY.,
2,Great Hotel,What a fantastic hotel.  Yes it is not the cheapest but the location is excellent and the service is A1. Complimentary Wine and cheese every evening and a good Coffee machine| pastries and biscuits in the foyer 24/7.,
17,Can't wait to go back!,Stayed here with my sister after a few  days in an other hotel and we thought we died and went to heaven! This place was such gem| they did everything right. Staff was friendly and and always smiling| the bed was so comfortable we didn't want to get up| and the place was clean and very nicely decorated.  The wine and cheese didn't hurt either.  I accidentally left my coat and when I called they immediately knew who I was and had it at the desk and mailed it to me the next day. Service was spot on. Will definitely be back even if it's just to stay for no reason. Loved it.!!!,
141,Superb service and location,The minute we arrived| the valet and front desk immediately took care of getting us settled. Even though our room was not ready| they invited us to enjoy the brunch that was still going on and whatever else we needed. The rooms offered plenty of storage space. The breakfast was a great start before we hit the streets of NYC. The location was great. We walked a lot| but the subway stations were easy to find. My family lives in NYC| but my husband and I prefer to get a hotel. We've never stayed at the same place twice| but we will definitely be back here!,
5,Great Stay!,Hotel Giraffe has a brilliant location| within walking distance of the Flatiron building and Empire State amongst others. Therefore it makes a great base for really getting to grips with NYC.   The rooms are clean| the beds big and comfortable! Very nice breakfast in the mornings| and tea/wine in the early evening which is rare (apparently). Would definitely return!,
1,Fantastic !!,The staff could not have been more courteous - an absolutely incredible experience. The room was spot and spacious. The lobby/common area was a very comfortable place to relax. Location was convenient to many great locations. Can't wait to return.  ,
1,Wonderful Hotel,Beautiful and clean hotel with the friendliest| most helpful staff. Continental breakfast was great| I loved that they offer not just coffee but cappuccino as well. Centrally located which was a plus - not too far from Penn Station| very close to Gramercy Theater which is where we were headed.,
90,Good loaction,A very good base for exploring the city not to far from most attractions| lots of food places near by| room was a decent size| bed comfy good working bathroom| only bad side is its nosy but you are in New York so didn't expect it to be quite coming from London! ,
4,Hotel Giraffe,Fabulous stay once again.  As usual| perfect 2 night stay at our favorite boutique hotel in NYC! This is always our first choice when visiting our son. Rooms| though not huge| sparkling and lovely.  Friendly accommodating staff.  Late night snacks in the lobby such a nice touch.,
6,Hotel Giraffe,As we were checking in| the gentleman at the front desk informed us that we had just missed the wine and cheese hour. After asking my wine preference| he had a bottle sent to our room immediately and free of charge.  Great room with comfy bed and fluffy towels. Complimentary breakfast was fresh and top shelf. Staff was professional and helpful. Customer service of this kind is hard to find!,
230,Hard to fault central hotel,We have stayed here previously and will not hesitate to return as it ticks pretty much all the boxes which matter to us. Location is excellent for visiting both north and south Manhattan. It sits on a  north/south central axis and at 26th Street is is almost exactly half way between the financial district to the south and Central Park. It is about a 20 minute walk to Soho or MOMA. On the top floor of the building they have an attractive| if smallish| roof terrace. On the ground floor there is the main lounge area where breakfast is also served. This space also serves as a social point where in the evening you can enjoy complimentary wine and cheese. Our room was at a mid range price point and was smart and large enough to include a  desk and chair and comfortable easy chair and…,
1,Finally....,After numerous previous Manhattan disappointments in the hotel department| finally| an absolute gem. A flawless gem at that.  I can't report a single fault or shortcoming in any department. Hotel Giraffe is a very good| reasonably priced| stylish| understated and unpretentious| yet beautifully appointed boutique hotel located right in my favourite part of town.  The way this place exemplifies the prewar ambience of the neighbourhood (think Flatiron building| Empire State building etc) so seamlessly and effortlessly is amazing. Everything is thoughtfully done with wonderful attention to detail. Like the old books in the room about Alice B Toklas and Josephine Baker| like the complimentary upgrade of a town car to a stretch limo at the hotel's expense| like the high quality wine…,
116,Great hotel!,"I have stayed at some NYC luxury hotels--you can see my reviews on TA. This hotel is not luxury| nor does it advertise as such| but it is SO comfortable| friendly| spacious| clean| and nice! By ""luxury|"" I mean that it doesn't have the fancy soaps and shower and such--it's a bathtub/shower combo with a curtain--but it HAS a bathtub| which is hard to find in NYC. It doesn't have fancy linens| but it has a huge bed and VERY big room (much bigger than the Lowell| though the bathroom there was larger and fancier| and twice the size of the room in which we stayed at 1 Hotel Central Park). There are snacks in the lobby all day--water| cookies| muffins| scones| and a variety of fruits! And it's not snooty at all. They even ran to get ice when my mom came limping in from a fall. Free…",
1,Very satisfied,The hotel was clean| the rooms spacious and staff friendly and efficient. The amenities-such as the continental breakfast and the happy hour-were well done. Overall| a very pleasant and relaxing place to stay. The hotel restaurant was very good and the hotel is located very near a number of excellent restaurants. ,
5,Excellent hotel/Wonderful visit,Our family of 4 went on a trip for our daughters birthday. We chose Hotel Giraffe based on the online reviews.  We had a wonderful 3 night stay! Excellent customer service| all hotel employees were kind and always willing to help.  The room was beautiful| comfortable and very clean. (Cleanliness is a huge priority for me)  We enjoyed the continental breakfast and the evening wine & cheese service. It was also nice to be able to go down anytime and get a snack| like whole fresh fruit and bite-sized pastries.  We would definitely stay at Hotel Giraffe again.,
1,Favorite NYC hotel,Great staff| location| room| breakfast. High value. We intend to make this our NYC hotel - and over many years| we have tried MANY. And the evening wine and cheese was a real delight.  The rooms are surprisingly large| and wonderfully quiet| even on the 4th floor.  The lobby is inviting and relaxing.,
2,Best kept secret in New York. I never give a 5 out of 5 but in this case well deserved.,Staying at the Giraffe is like walking into the past when| service was a thing that was part of the experience. The ambience gives the feeling that everyone  from front desk to cleaning staff loves working there. It is so nice to come back and be remembered by name. I have never stayed at a hotel that I have felt so at home that I hated to leave. Thank you for a wonderful experience| the wonderful continental breakfast| happy hour at five and the papers on the coffee table waiting to be read (Patrick especially loves this).  ,
1,Girls NYC Getaway!,Amazing location| even more amazing service!  Before we arrived| Hotel Giraffe called to confirm our arrival and made our airport transportation arrangements.  When we arrived at the hotel| our transportation was more expensive than we anticipated.  Gaby immediately offered to credit our room bill for the difference in price.  The staff was exceptionally helpful| hospitable and knowledgeable in every way! We loved the wine and cheese reception each evening.  Gabriela was delightful! Our room was large by NYC standards (and had plenty of  mirrors - which is super important when you're traveling with 4 ladies!) I've stayed at the Casablanca as well and would highly recommend either hotel!  We loved every part of our NYC trip!,
8,Fabulous hotel!,We had a wonderful stay in NYC at Hotel Giraffe. The hotel was beautiful and very clean. Our room was very spacious and the terrace was such a treat. The staff were so friendly and very helpful. Very convent location. We will absolutely stay here again.,
4,Best Hotel in New York,I have stayed in many hotels in New York over the past 12 years. Many of them cost much more per night than the Giraffe but I have not found a more welcoming| accommodating| comfortable and convenient hotel in the entire city. I am usually here on business for four weeks a year but also when my family stayed last year for a week they all loved it too. If you want someone in a ridiculsoe uniform| up toght and pretentious go elsewhere| ther's plenty to choose from. If you want an amazing stay in a small hotel where every member of staff has a smile| there is only one choice. The free cheese and wine with a pianist in the lobby is great at the end of a busy day. The breakfast is adequate (let's be honest you're not going to starve in NY for the rest of the day). The rooftop bar is…,
64,Favorite NYC Boutique Hotel,Just had another great stay at Hotel Giraffe.  It has become my favorite spot for a getaway weekend in Manhattan.  There are a number of great restaurants nearby and several different subway lines are just a short walk away.  I booked a King Suite for two nights recently.  The first suite they put me in was on a low floor with little natural light| so I asked for a move| which they readily accommodated.  I ended up with a suite overlooking Park Avenue that was filled with sun.  Let me tell you what I love about this hotel.  The staff is friendly and customer oriented| from the reception desk| to the door man| to the folks manning the breakfast counter.  They really could not have been more helpful.  The suites are well laid out with all the amenities one could need.  I…,
39,Good enough!,Nice wine| cheese and piano player. Nice assorted breakfast all complimentary. I would stay here again but would make sure the bed size was truly a queen. The receptionist insisted they only have queen or king beds. I have slept on a queen bed every night for at least 27 years! That was not a queen! They were able to change the room to a handicapped King. Bed was great but the shower has no rim| for wheelchair access| so if you take a shower the bathroom floods!,
59,Lovely but ...,My husband and I spent one night at Hotel Giraffe for a quick getaway into NYC -- one of our favorite things to do. We try different hotels in different areas each time and heard wonderful things about this property. All of them true -- welcoming front desk staff| outstanding servers at tasty breakfast buffet and at wine & cheese time| clean and comfortable rooms (though smaller than I've experienced with more dated bathrooms). Location is interesting and certainly walkable (a mile or less) to many of the city's sites including empire state building and Times Square and theater district. The only reason it lacks an 'excellent' rating is that| despite all good| I was missing the small 'extra efforts' that we've experienced at some other hotels -- someone opening the street door…,
95,Brilliant breakfast buffet!,We enjoyed six nights in Hotel Giraffe over the Christmas holidays| and enjoyed our stay greatly.  The staff were welcoming and friendly.  We had a two bedroom suite| each room having a small balcony and a small interconnecting living space.   The bedrooms were spacious and the bedding comfortable.  The bathrooms well equipped (just a note that the bathroom doors had striped opaque glass panels| which was a bit weird – although you couldn’t be seen clearly| if somebody walked past they could see your figure on the toilet).  Everything was very clean and tidy.  A big bonus was the fantastic complimentary breakfast buffet served in the foyer/dining area each morning – coffee (such as latte| cappuccino etc)| tea| juice| fresh fruit| cereals| bagels| pastries etc.  The staff serving…,
3,Wonderful gem in the heart of NY Flatiron district,Great Hotel! Beds and linens were divine- had the best rest so that I had boundless energy to cover a lot of ground during my 4 day stay. Nice touches - like drinks |fruit and pastries always available. Staff very friendly. Only criticism is that the darned TV remote needs a college  degree to figure out- didn't have much time to watch tv anyway. Highly recommend this stylish and comfy hotel. Also| I thought the rates were pretty reasonable. Another note: I had originally  booked this through Expedia- but found the rates direct from the hotel were better - so I cancelled the Expedia booking,
7,NYC weekend,We visit NYC a lot to visit family and have stayed in many neighborhoods and hotels. Hotel Giraffe is one of our favorite hotels (great new restaurant Upland right across the street) since the neighborhood is close to metro and lots of restaurants. The hotel's staff especially ladies who work breakfast and wine and cheese hour are unbelievably pleasant and helpful. The staff couldn't be more friendly and efficient.,
10,Exceptional,Stayed in NYC 6/7 times| always usually 5* but this is the best hotel we've stayed at for the money. Stayed for 6 nights with a 7 year old and had a classic suite.   The room was spacious and very clean| the staff from front desk to maids were outstanding and the added extra of wine/snacks and complimentary breakfast were a bonus. Good location too....  I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting value for money but modern| comfortable| clean and with a touch of luxury. Will definitely be back again....,
12,Lovely personal boutique hotel,Placed in Mid town with easy access up and down| we loved the personal service offered by this hotel. All 4 of us ( 2 teens 2 adults) stayed in the double Queen room with balcony which was spacious with a generous sized bathroom. Wine and cheese from 5-8 was a nice touch,
4,Great Value!,Our family of 4 loved hotel giraffe. Great continental breakfast and cocktail hour that were hosted by friendly staff. Simple. Clean. Easy to Uber to Midtown at night and then nice to come back to our quiet room. Would recommend for a family looking for a quiet retreat at night.,
13,Grateful,I agree with others about the word getting out for this gem but the staff| facilities| decor and location are wonderful.  This was my second iMessage here and cannot wait to come back.  So grateful I have discovered a home while in NYC!,
1,Fabulous in every way,We celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary with family and friends during Christmas week in NYC and stayed at the Hotel Giraffe. Ashley was most helpful and patient in making the room arrangement for people who were arriving and departing on different dates!  The entire staff was excellent and more than once went the extra mile to make sure our stay was comfortable.  The breakfast| wine and cheese| newspapers in the lobby for guests| spacious and comfortable lobby| and ambiance and location all exceeded our very high expectations.,
4,Best kept secret!!!,I have to say| I am picky. I have been to New York several times and have never had such a wonderful experience as I did staying at this hotel! I cannot wait to go back! This hotel was wonderful! The location on Park and 26th was perfect for walking around. The lobby is so nice with someone playing the piano| complementary drinks| fruit| coffee and free breakfast every morning. Also| every evening at 5 PM| they have complimentary wine| beer| champagne and hors d'oeuvres. They even sent a bottle of wine to my room to say welcome. Water bottles are free| complimentary wifi is in rooms and lobby. Our room was big| especially by New York standards and had french doors with a balcony! Also| the bathrooms were big and really nice  and they had comfy robes and slippers in the rooms. No…,
289,Our new go to hotel in NYC!,This is our new favorite hotel.  It is a boutique hotel that is a true calm in the storm.  After a day of frenetic energy of being in the city| it's nice to come back to this hotel and enjoy their wine and cheese hour or to grab a coffee and read the paper in the morning before heading out.  I would like to give a special shout out to the lovely woman who serves the wine and cheese in the evening and I tried to make a mental note to remember her name.  Unfortunately it went right out of my head| but I'm sure anyone who's stayed here knows who I am talking about.  She is one of the hotel's best assets :).  But the ladies in the morning preparing the coffee are fabulous as well.  In fact| I think the entire staff is terrific.  Whatever you are doing| keep doing it.  Our daughter…,
6,Concierge Service,A special thanks to the Concierge Jonathan for exceptional service.  Made dinner reservations for Valentine's Day for us.  Had a great meal at K-Rico South American Steakhouse.  You really made this day special for us.,
6,Excellent Hotel,Almost hate to draw more attention to this little gem of a hotel.....but we had such an extraordinary experience| mostly due to the kindness of the staff| that I felt we should commend them for a job well done.  So the staff....Gabby at the front desk was just lovely.....our check in was swift and efficient after a long drive into NYC.  Our room was spacious and clean| beds were very comfortable with nice linens| bathrooms were also roomy....and it was surprisingly quiet.  The Hotel Giraffe offers a great breakfast as well as wine| cheese and snacks in the late afternoon/early evening.  I wish I had noted their names but there were two ladies tending to the breakfast and happy hour that could not have been more helpful...they were each equally friendly| engaging and…,
1,Fantastic,We stayed at the hotel giraffe for 9 nights to celebrate our honeymoon. The staff were more than helpful with local knowledge and advice. Also they were more than willing to bend over backwards for us| to ensure we enjoyed your stay.,
333,Great Hotel For our Vacation and Best Cost Value,We spend there 5 nights. Since we arrive in an early flight we asked to receive the room upon arrival and they did it| so we actually have full 6 marvelous days. Location is fabulous. Just walking distance from main lower Manhattan attractions. The staff is friendly| polite| enthusiastic to help and assist. What was published in their sites is actually happening! The breakfast and 5 Pm wine & cheese are very nice and helpful. They save you time and money. Room is functional and relatively spacious. We payed 1266$ for 5 days inc taxes and it was a bargain! Its Recommended!  ./,
820,little gem,The hotel is situated in a great location for visiting all of New York. Our room was quite big as we were told space was of a premium in the city. We had tea and coffee making facilities in the room and were given a choice of pillows on arrival which was a lovely touch. The bed was very comfortable and we had no issue with traffic noise. The bathroom was extra nice| very spacious with a great bath and power shower and premium toiletries. It has been mentioned in other reviews but the wine| cheese and biscuits was really nice| very good quality and well worth trying to fit in. Breakfast I thought was going to be a non event so we went out but the one day we decided to try it I was very pleasantly surprised| lots of choice| very fresh and well presented| Service in every aspect at…,
91,lovely hotel,I prefer to stay down near Chelsea as its quieter than midtown and closer to friends.  The staff at the Hotel Giraffe is very welcoming and friendly| and the hotel is very comfortable for a woman traveling alone.  A continental breakfast and evening wine and cheese hour is included.  ,
6,Wonderful stay at the Hotel Giraffe,My husband and I just returned from a weekend in NYC.  We chose the Hotel Giraffe really out of the blue| due to it's great reviews.  What a  lovely experience staying here.  We let the hotel know it was a special weekend and the next thing you know we were put in a suite.  Doors opened to balcony with fabulous view.  Staff very polite and helpful.  A great area to be in.   There is an Eataly close by for wonderful Italian take out items| and we enjoyed breakfast downstairs in the open and airy reception area.  Only suggestion is to change the music in the lobby to something more in keeping with the hotel atmosphere| which is very cool| upscale and clean.  We will definitely be staying here again.,
19,great service fashion week,had 3 adults and lots of wardrobe pieces. the staff new the time crunch we were under and very helpful in getting us to and from where we had to go. got an amazing rate somehow.  all featured services are deluxe|  will return again next visit. the only fault was that the textured glass panel insert on the bathroom doors is quite see through!! you can easily see whats going on...,
10,Lovely staff,A great hotel| good wifi| pleasant lobby.  The easy breakfast and free water was also nice.  But the staff is what made the experience.  Friendly| helpful| professional.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.  ,
3,I LOVE THIS HOTEL!,Hotel Giraffe is now my preferred hotel when staying in New York. With the amount we pay to stay at the hotel| I believe we receive so much in exchange. A beautiful lavish continental breakfast to begin the day including coffee| fruit| bagles and pastries and more. Then in the evening complimentary nibblies enough to be a small dinner as well as complimentary alcoholic beverages- what hotel does that? There is free cafe style coffee 24/7. The hotel itself has beautiful furnishings and a pianist who plays during cocktail hour.  The staff are amazingly friendly- and love to be of service to guests always ALWAYS with a smile.  Please do not think of this as a normal occurance- because it is not as someone who has had 2 lengthy stays at the hotel.  A random event meant that my…,
11,Perfect Stay,Another perfect stay at Hotel Giraffe-= the staff| room| happy hour| breakfast and location make a trip to NYC so very enjoyable. As a traveler I felt welcome and appreciated. Something that can be missing in larger city hotels. BRAVO HOTEL GIRAFFE!,
1,Wonderful Experience!,Hotel Giraffe was the perfect hotel for our New York trip. I loved being down the street from Madison Square Park and the subway station (and also the Shake Shack in the park| which we ate in their welcoming lobby because of the cold weather). Our King Suite was spectacular for how big a room can be in a Manhattan hotel. Service was superb and we love the complimentary breakfast and coffee/snacks all day in the lobby. Will go back if I ever need be in New York!,
39,Nice Boutique Hotel,I first heard about Hotel Giraffe through Trip Advisor and I have to agree with their reviews. It's an excellent intimate small hotel. The room was quiet| a great breakfast is included and the  downstairs lobby has a great self service coffee/cappuccino machine where you can indulge to your heart's content,
53,An oasis,Such a lovely location| super service with some lovely touches.  Suite was spacious and well equipped.  Helpful staff with great recommendations for local restaurants etc. Well worth a visit.  Cheese and wine in the early evening was an added pleasure.  Well done to all.,
4,Wonderful service,First time at this hotel. Room quiet| comfortable| bathroom lovely.  Neighborhood full of good restaurants--ethnic (Indian) within close proximity to subway.  Lovely breakfast with attentive service. Staff very responsive.,
2,Safe Haven in NYC,I stay at this hotel every January and I love it. The staff is fantastic and friendly. I feel like I am staying at a good friend's house because of all the amenities and graciousness of the staff. The dailey breakfast| wine| and snacks the hotel provides make the hotel cozy.,
46,Top new York hotel ,The hotel room was a much bigger then rooms at same priced  hotels.The staff went out of their way  to make stay a wonderful  as it could possibly  be.Service at breakfast and cheese evening was spot on.The cleanest hotel so far sister hotel was to same standard. Will be staying again when  in New York. Stayed  for seven  nights great hotel  for sight seeing .Would  of loved a bit more variety at breakfast but was a great standard.  Well done to all staff Gabrielle is a great member of the hotel  team. ,
1,Hotel Giraffe,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Giraffe for 3 nights as a combination business/personal vacation trip. The hotel was well known to me as I frequently traveled to NYC for business at found this gem of a hotel when working near Madison Square Park. The exemplary but not fussy service and overall ambiance of this hotel is as close to ""home away from home"" as a hotel could offer. The room accommodations were comfortable and elegant. We stayed on the 12 floor which is removed from street noise. We availed ourselves of the morning breakfast in the lobby which reminded us of the finer European hotels.",
3,all is well that ends well,the staff was most accommodating and the rooms were clean.  All was ready when we got there.  The wine and cheese at night was a nice touch along with the continental breakfast..  The front desk personnel were friendly and doubled as a concierge.,
1,Charming hotel with fantastic customer service!,"Hotel Giraffe is an adorable boutique hotel right on Park Ave. It offers charm| character and cleanliness. Loved the walk-out balcony! The staff are super friendly and accommodating as well. As a bonus| the couple who stayed in the room I had before me| left a bottle of champagne ""for the next guest"". What a pleasant surprise!! ",
15,Really nice mid-town hotel,We stayed here in January.  It's a nice well priced New York hotel.  It comes with continental breakfast and a wine hour in the afternoon| which is very practical. The rooms have reasonable space| and are nicely appointed.  Not a design hotel| or particularly glamorous| but very practical.  The staff are helpful and very friendly. The location is very practical| a short subway ride to the theatre district| or to downtown| or Brooklyn.  Overall a great place to stay.,
9,Birthday weekend,Came to the hotel to celebrate a birthday and had a wonderful time.  The staff was exceptionally accommodating. The room was large| well furnished and clean. The wine and cheese every evening is a wonderful touch.  It was a wonderful experience and we look forward to coming back again!,
57,Pleasant Visit,My wife and I recently stayed 3 nights at Hotel Giraffe.  The room was clean| and the staff was always willing to help.  The location worked very well for the events we attended.  The breakfast set-up was not user friendly| and was the only negative we experienced.  However| the evening wine and appetizers more than offset the minor breakfast inconveniences. They were tasty and plentiful with excellent service.  Also| our room was pleasantly| and surprisingly| quiet each night for sleeping.  I would be pleased to return to Hotel Giraffe on my next visit to NYC.,
2,Fantastic stay,I travel often for business and usually stay at Marriott's. I decided to try something new and this hotel knocked it out of the park! The rooms are clean| the bed is comfortable| the staff is friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend staying here for business or pleasure!,
2,Best service in town!,Hotel Giraffe provides not just a room but an experience. You will be greeted by bellhops and receptionists who seem genuinely happy that you showed up. Rooms are tastefully decorated| the beds comfy| the feel roomy and warm.  The lobby| strewn with couches| stuffed chairs| love seats| and tables invite you to relax and enjoy the excellent continental breakfast| the evening wine and cheese| or the all-day service of fruit| cookies| coffee| and tea. Servers are friendly| kind| and| heavens to betsy| patient! Be careful; it's so welcoming you might miss your dinner reservation.  Before I checked out| I stopped in the lobby for a few minutes for coffee. When I went to the desk| lo and behold| I had been recognized. My car had been retrieved (the valet service is excellent) and was…,
2,One of the Best,I've stayed in lots of hotels in NYC in recent years| and this was my best experience. Location| service| amenities--all were outstanding. I will certainly look to staying at the Hotel Giraffe again in the near future.,
16,A charmed weekend,We had a lovely over-night stay at the Giraffe Hotel. The location near Madison Park and in the Flatiron District is extremely nice. When we made the reservation they were kind enough to ask if we preferred an upper floor room when I asked about street noise. Actually the neighborhood seemed very quiet and as it turned out the front desk...in particular JR...went out of his way to make our stay a romantic and memorable one.  The service was very attentive| but in a casual rather than cloying way. The hotel has a very pleasing young-ish vibe| by which I mean not stuffy or overly formal| but as I've said| very accommodating  in every way. Particularly appreciated their regular 1:00 pm check-out time as well as their being unexpectedly able to accommodate us for a bit of an early…,
5,Hoter Giraffe Weekend Stay,Excellent from staff to amenities. Pastries| latte| wine and cheese. What I really like is the lobby is quiet and peaceful a great place to recharge between sight seeing trips. Many fine dining options in Flatiron. Eataly is just around the block and Dos Comnos is next door. Subway is close so it is easy to get to the village or central park and midtown is a short walk. This is my second stay and I plan to be back in the summer.,
11,Fabulous stay at the Hoteel Giraffe,We had a wonderful stay at the Hotel Giraffe.  First off it was immaculate.  We stayed in the King suite during hotel week.  We had a bedroom with a king bed & a full living room.  The couch has a sleeper in it but we did not use that.  For NYC it was a huge room.  The continental breakfast was extensive.  The wine & cheese also was extensive.  The waitress Gabrielle was friendly & remembered our orders the next night.  All of the staff was friendly & very helpful.  I have nothing but compliments for the staff.  We went in the winter but the roof top looked like it would be fun in warmer weather.  We had lunch the first day we arrived in the restaurant connected to the hotel.  I didn't save their card but I think it was bread & tulips - something like that.  It was a delicious &…,
11,Consistent Comfort at the Giraffe: Clean| warm and cozy a short walk from Union Square,When I make my own travel arrangements for work I choose the Giraffe if the price is within the Corporate limit. Unfortunately it is a more expensive option but well worth it for me for its consistency in cleanliness| comfort and good service. The bed is super comfortable| and the sink/vanity has plenty of space for your grooming gear. Great subtle themed decor. Good sound management from street/hallway/other guests. Elevators can get busy but this seems to be par for the course with hotels these days. Staff is lovely| especially the cleaning staff who make every effort not to disturb you. It is a joy to return from a hard day's work and feels like home. Only silly gripe - when you reserve online you answer the question on whether you are a repeat guest. Front desk is maybe not…,
3,Still top shelf,Still one of my favorite NYC boutique hotels. Great rooms and great service. Highly recommended. One of the very few NYC hotels with a large bathroom vanity space 😎  Very consistent. Looking forward to seeing their new acquisitions in Prague and Budapest. ,
2,Great hotel| service| and location,Stayed at Hotel Giraffe for a weekend in January 2016. Wonderful location and service all around. The staff is extremely welcoming and helpful without being over the top. The room was large and clean and had everything we needed available. Wine and cheese each evening were great| the complimentary breakfast was more than you'd expect| and overall the hotel was excellent. I would absolutely stay here again without question.,
110,Beautiful hotel,This hotel was very good. It had very nice and courteous staff| and the room was comfortable. The continental breakfast was also very good| and they were very helpful with finding places around the city| and that was very nice. My only concern is that they should offer rollaway beds.,
2,nice,Lovely boutique hotel in Flatiron/Gramercy part of NYC. Calm and relatively spacious room| breakfast pleasantly essentialist| and nice wine and cheese reception in the late afternoon. Good location| good value for money.,
1,Great mid town hotel in New York,We booked this trip at the last minute and were pleasantly surprised with this hotel. The staff were friendly and very helpful | the hotel is in a great area | it's quiet and very clean . We will definetly try the other hotels in this group. Breakfast was great and the glass of wine in the evening was a nice touch ... ,
9,Family friendly home away from home,Nothing was a problem for staff. Welcoming in every way so it felt like 'home'. Rooms are lovely. A good size for New York and price. Went out of their way to provide Gluten Free snacks and breakfast option for my daughter. Highly recommended.,
23,They thought of Everything!,Our search for the perfect Manhattan hotel is over! Room was spacious and quiet (10th floor) and the bed was wonderful; furnishings stylish and understated. We loved wine and cheese every afternoon but even better: cappuccino around the clock. Breakfasts were a lovely way to begin each day - we stayed for 3| visiting kids with no extra room in apartment.  Will definitely be back (we've tried half a dozen in the last couple of years| this one is a keeper).,
5,hotel Giraffe,Everything was good - service| room| etc..... except that the lighting in the room was completely inadequate for a person| who like me likes to read Comfortable bed| good linens| plenty hot water| nice free brkfst and evening cocktail hour. Downstairs staff excellent. Everything good except inadequate bedroom lighting,
1,A very nice stay,I stayed for a week with my children| grandsons and granddaughter in four rooms (one suit and three Balcony King). The rooms were very nice. Especially good was that there was a door between the two rooms in the suite. The location of the hotel is also perfect.  The service and all the staff were excellent. Always smiling and ready to assist. It was very nice to begin the evening with some complementary wine and cheese in the lobby. I will certainly choose Giraffe next time I´m in New York,
1,Cozy hotel that felt like home!,Beautiful rooms| gorgeous lounge for drinks and breakfast| friendly staff who helped with any queries. Location away from midtown but still central to everything. Local restaurants and shops fantastic ,
49,Wonderful stay in the heart of the Flatiron district,My family had a wonderful weekend get-away at the Hotel Giraffe.  Right from the moment we arrived the staff| every member| was friendly and accommodating| even offering to find a nearby free parking space for my car to avoid the daily valet rate!  The hotel is beautifully decorated| immaculate| and in a wonderful location.  Easy walking distance to some amazing restaurants and great places to visit.  The evening snacks were lovely as was the live piano.  We will definitely return.,
83,Fantastic Hotel,We had excellent service from booking through check in whilst staying there and check out.  Booked 6 nights through their own web site.  On arrival was met by a couple of really nice receptionists/concierge that helped us check in smoothly.  They recommended we spent a few minutes at the free Hotel wine and cheese to unwind after our travels and someone took our bags and cases to our room.  (sorry didnt know who it was but very grateful) We relaxed before going to our room to freshen up and start our first night in New York.  The Hotel was spotless clean and fresh as were the rooms.  We were on the 11th floor which  did not really suffer from road noise or disturbance.  Beds were very comfy.  Buffet breakfast was very good with good choices and excellent staff to assist.  The…,
5,As a guest... This certainly was the best 😄,Great hotel| well positioned| and if you are using a a drop off courier like GO AIRLINK then you get dropped off nearly first| .......on the return journey home you are last to be picked up so straight to airport ( Go AIRLINK) detoured to miss traffic| because you are in a well positioned hotel. Staff at hotel bloody amazing couldn't do enough for you| so helpful| having stayed in other hotels in NY this was the best and would def stay there again. Had free wifi and tea/ coffee all day| with cakes and biscuits didn't expect this but really appreciated it after out all day. Eve 5-7pm wine and cheese Yep FREE and so professional by the Two ladies that ran this| although some people took too much in my opinion and could ruin it for the future. I mean have a glass or two but 5 or…,
25,Have a laugh at the Giraffe!,We loved this place!  Friendly| helpful and efficient hotel staff not in your face but always there to offer advice or help if needed.  Spotlessly clean rooms with turn down service including a chocolate!  Breakfast was just what your needed| well catered and attentive staff.  Complimentary tea and coffee throughout the day| always a little biscuit available whenever you return which was most welcome!  There is complimentary cheese and wine each evening which was delightful and again staff were very attentive| this is a very good selling point for the hotel and doesn't fail to deliver!  I would recommend this hotel for a NYC visit| within walking distance of everything  and location lets you enjoy sites in NYC that you would perhaps not always appreciate.  Hopefully we will be…,
2,The best service and accommodations in New York City!!!,From the moment you enter until you depart your every request/need is met.  The staff is charming| helpful and knowledgable| especially Gabriella and JR.  The rooms are spacious and elegant.  A real home away from home.  The breakfasts are nutritious and plentiful.,
139,Perfect hotel,We choose to stay here for a variety of reasons based on the trip advisor reviews. We were not disappointed! The friendly service makes you feel very welcome| the complimentary breakfast| cheese and wine evenings made our stay feel special. The hotel is in a great location| being only 10 minutes walk away from the Empire State building. We also walked to Central Park from the hotel| however that was a long day... Plenty of restaurants nearby or short taxi rides away. I would recommend a room on a higher floor as you can hear the street noise from the lower floors (we changed from the second floor to the eighth due to street noise). We will return to this hotel when we visit NYC again!,
1,Excellent!,Loved the professional service. Comp breakfast| snacks and happy hour added great value. All special requests completed immediately. Nice decor| great sound proof windows. No outside noise audible even on third floor.,
2,5 star service and amenities,We booked a 2 bedroom suite for our family of 2 adults and 3 children direct with the hotel. We arrived after a very long trip from Australia to staff who were very sympathetic of this and ensured all aspects of check in went smoothly. It was the small touches that made this hotel one we will strongly recommend to our friends. The breakfast and wine and cheese evenings were lovely. All the staff were friendly and treated my children very kindly. The rooms exceeded my expectations and were oversized and the suite with 2 interconnecting rooms perfect for our family. Thankyou. I also highly recommend you book through the hotel any transfers from the airport as ours went very smoothly and were of a very high standard.,
9,Do yourself a favour and stay here!,We stayed 4 nights at this hotel| and Thoroughly enjoyed our time here. The staff were friendly| but not ingratiatingly so; the buffet breakfast was good| and the wine and cheese in the evening was delightful. There were 3 in our party| and we had a 1 bedroom suite| with a sofa bed in the lounge; it was a bit cosy in the suite| but we were only there to sleep| so it was fine. Location appears to be a bit out of the way| but it is actually quite handy| being between midtown and downtown| so you can walk to lots of tourist spots from here! Would thoroughly recommend staying here.,
70,Great location!,Located across from the New York Life Insurance building| intersection of 26th St and Park Ave S| this is a GREAT spot with some wonderful amenities. There is no pool or exercise area (you should get your exercise walking| sightseeing) but that is what makes this boutique hotel so convenient. The snacks we had were mainly cookies| danish| croissants during the day| with wine and cheese and fruit available at 5pm cocktail time.   It rained on our last two days| but the complimentary umbrellas made up for the soggy city :),
101,Excellent experience,Nice room| excellent service| convenient location. We'll away from the tumult of midtown. Continental breakfast were very nice.  Just a great comfortable establishment. Plan to be back. Convenient to the major subways.,
46,An outstanding hotel in New York,A boutique hotel with friendly attentive staff. Well positioned in Manhattan and within walking distance of the main tourist spots and some excellent restaurants. We visited on a long weekend from London. Great value for the location and quality of the service.  Breakfast was included and offered a good choice of fruit | cereals and pastries.  A very enjoyable stay.,
32,Short break ,Just had a four night stay in the hotel.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Rooms were clean and tidy.  Continental breakfast in the morning was very relaxed and if you pop back during the day you can help yourself to tea| coffee and biscuits.  Wine and cheese in the evening was a nice touch.  Very close to a lot of the tourist sights.  Would definitely stay again.  ,
1,50th Anniversary Trip,Wonderful staff... friendly and helpful.  Room was on the corner of Park & 26th and quiet enough for a restful night.  Wine & cheese with soft jazz on the piano was the perfect beginning for the evening.  We would recommend it for anyone who likes midtown over the noisier sections of the city.,
13,Nice stay at the Hotel Giraffe,This was my second time staying at the Hotel Giraffe. The hotel is very comfortable and very convenient for the business I had in the City.  Nice selection for breakfast.  I also like the fact that there is coffee and tea available all day in the lobby.  I would have given 5 stars except for the fact that I had to have my room key reset 3 times during a two day stay -- apparently their key card system is older and this happens frequently.,
11,One of the best hotel experiences I've ever had !!!,From the moment we walked in everything was perfect. It is like a small family. All the staff remembers your names| ask what your plans are and also so willing to help in any way! Can't wait to be back! ,
271,Really nice Hotel,Just recently stayed at the Hotel.  Great staff - very comfortable Lobby.  Wine and cheese in the afternoon + piano.  Breakfast was better than  most.  Nice decor in the room.  Only complaint outside noise.  Request a high floor. l,
107,Quaint and Lovely,I travel on business all the time .. Nyc is always a challenge to find a conviement hotel that works for my commute to my office and at the same time has real value for the dollar and some luxury amenities . All this may seem like lofty goals but not at all ..' With time and a few search applications on your smart phone hotels and wishes are only a swipe away ... The Girrafe is a hotel I have been wanting to try for a while .. I finally was able to align my needs with their availability and value .. The hotel is smaller than you would imagine only around 70 something rooms .. The lobby is big and at 5 pm or so they set up a wine and cheese station that seems to be a big hit with the hotel patrons .. The rooms are very nice .. Well appointed rooms with nice luxury feetures like…,
15,Fantastic short break!,We had a fantastic 4 day break in New York| visiting many iconic tourist places. We enjoyed watching skating at 3 skating rinks| Central Park| Bryant Park and at the Rockefeller Centre! Visited Grand Central Station| One world Trade Centre and took an evening open top bus tour as well as seeing the Lion King.   Staying at Hotel Giraffe was perfect in every way.... good location...clean and very comfortable room over looking Park Avenue South. The staff were friendly and attentive from the moment we arrived. The hotel serving breakfast was fantastic and an excellent touch was the wine and cheese evenings in the lobby.  Thank you Hotel Giraffe for making our visit perfect...Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all.  Lynne,
86,Great location| friendly staff| nice rooms,Overall no complaints with Hotel Giraffe.  The location is very convenient with access to Flatiron| Union Square| Chelsea all very close.  The room itself was nice| bathroom was nice but nothing special.  I would definitely consider staying here again.,
1,Home away from home,This review is long overdue. Since discovering the Hotel Giraffe in mid 2013| I have stayed there more than 20 times| and would not consider staying anywhere else in NYC. The location is great| the atmosphere is simple but elegant| and the rooms are both comfortable and well appointed. But above all else| the staff is superb! I consistently receive professional| efficient| and friendly service from each and every person that I have contact with. I think of the Hotel Giraffe as my home away from home| and that is in great part due to the excellent people who work there.,
7,Best gem in the city,I cannot say enough about this hotel. From management to the front desk to the porters. They cannot please you enough!!! I have been going to this hotel for many years and  have recommended The Hotel Giraffe to many people. All were extremely satisfied. So many amenities that you do not find at other hotels. It's is truly an oasis. I will never stay any where else. Why should I?,
1,great hotel,all staff welcoming and efficient  stayed here many times..would highly recommend .wine and chesses served nightly in the lobby accompanied by a piano player.  rooms are spotless| with turndown service at night,
38,Love this hotel!,Family trip to New York| 2 adults| 2 teenage girls. Rooms are rather spacious for NYC and very comfortable| fairly large bathroom. Attentive staff| particularly the ladies serving breakfast and evening drinks/snacks. Location is a south of Times Square but walkable if you are happy to wander and explore. Close to Macy's and lots of good restaurants and a block away from the subway. Would not hesitate in booking again if we returned to New York.,
1,Superior Staff - Great Location - Great rooms!,"Could not be happier with every aspect of our stay at Hotel Giraffe. I took 4 members of my team there with their significant other and the hotel ""wowed"" us all weekend long. I highly recommend Hotel Giraffe| you will not be sorry!  John",
22,Great hotel good location,Never had a better hotel in NYC. Quiet| clean| very friendly staff. Not so big but that's excactly what I like. You feel like a guest here. Metro station is only 2 blocks walking. The 26th street is nicely located in the middle of all attractions of Manhattan. In the afternoon there is free wine for the guests.,
2,Little Gem,Hotel Giraffe tucked in on the corner of 26th and Park was a perfect find to be close to our daughter's apartment in Grammercy Park.  The staff was very nice and friendly and the hussle bussle of NYC seemed a distance away once we entered the lobby. Our room was one of the nicest and largest we have stayed in in NYC. The decor was smart and elegant. A fairly large bath and balcony was an extra plus.  It was really great to have free little treats to eat the lobby as we returned throughout the day|  Wine and cheese happy hour and continental breakfast in the room rate was a extra touch and benefit too.  Finally| it was fun to explore the Flatiron area which I had never done before.  I am sure we will be back.,
3,Never disappointed...,Have been staying at the Hotel Giraffe for our trips to NYC multiple times every year for the last 10.  Consistent excellent service and accommodations| great location: just 2 blocks from 6 train| several 4 star restaurants within a very short walking distance.  It's no wonder they have very loyal guests.,
283,pleasantly surprised,Hotels in Manhattan can be a little disappointing. Not in this case. We found our suite to be modern and comfortable. The bathroom large. The kingsize bed and the view of Park Avenue made this a really enjoyable stay. Continental breakfast in the morning on the 1st floor a nice touch. The staff is attentive and helpful.,
1,Best secret in NYC,I will never stay anyplace else in NYC..... we got a recommendation from a client and so happy we followed his lead. The staff could not have been more helpful and the giraffe is close to everything! Awesome Experience!!!,
3,December business trip,We are veteran Hotel Giraffe guests.  We keep coming back because the rooms are comfortable| the people are very courteous and accommodating| the pass to the gym appreciated| and generous wine and breakfast hours managed by a genuinely guest oriented staff.,
5,An enjoyable stay in New York City at the Hotel Giraffe,We had a great stay at the Hotel Giraffe . The room was nice and roomy and service by all excellent.My wife is gluten-intollerant which we had mentioned when booking |and they had options for her which was appreciated. We found the location was perfect |with a short walk to the sub-way. All in all we will be back again.,
22,Lovely staff| great location| standard of rooms excellent.,"This hotel was not the cheapest we looked at but it was worth the money.  The staff were very friendly and helpful (in particular the lady who hosted the nightly Cheese & Wine event) and the location was perfect for our visit (sightseeing).  The only comment I could make about the hotel that is not complimentary is the fact that my room layout meant that the door to the bathroom was directly opposite our rooms ""front"" door.  The bathroom door had a large glass panel in it (opaque but not that opaque!) which meant that when our friends came to our room| they had a very good view of anyone that might be sat on the loo!!  This might not have bothered some people but it bothered me!! I would have preferred there to be a light curtain/blind that I could have used across the panel.",
1,6 night stay in NYC,Room excellent| staff excellent! Could not fault it! Would go back! Asked for room service a couple of times and was pleasantly surprised by the attention to detail to service provided| concierge and reception staff were fantastic!,
2,highly recommended,Staff was most helpful and accommodating. Service was outstanding. Rooms were quaint and lovely. Food was also good. Location is great - felt safe at all times. Overall excellent on all aspects of my stay with you!,
36,Great hotel in a great spot,This hotel is part of a small chain and having stayed in another hotel in the chain before I knew the service would be good and I wasn't disappointed. The hotel is I'm midtown and as such gives you access to all of Manhattan with relative ease. The rooms are spacious for a big city and very clean. The service in general is excellent and the concierges are very knowledgeable. The breakfast and snacks throughout the day are excellent and the quality of the cheese and wines in the evening is good. This is a great hotel if you want to be a little further away from Times Square and everyday tourist trail. There is an great rooftop space to enjoy the views with a hot chocolate. An excellent place to stay. One negative whilst we were there was that one of the lifts wasn't working but I…,
81,Clean and updated,The giraffe hotel  What a nice surprise.  The hotel rate was kind of low so I didn't expect much for this hotel.  But when I opened the hotel room door| it was very nicely updated and the room was clean. They provided shaving cream and tooth paste which I forgot to pack.  Best is the linen bedding| it was very crisp but also cozy.  I highly recommend this hotel.,
150,Thanksgiving in NY,We really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The room was ample| clean| comfortable| and quiet  The value was good for the money.  The staff were very helpful| pleasant and professional.  My wife| daughter (12) and I would stay there again.,
6,Excellent as always,When I travel to New York City| The Hotel Giraffe is my first choice. The location away from the uptown hustle and bustle| the quality of the rooms| the service and the attention and friendliness of the staff are the reasons I keep going back. Not to be missed is their complimentary evening wine and cheese with piano music which helps to relax after a day at the office or shopping.,
1,Love This Hotel,I have stayed at the Hotel Giraffe 4 times so far.  I've loved it each time.  It is conveniently located to attractions within the city. For personal reasons| it is convenient for me as it is located near my relatives.  I don't see any,
2,Family| holiday visit,Excellent great looking very inviting hotel| excellent very accommodating staff| warm very clean rooms| I have family all around new york city so the location is of the hotel is perfect for me|subways| surface transit| cabs etc| I have stayed at Giraffe on plenty of occasions it's has always a complete pleasure.,
64,Cozy Oasis in Midtown Manhattan,We recently took a family vacation to NYC and stayed at the Hotel Giraffe and were pleased with our stay. The staff were extremely nice and helpful. We loved the evening wine reception with live pianist as well as continental breakfast each morning. We stayed in a suite on the second floor| which was ideal for our family| During the day| it gave us living space| and at night| the kids had their own room on the pull out sofa. Since it is a fairly quiet part of town| we didn't hear too many city noises or car horns even though we were just above street level. If you do have trouble sleeping| the Hotel Giraffe also offers a variety of sleep aids including ear plugs| sleep phones| and satin eye mask| among others. Finally| we enjoyed the location just blocks from the Subway station.…,
3,Great place,Wonderfully nice staff! They gave great tips| and suggestions! Definitely will be staying again when we get to go back to NYC.  Also| I must admit...I became truly addicted to the cappuccinos in the lobby!,
3,The only hotel I stay in when in NYC,"My most recent stay was a week of both work for the first three days| then pleasure for the remainder.    The Giraffe is ""out of policy"" as far as our corporate expense system is concerned| so I pay for my stays at the Hotel Giraffe out of pocket without recuperating the cost| and do so with pleasure.  I joke with my colleagues that| frankly| I'm unaware of any other place in Manhattan that can actually dare to call itself a hotel besides the Giraffe.  A bit hyperbolic| I'm aware.  However I don't value the garish| over-the-top presentation of the big ultra-luxury establishments| nor the cloying and insincere fawning of some of the business-oriented hotels.    What I appreciate about the Giraffe is the genuine attention to detail.  All I want to do in my work is get it right;…",
1,Hidden Gem,I almost don't want to share what a great hotel this is but I suppose I must!  I have stayed here several times--sometimes on my own and sometimes with family--even extended family from England.  Everyone has loved this elegant and warm boutique hotel.  Since I am an ex-New Yorker| I know better than to stay in Times Square!  The location is perfect| subways and buses are convenient and there are so many wonderful restaurants within walking distance.  The hotel is spotless| service is fantastic and the rooms are a very good size.  The continental breakfast and wine and cheese reception in the evening are such nice touches.  I like that it is a small hotel and that there is always someone at the door.  After finding this hotel| I won't stay anywhere else in N.Y.,
43,A lovely friendly hotel in midtown,The hotel is spotlessly clean| staff so friendly and helpful - nothing is too much trouble. The wine & cheese evenings are lovely and relaxed. Breakfast is good with gorgeous fresh fruit| cereal| pastries| bagels etc. etc. rooms are spacious & well appointed with great showers. Overall a great choice!,
7,Overnight escape,We had a lovely overnight at the Hotel Giraffe to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. The staff was attentive| knowledgeable and friendly. We were also given a complementary bottle of wine to celebrate. The wine and cheese and continental breakfast offered in the lobby was a nice perk! The room was large| bed comfortable. All in all a perfect over night in NYC.,
144,NYC hotel,I got a great price at this fabulous hotel by checking at the last minute for availability the week before Thanksgiving. Very clean| wonderfully comfortable bed| helpful and friendly staff| good comp breakfast.  I would happily stay again.,
12,Great hotel!,Booked a balcony king suite which was connected to a balcony queen room.  Rooms were spacious and clean and perfect for our family of five.  Check-in was easy and the rates were decent considering that we stayed the night before Thanksgiving.  Would highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again!,
61,Great as always! Never stay anywhere else!,We always stay at the Giraffe on 26&Park. We always get the two room suite and it is less expensive and more well appointed| beautiful and spacious then any hotel in its class. It is unbelievably prices given the delicious free breakfast and wine and cheese in the afternoon every day. It is an amazing and quiet location right by the subway| and multiple notable restaurants and hotels.. Just blocks to herald square. The service is great.. Beds comfortable and towels always fluffy. We will always come back!,
1,Thanksgiving Fun!,Hotel Giraffe is an excellent place in Midtown.The hotel could not be cleaner and the staff nicer. That would be enough|but every morning a beautiful free breakfast buffet| and complimentary wine and cheese for Happy Hour everyday!,
2,Clean And Bright Boutique Hotel,Great boutique hotel. Very clean and bright| but as per usual in NYC| the rooms are quite small. The complimentary continental breakfast is a very nice touch and offers a wider variety than usual. The lobby area is also very bright and clean. Overall a very good energy with a new and modern vibe. I think it's a bit overpriced for the size| but you pay for quality not size in the city. I would definitely stay here again if I needed to be in the area.,
5,excellent hotel,The rooms are clean| stylish and functional| the staff is professional and courteous| and the location is ideal| near the Flatiron District. I would definitely recommend Hotel Giraffe for pretty much any purpose,
453,Doesn't Get Much Better,I really liked this hotel.  The room (second level up from bottom) was large| nicely appointed| had a fridge| free bottled water and a good bed with nice linens.  There was also the standard desk but nicer than standard| arm chair and ottoman and another chair.  The amenities included free wi fi| gym passes to a well equipped nearby gym| very good breakfast (not hot food but very good fruit salad| bagels| muffins| yogurt| hard boiled eggs| coffee| cappuccino| espresso| etc)| free coffee| cappuccino| expresso| water| teas and cookies and pastries in the lobby all day and an extensive wine and cheese including nuts| veggies with dip and a good selection of cheese.  I don't drink alcohol so I can't comment on the wine.  Staff was very friendly and location very good with nearby…,
123,Yum yum| pigs bum!,Although we have visited NYC many times before (courtesy of my brother who lived in Connecticut for years)| this was the first time we had actually stayed in the city. Wasn't really full of awe for Times Square and surrounds| so decided to check out TA for recommendations of other visitors.  We chose the Giraffe as it was high in the listing| well situated| not badly priced and quite small with added extras - I will get onto those in a minute. We arrived at just before 8pm in the evening| were checked in| given our room key| had bags taken to room and were shown directly over to the lounge area for remainder of the daily wine and cheese offering which was just about to be cleared. However| we were asked our preferences| told to help ourselves and even offered refills to take…,
115,A Tall Order,A boutique hotel in downtown Manhattan at 365 Park Ave S| (26th St).  This is the best hotel we have stayed at in quite some time.  The service is great|  There is always someone willing to help you with whatever you need.  The rooms are very comfortable| clean and modern| with a spacious bathroom. The furniture is high end and you get nightly turndown service and chocolates.  The free continental breakfast is truly a complete meal and there is complimentary wine and cheese from 5-8 pm.  There is free wi-fi in all rooms and the lobby| which is set up for breakfast and the evening wine and cheese.  The sofas are comfortable and this area provides a great place for relaxing and socializing.  The hotel is a short walk away from many of the popular NYC tourist destinations (Empire…,
3,We will be back!,Stayed at Hotel Giraffe several times and loved the way we were treated| from the front desk to the gracious servers at (included) breakfast and evening wine and cheese. One bedroom suites are just the right size for relaxing and spreading out a little| but ask for a high floor if you are bothered by the sounds of early morning trash pick-up during the week.  Great location close to Madison Square Park| terrific restaurants| and an easy taxi ride straight up Park Avenue to museums and other attractions.,
400,Perfect in every way,There was absolutely nothing to fault at this hotel.  All of the staff at reception and the concierge were both very  friendly and professional this is something that you do not usually find at a hotel; how Gabrielle manages to remember what everyone has to drink  at the cheese and wine reception every night is incredible. The room was a very good size and I liked the little balcony. The little extras bottles of water and chocolates at turn down service.  I wish to also give praise to housekeeping I was ill one day and they made sure I was all right. The hotel is in a good location the subway a couple of minutes walk away and it was easy to walk to a lot of places. Yes it is more expensive than other hotels but sometimes you need to treat yourself :-),
13,Boutique excellence.,Excellent hotel in a very convenient midtown location.  Friendly helpful staff and a classy spacious room with a beautiful balcony view.  Evening reception and great breakfast were a bonus!  Wonderful stay and wouldn't hesitate to book again. ,
59,Great experience ,We stayed at the Giraffe and it was the smartest thing. Overall quieter than expected| very comfortable and the staff was informative and helpful. Loved the small balcony and look forward to hanging out on the rooftop next time. The location was perfect. It was easy to walk all around and cabs/uber found whenever needed. We would definitely stay here again.,
19,Fabulous Girls Weekend!,By far the best hotel I have ever stayed in in Manhattan! Unparalleled service & attention to detail. We loved the rooftop garden| the black & white cookies (yum!) &  bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon waiting in our room| the wine & cheese reception in the lobby| the turn-down service with chocolate| & the delicious breakfast in the morning! Everyone was so accommodating & friendly| especially RJ who checked us in that afternoon! Thanks for making our weekend in NYC so memorable!,
6,Night in the Big Apple,Beautiful| immaculate hotel! Friendly and inviting staff! Large| well-stocked bathrooms. A wonderful complimentary breakfast with fresh fruit salad and a variety of pastries! Great restaurants in the area. Wear your walking shoes| though. Shopping and museums are not in immediate area. Taxis are| of course| abundant!,
4,Noisy but nice,On the plus side - the rooms are nice and comfortable plus a good size. The location was perfect for our needs. However| ithe rooms arevery noisy. Even on the 26th Street side the street noise was really loud - the window glazing is completely inadequate. There is an exhibition hall opposite and the truck were in operation at all hours. However you could also hear people on the street and we were on the 11th floor...there was also some ongoing music buzz coming from somewhere...so if you are craving for piece and quiet this is probably not the hotel for you.,
1,Another Gem in New York's Crown,We have just completed our 4th stay at Giraffe Hotel Park Avenue New York. The hotel offers the perfect location and quality of  accommodation with a satisfying breakfast and wine |cheeses and live music in the evenings. There are a number of institutions in New York that provide visitors a reliable positive experience. My wife would say Macy's and we would both recommend The Giraffe Hotel. Location|cleanliness| the quality appointments with the rooms| the willingness to provide complimentary items to enhance the experience| which we took advantage of. The staff are polite| informed and genuinely considerate. This is why Giraffe Hotel  has remained prominent  within the tripadvisor rankings of New York's finest hotel and has so for many years. I would recommend The Giraffe Hotel…,
102,Fantastic little boutique hotel,Great service and very nice stay. The breakfast was a very nice touch. Loved the espresso machine. Wine and cheese at night was a added perk. There are good restaurants in the area but the hotel restaurant Bread and Tulips is good for drinks and food. I didn't have a view with the room but it had all I needed. Would definitely return.,
160,A quiet| friendly oasis in the middle of everything,Attentive service. Very comfortable reception area set up for quiet conversation  with breakfast | snacks wine and cheese. Would be fine fir a woman alone as would the lively retaurant with good and reasonably priced options. My friend and I shared a 1 bed suite. We enjoyed the sitting area on arrival and the sleep sofa was set up while we had drinks and dinner so we each had a bed. Perfectly quiet even on 2nd floor.,
6,Excellent all around,We stayed for 2 nights.  Fabulous perks include continental breakfast (almost non-existent in NYC)| snacks and beverages throughout the day and the wine and cheese from 5-8. The turn down service is amazing.  They prepare your arrival with fresh towels| chocolates| fresh water bottles| classical music playing| bed turned down| lights dimmed and blinds pulled.  This was so relaxing and much appreciated.   Front desk staff and valet service extremely accommodating and very friendly.  Hotel very clean and overall very relaxing atmosphere. Highly recommend this hotel.,
1,weekend with kids in nyc,hotel giraffe was the best experience in hotel travel with children we have had.  our room was pristine| the staff just lovely| and the location was perfect.  the wine and cheese hour was great| our kids sipped juice and the waitress was so nice.  i highly recommend hotel giraffe to anyone thinking of staying.,
1,Hotel Giraffe NYC,My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Giraffe this past weekend for the first time. The service was perfect and the staff could not have been nicer or more accommodating. We had a suite and it was lovely. The breakfast was perfect and we loved the wine and cheese every night. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again. ,
14,Outstanding in every respect ,Sitting in the lobby before we leave for JFK and back to Scotland I just wanted to take a minute to put in a quick review for this outstanding Manhattan Hotel.   Location| service and quality have all been first class.  Everything is low key but to a very| very high standard.   I wasn't really prepared for how much fun New York would be and the Giraffe guys have been front and centre in almost everything we've done this past week to make it so great. Thank you.   It's completely wrong to single out any individuals when the whole team have been so good but I'll do it anyway. Chris on the front desk and Gabriella in the lobby bar - you have been truly outstanding and thanks for making our visit to your hotel and city so memorable.   To the management team -it is really reassuring…,
59,Little bubble of peace in the big city,Follow up review: I had enjoyed my visit to Hotel Giraffe very much so I came back with my sister for a quick overnight so we would have more time in the city. We had a beautiful room and as always the service is great. This was a splurge for us but we did not regret it. The breakfast in the common space downstairs is very good and a relaxed way to start the morning. The location is great| we were able to walk to most places we wanted to go. We missed the wine event in the evening so I guess I'll have to go back again sometime.,
43,New York Holiday with our grand-daughter,We loved this boutique hotel| very quiet and comfortable| just a block away from the best Indian restaurants in New York City. excellent breakfast| clean and relaxing| close to many of the best tourist attractions in New York City| we walked to the Empire State Building and the Flatiron Building.,
73,Good stay.,Stayed for a week back end of October. My wife and I enjoyed our stay here. Booked the room with two large double beds and a balcony. Really comfortable and a good size. This was on the 11th floor with good views to the streets below.This hotel is in a great location for walking to many of New yorks attractions and help is at hand at the desk for guidance.The free breakfast is fine with a good choice. We only went to the wine and cheese on offer every night the once as you cant get a beer and Im not a wine drinker.There is not a bar as such.All the staff we encountered proved to be friendly and professional . Book this hotel with confidence. I would again !,
30,Great service| great location,We have stayed here in the past| and loved the location and the simple| modern decor. We have a stay coming up that we had an issue with and I have to say that the I was so surprised how fast they were to respond via email and that they were able to solve our issues. Highly recommend. Thanks!,
35,Safari at the Giraffe ,We are just about to take a car back to JFK after the most fantastic week. This is a fabulous boutique hotel.The staff here can't do enough for you| whether you are enjoying the complimentary breakfast| wine and cheese reception every night| turn down service| or just passing through the lobby. The facilities in the room are very good| robes| slippers| complimentary bathroom toiletries| to wifi and docking station. The location is great for exploring the island and all the sights. We have stayed at the sister hotel| The Library| and would highly recommend both. ,
4,Hotel Giraffe Rocks,"Had a 2 day ""girlfriend"" trip in NYC and chose this boutique hotel on a recommendation.  As we pulled up in the rain| the bellman greeted us with a giant umbrella and walked us into the hotel.  As our room wasn't ready| we enjoyed cappuccino and biscotti in the lounge.  Before we left the hotel for dinner| a beautiful spread was laid out for cocktail hour in the lounge.  Who doesn't love champagne!  The room was beautiful and immaculate and the staff couldn't have been more accommodating.  4 stars only because of the price| which was a little steep for a one night stay.  Oh| did I mention the lavish continental breakfast!",
119,Great Location,Stayed in this smaller hotel as we were in New York for 14 days and didn’t want to stay in a large impersonal hotel.  Room on the 11th floor and was fairly quiet.  Staff are very friendly| helpful and personable.  Ask for their NY map which is great for navigating NY. Cappuccino fixes at Gregory’s 327 Park Av S or Toby’s 160 5th Avenue! Breakfast very good selection| gluten free bread available| need to bring own cereal| otherwise fruit salad| yoghurt| eggs available.  Cocktail host| Gabriella is certainly a star!  Warm| friendly and fun host who gave us plenty of sightseeing tips.   The only slight negatives were that the service to our room was very variably from room completely made up to no water left or no towels and dirty linen left in the room.  Easily sorted by calling…,
72,great boutique hotel in NYC,We arrived a little early for check in. We were told they would try and hurry up the maid| however we weren't allowed to our room| until 10 minutes after the check in time. I was a little annoyed at this however they did compensate us with a complimentary bottle of wine| which we appreciated. We stayed in a king room with a balcony. The room was lovely| and it was so nice to have a balcony in NYC. The hotel served complimentary wine in the evening and had a great roof top you could sit at and enjoy the drink. The staff were really nice. The breakfast was great and complimentary. The location of the hotel was perfect. Away from the hustle and bustle| but only a short walk to Bryant park. Dos caminos is next door which is also a bonus. We will definitely be returning!,
11,Fabulous Family Celebration,On arrival| my mom's room had an iced bottle of champagne in celebration of her 80th birthday.  Every staff member we encountered was helpful| knowledgeable| friendly and professional.  The lobby was really comfortable with area seating| coffee bar| snacks| breakfast| and evening happy hour.  Our rooms were clean and comfortable. Taxi's| Uber and public transportation made getting around easy. Hotel Giraffe made my mom's birthday trip to NYC fabulous!,
13,Perfect,This hotel was very well located and close to subway stations and attractions. The room was very large| I stay in NY a lot and this was by far the largest room I've had. There was a separate sitting area away from the bedroom (it was a suite). Staff were very friendly and helpful with anything we needed. There is complimentary wine and cheese in the lobby every evening and breakfast each morning. All of which we did not take advantage of. Try the restaurant across the street Upland| its very interesting and they have really good breakfast.,
1,Great hotel,The evening happy hour is excellent! Food was very good|especially the cheese and wine selections. Room was perfect and comfortable. Location was close to everything we needed. Would definitely come back.,
198,Great Location w/some Freebies,Husband and I were invited to an event and this is where they made reservations for us.  Arrived on a Sunday (entrance is on 26th); we stayed for 3 nights.    Pros: Very large room; living room with door separating bedroom and bathroom in hallway  Balcony Many closets (we had 4) 2 thermostats (one in living room & one in bedroom) Many layered blinds/curtains to block out light Free Wi-Fi Free Wine & Cheese from 5pm-8pm every night with piano player Free Coffee & Pastries in the morning (never tried this) Free access to New York Sports Club (since they don't have a gym) Turndown service w/chocolates Umbrella in room (excellent| since it rained every day we were there) Couple of bottles of water provided free of charge (plus there's a refrigerator in the room to keep your water…,
760,Quiet oasis in a great midtown location,"The room size is large and very comfortable. I had an adorable balcony that was really a treat in the city (overlooked a side street so I wasn't on display - thank goodness)! They have a really good room darkening shade that lowers with a switch and I appreciated that. The breakfast - which is included - has a nice selection of healthy options and the afternoon ""tea"" looked beautiful although I had to leave for a meeting just as they were setting it out. I found the TV remote to be confusing which may have been me| but if you have trouble open the cabinet door as sometimes the signal can't get through and that was all I needed to do in the end. Nice toiletries| amenities| robes and slippers. Strong wi-fi included and I spent hours working on it with no problems at all. A…",
2,Best hotel in New York!,We have stayed in many hotels throughout the world and The Hotel Giraffe is far and away the best hotel ever.  The staff is super attentive| hotel extremely clean| best breakfast and wine and cheese hour - Gabriele| the hostess at wine hour| is awesome!,
38,Hotel Giraffe - A Lovely Oasis in midtown Manhattan,"The maxim ""You get what you pay for"" stands true for this lovely gem in the Murray Hill/Flatiron district of Manhattan. I have stayed here on business twice a year for several years and will continue to come back. The complimentary breakfast and cocktail hour enhance the value. Rooms are lovely| immaculate and comfortably sized.  The staff is outstanding in every regard.  The hotel is in a great spot in this trendy neighborhood.  Highly recommend! P.s. the Bread & Tulips restaurant on lower level is a great spot.",
10,Simply the best!,We visited New York in September 2015 to get married in Central Park.  From the moment we booked the hotel| we knew we had made the right decision.  We received excellent service from the very start.  Every single member of staff we encountered was friendly and helpful with a smile on their face.  A very special mention to Mike who was an absolute star in helping us select restaurants and bars| and then helping with the booking arrangements too - a top man!  The hotel itself was fantastic!  A fantastic location in the middle of Manhattan - a healthy walk to downtime and the City Hall and also walk-able to Central Park.  Loads to do nearby - couldn't have been better.  The rooms were great - large for NYC we thought - and the reception area was a real treat.  A brilliant…,
82,Top notch,Excellent hotel.  Happy hour and breakfast included in the price are good extra touches.  Rooms can be a bit noisy| but this IS New York City| and staff do their best to help| with earplugs and sleep bands available.  All the staff are extremely helpful and friendly| offering advice from local restaurants to subway routes| and take an interest in their guests. Our room was spacious and comfortable| with good bed linen| towels and toiletries. A suggestion to the management would be to rearrange the suites| so that the sleeping area is at the rear and the living area overlooking the street| this would eliminate the problems with street noise.,
4,Nice room / great staff / central location,A nice room at reasonable prices ... for NYC. Breakfast and cheese&wine in late afternoon included. Very nice staff serving you there. Location is very central - to reach all placed in Manhattan quickly via subway or taxi. I will come again.,
2,Week in New York,"Stayed here for a week..........it was so good to walk into the calm & relaxing lounge of Hotel Giraffe| after the ""in your face"" sidewalks of NYC! Like coming home to enjoy a coffee| or having Gabrielle spoil us at ""drink time"". So good to just sit & ""regroup"". Our suite was just what we wanted & roomy| plus the staff were so accommodating with our daughter who was travelling with us.",
68,Amazing weekend,Family meeting in NYC and the hotel was the perfect choice.Many choices for breakfast and a great wine reception at night.The room was immaculate and they set up a coffee Keurig for us in the room.Loved it!,
1,could be great with a few adjustments,Staff was super friendly| outstanding guest service! Room small for price| though clean and well-appointed. Breakfast and cookies okay| nothing special; great to have custom coffee drinks. Room super noisy all night long  -- NYC garbage trucks I guess but seemed like it went on forever. I was on floor 7 and still not high enough! Consider thicker curtains/shades. Rolling blackout shade in room did not extend to edge of windows so light came in at both edges| hard if you're a bad sleeper as I am.  Roof deck was closed entire month -- this should have been noted when I reserved| that one of the main amenities was not avail when I visited. A bit annoyed by this surprise and so were other guests as you showcase the deck as a main feature.,
180,Another great stay at Hotel Giraffe,We returned to HG for the third year running. This place does not disappoint. By NY standards the rooms/suites are large & airy with all the amenities you would expect. What really makes this hotel special though is the staff. Everyone goes out of their way to talk to you and nothing is too much trouble. The evening wine and cheese service is a fantastic bonus and Gabriella is an exceptional hostess who even remembered our favourite tipple from last year! Worth her weight in gold and very hard working! The breakfast ladies too do a sterling job and make breakfast enjoyable. David was also very helpful and even kindly confirmed a restaurant reservation for us before we arrived from the UK to ensure we did not lose our table. The hotel is situated within easy walking distance of…,
1,Weekend sojourn,Have stayed here now 4 times over last couple years and it gets better each time.  The staff is really special and we have seen essentially no turnover| suggesting a good work environment as well. Such a classy boutique hotel.,
1,Bad news,Unfortunatly I lost 2 sweaters in my room....We have to call 3 times to have  some news. For the rest it is a good place to stay. It is a very nice hotel. The fact  that we have to call 3 times without their intervention it is a bad satisfaction.,
19,Fantastic Hotel,We loved our stay here| you can not find fault at all| it's ideal Hotel for location|  staff were fab| rooms lovely and spacesh| and the wine and cheese in the evening was fab too. I would recommend any one stay here.,
128,Great Oasis that Delivers What it Promises,"We had a great stay here and we think you will| too.  The hotel staff are friendly and very competent.  There is ""just enough"" of everything to make it fine but not fussy.  Nothing is ""over the top"" but you have what you need.  The rooftop area was closed for an event while we were there| so we did not get to see it - but to us the only missing thing was a bar for a nitecap before heading to bed - the roof might have been it.  Our room was very clean| bed comfortable| rooms quiet - and for NYC that's a great plus.  If you want to be a bit out of the action - stay here.  Oh| Madison Square park is a block a way - wonderful people watching.",
1,Wife's birthday weekend,We've been to Hotel Giraffe 4 times and the last one was a week ago to celebrate my wife's birthday.  Everything from the valet to the concierge to the room to the wine tasting and continental breakfast the next morning was superb.  I sent a quick note to the hotel that it was my wife's birthday and they sent a wonderful card and beverage to the room.,
36,Good Service with Pleasant Surroundings,My husband and I enjoyed our special occasion stay at this nice location.The staff was warm and welcoming and efficiently took care of our every need.Our king balcony larger suite was tastefully decorated and immaculate.The only negative was poor and low lighting especially in the bathroom area. Otherwise perfect in every way.,
11,Hidden Gem,My husband and I stayed here on our first trip away without the kids| I cannot fault the hotel and the staff were just super. Great base for exploring the city and relaxing atmosphere in the lobby when you return from a hard days site seeing or shopping.  Breakfast included with your stay and complimentary tea and coffee all day. The complimentary wine and cheese early evening was a great way to start the evening before heading out to the theatre etc. If I am fortunate enough to return to New York I will definitely be staying at Hotel Giraffe and would also bring the kids to stay here as well. If you've got this hotel booked I don't think you will be disappointed it's just fantastic in an understated way. ,
1,The way to experience New York,This is a fine boutique property. Staff is attentive and thoughtful.  The morning continental breakfast supported by a good team and evening wine/cheese (Gabriela made the difference) with a piano accompaniment was superb.  Had a one bedroom suite that was well appointed and very quiet. This hotel will become our N.Y. regular.  ,
1,Feel welcome and at home in NYC,This was my first trip to NYC and even though this was far away from home for me in such a big city| the Hotel Giraffe staff made me feel at home| took care of anything I needed and were always friendly. Breakfast was outstanding| same for the wine and cheese reception. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again on my next trip. Thank you Hotel Giraffe for making our stay feel as if staying with friends!,
39,An Amazing hotel!,Just came back from three night at the Giraffe Hotel and could not be happier. The hotel far exceeding my expectations in every way. The rooms| staff| service were perfect! I look forward to our next visit in the Spring.,
10,A boutique gem,With A location that is convenient to Madison Square| Park/the Flatiron District| Midtown and the Village| the Giraffe is the perfect spot for well-heeled  tourists and business travelers alike.  While the staff is not as polished as the highest-end hotels| they make up for it by being extremely friendly  and welcoming.  As someone who  logs over 80 stays and 120 nights in hotels each year - from Four Seasons and Mandarin Orientals on down - I will safely put the Giraffe in the very top tier| and certainly at the top of the boutiques.   Highly recommended.,
17,Excellent Hotel Great Location Great Staff,We spent 8 nights at the hotel Giraffe |Hotel is perfectly located to explore New York |The staff are excellent |the rooms are excellent and cheese and Wine in the evening a great added extra . I would recommed this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in new york ...,
5,Fabulous Boutique HOtel in Manhattan,Fantastic find in a busy town.  We stayed at this hotel the week of Sept. 28 thru Oct. 2| 2015.  The best location in town as far as we're concerned.  The King Balcony Suite was spacious and beautifully decorated.  The continental breakfast as well as the 5-8 p.m. afternoon wine and cheese reception each day was a welcome addition to our hectic daily schedule.  I would like to especially commend Gabriella| the evening wine and cheese hostess.  She was extremely friendly and kind.  The entire experience at the Hotel Giraffe was truly a joy.,
2,Girlfriends trip in NYC,LOVED Hotel Giraffe. Went with three other girlfriends. Stayed 5 nights and it was really great!!!  Shared a room with two queens and we had enough room. Great sleeps. Wine and cheese daily was awesome. Location perfect - walking distance to lots of great places - food| drinks| jazz club| comedy clubs and roof top bars right around us. Subway close by. Hotel staff superb! Will definitely stay again and recommend to others.,
1,Very enjoyable!,Excellent hotel. The tea and coffee around the clock and the wine and cheese in the evening and the breakfast all free of charge is a great advantage. It is definitely our hotel in NY. Location is great| best restaurants in walking distance. Rooms are very well equipped| very clean | service is polite and very attentive. Armchairs in the lobby needs refreshment. A little bit noisy| but this is New York!  Overall very enjoyable! We have been in many hotels in NY in the same category | the Giraffe is our best choice.,
6,Very nice hotel in the center of Manhattan,Chronogically the main positive points: reception| transport of the luggages|spacious rooms with large windows and good bath rooms| roof garden. Vers pleasant was also the service of wine and food at the end of the afternoon. ,
3,We came back!,This was our second stay at Giraffe. We came back because we had such a great experience last year. It didn't change thankfully! It was good to see some of the same staff were there which is a good sign and they remembered us as well. We plan to return there again.,
2,Quick overnight stay,We stopped in New York for only one night on the way to Psris. It is a very pleasant hotel| nice location.  They have a good restaurant and you get a discount as a guest of the hotel.  The continental breakfast was better than expected.,
1,5 stars,Very accommodating from check-in to check-out. Very relaxing atmosphere| piano playing in the evening with a wine and cheese reception. Rooms are big and have complimentary books to read during your stay. We always come back to this hotel!,
37,Always a Perfect Experience,The Hotel Giraffe is probably the best hotel experience in Manhattan.  The rooms are reliably comfortable and clean| the service is outstanding| and the amenities are fantastic.  The delicious Continental breakfast and nightly wine & cheese make the Giraffe truly special.  The dining discount at the adjacent Bread & Tulips restaurant is a value-added feature.  ,
31,Everything we had hoped for at the Hotel Giraffe. Great boutique hotel in NYC,Just back from the Hotel Giraffe following a 4 day city break for our 40th wedding anniversary. We went with our son and his girlfriend and they also liked it a lot. Great people| especially Gabriella who looked after us every early evening for the wine and cheese parties. Junior|( our nickname for him following his story about his grandpa) the concierge - extremely helpful and sorted out our return taxi to airport.  Also David| who organised our booking and initial airport transfer (stretch limo) from when we booked in May right up to when we arrived.  Rooms were corner balcony suites and were excellent.  Sports bar a couple of doors away on the block and plenty of eateries within walking distance.  Macy's was no more than a 20 minute walk -  central park and the 9/11 museum…,
62,Goodish hotel,Have stayed at two other hotels in New York in this chain which were excellent| however this one was not quite as good overall. Would have to say the room was great| staff were good especially Gabriella (evening wine). Trouble was no info in room about services offered although info was at front desk. Number of tables for breakfast was limited especially at peak times. Surprised about closing time of roof top bar| 10pm which is quite early if you have been out all day.,
29,My Favorite NYC Hotel,Second stay in Hotel Giraffe| this time a four-day solo trip| first leg of a longer trip.  Got a decent price for a balcony king by contacting hotel directly| had a great view of city life.  This establishment is totally focused on customer service| no other way to describe it. Clean room and building.  Enjoyable breakfast. Seems like there is always something to drink and snack on all day long.  Wasn't able to partake of the evening wine/cheese social. Good wifi in room.  Close to subway stations. Nice neighborhood| felt safe walking around| even returning to hotel from subway late night.  Staff I interacted with were friendly| able to answer my questions| and projected an eagerness to assist me in anyway they could.  Love Hotel Giraffe and will stay here again.,
1,New York with Friends,We had six nights at Hotel Giraffe| the experience was top class. The rooms were clean and of a high standard| the employees were well trained and extremely courteous. The breakfasts and nightly wine and cheese sessions were very comforting. One small issue| the bathrooms need a extraction fan| for the comfort of others sharing the room. 9/10 !!!!!!!,
47,Everything you could need,We stayed here in September| the hotel has everything you could need. The staff are welcoming| helpful and remember all your specific needs. The breakfast has teas| coffees| pastry and fresh fruit to get you started for your day. There is refreshments available throughout the day and bottles of water for the guests. My favourite excuse to stay in is the wine and cheese reception each day| its a perfect way to start an evening in the city. The rooftop gardens are nice but don't provide a birds eye view like I expected| but if the weather is nice its a nice place to enjoy some peace and quite with the city buzzing beneath you. The rooms were larger than I expected with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on! The perfect touch is the turned down service with its sounds of…,
1,Our second stay,Cannot fault the Giraffe. This was our second stay and without doubt would return to the Giraffe for any subsequent visits to NYC. Very friendly|professional| competent people looking after us. Rooms have all our requirements are cleaned beautifully everyday|with bedlinen changed daily. Excellent breakfast and cocktail hour (lasting 3 hours!),
9,Absolutely ideal,The Giraffe is in a perfect location for seeing the sights both downtown and uptown.  This was our first visit to New York and the staff could not have been more helpful in providing advice| booking tickets| explaining the subway system and so on.  A big thank you to Jose in particular for wading fearlessly into the traffic to find a cab for us! The room was very comfortable| especially the bed.  The breakfasts were lovely and set us up for the day| while the cheese and wine made a good start for the evening's activities.  We'd thoroughly recommend it to anyone going to this most exciting of cities.,
1,The Giraffe-It's a Lofty Experience,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Giraffe. We took full advantage of the hotels excellent amenities which include continental breakfast| all-day refreshments and their delightful pre-dinner wine and cheese spread enhanced with live piano music. It's well located| near subway and bus and many interesting restaurants.  We are looking forward to a return visit next year.,
3,Great hotel,great hotel with helpful friendly staff and good breakfasts. Cheese and wine in the afternoon was a nice touch. Beds were extremely comfortable. Can be a bit of traffic noise in the morning but what else would you expect in the centre of NY.,
2,Stick Your Neck Out for a Boutique Hotel,The Giraffe Hotel is part of a small group of hotels and is a bit off the usual tourist area| being on Park Avenue South but is well worth sticking your neck out for. The staff were very efficient| helpful and friendly| especially Cody. The all day coffee and cookies in reception were very welcome after a hard day of sight seeing.The roof terrace is lovely but rather small but worth a look just for the giraffe. The rooms (as a group we booked 3) were comfortable| clean and had all the usual amenities| a fridge with complimentary water| hugh telly| slippers| toiletries| chocolates on the pillow and a coffee machine which you could use a simple kettle to make hot drinks with. The free wifi was a great bonus - it worked well.,
2,Great place to stay,A very friendly hotel team. Nice rooms. Clean. Complementary breakfast was perfect. The wine and chees each night was terrific. There are some great restaurants in walking distance many you need to book prior. Sadly the concierge is not up to speed on these but if you do your due diligence before arriving via restaurant reviews you can book before arrival. We would stay here again.                                   ,
56,For a small hotel the service and intimacy is huge.,We chose this hotel as it is a not a huge branded hotel and that it provided larger rooms at a fair price. We chose a bigger room as we travelled without 16 year old.    Located in midtown Manhattan and cloeto subway options also makes this a hotel a good choice.  There are restaurant and other options close by if you do not want to go to far from the hotel.   The morning breakfast (included) and the evening drinks and nibbles add are really nice touch with the drinks being available from 5pm through to 8pm.  The 4 nights we stayed at the hotel were very relaxing and enjoyable and if we visited NYC again we would definitely use this hotel again.,
1,VERY QUAINT QUIET AND PEACEFUL FOR THE BIG APPLE,The staff was top notch| they were very professional| helpful and even remembered how I liked my coffee.  I love the roof top for us smokers who so often feel ashamed or even put down for being a smoker.  It was very tranquil with a waterfall and just all around good feeling. I felt the same way about the rooms.  My favorite was  Jose| the door man| he made me feel like I could trust him and even hailed a cab back with his really loud natural whistle that I had left my shopping bag in.  He saved the day.  All the staff were extremely friendly and accomadating.,
6,Great| small hotel in the heart of NYC,This hotel is great for business travellers or pleasure seekers - small| cosy hotel with a free continental breakfast (perfect for vegetarians!) and free wine and cheese in the evenings. Close to major attractions ,
15,Stay here to get your money's worth.,The Giraffe is in a Fabulous location:  Two blocks from the 6 train| on Park Avenue| but away from the hustle an bustle of NYC.  Personable staff.  A great nights sleep.  FREE water bottles| breakfast| and nightly wine and cheese included.  What more could you want in NYC?!!,
9,Best staff you will ever find| complimentary food and drinks all day| beautiful rooms| no words to do it justice!,I'm from Oklahoma City and thought it would be a fabulous idea to take (4 teenage girls) and a family member| to celebrate my daughter's 16th birthday in NYC. None of us had ever been to NYC (btw| I wouldn't recommend taking a large group your first time or you will be overwhelmed regardless of all the planning you can possibly do beforehand).  If it were not for their hotel staff| we would NEVER have made it through the hustle and bustle of this crazy| but amazing city. In OKC everyone has a car and doesn't rely on public transportation| so it is intimidating to say the least.  They had to help me in ways that I would never expect a friend to do| let alone their amazing hotel staff who probably thought we were a little on the crazy side b/c we were so helpless.  And| they did…,
33,Fantastic!,This hotel is expensive| but so are most Manhattan hotels. For the price| they really go above & beyond to deliver excellent service. The concierge is very knowledgeable and professional| and went above and beyond to make reservations and give appropriate recommendations based on the individual's taste. There is a tasteful wine & cheese hour at night| which was my favorite part about this hotel. Continental breakfast was adequate.   The rooms are typical size for NYC| but have comfortable beds and tiny balconies. It was fun people watching from up above. Location was good. Close to the subway.,
7,Great location| friendly people & plenty of cheese Grommit!,We had an excellent 4 days| the room had plenty of space| the added dimension of a mini balcony plus a well presented bathroom. All staff were friendly & customer oriented. The location was perfect for us - just down from Grand central & the Empire state| a couple of blocks from the subway. We had a high floor which was excellent as central Manhattan can be quite noisy. We did not discover the rooftop area until the day we left - not great for views but excellent to get up off street level to some clear sky & air. As with a number of reviews| a special mention goes to host Gabriela who made the cheese & wine evening an absolute pleasure. We chose the hotel on the basis of this extra & we were not disappointed. You make difference Gabriela! Breakfasts too were excellent & we were…,
1,Delivered As Promised,Everything about the stay was quality| just like all the reviews.  The staff was excellent| professional| helpful and friendly. It will be my first choice for the lower East Side of Midtown.  Just blocks from 4-5-6. So convenient !,
13,Fantastic hotel,Excellent hotel. Staff are friendly and extremely helpful. Rooms lovely and comfortable. Beds comfortable and supportive. The breakfasts are very good continental-style with fresh fruit salad| bagels| Danish pastries| selection of cereals plus hard boiled eggs (didn't expect those). They have he most wonderful coffee machine| with a selection of teas and things like hot chocolate sachets. Danish pastries available all day!! Every evening they have what is effectively a cheese and wine party. The cheese is excellent and varied| the wine very good quality and served by an attentive hostess and they have (my favourite bit here) cruidites of salad to go with the cheese and crackers. In he convivial lounge this leads to a lot of interaction between hotel guests so that with the right…,
18,Great location| great location| great staff,This hotel is situated very close to a subway station less than 2 block walk)| and is in the heart to great eateries and Madison Square park.  The rooms themselves are small but normal size for NY rooms.  The furniture is looking a bit tired but the bed is comfortable.  The staff are great the whole way through and customer service is brilliant.  They offer Wifi| afternoon drinks and cheese every day| turn down service and breakfast all part of your stay.  We stayed on the 11th floor and it was noisy at times from street traffic but that's NY for you.  I highly recommend,
231,A wonderful stay,Just home from 5 nights in Hotel Giraffe. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Rooms delightful. Beds so so comfortable| ensuring a terrific nights sleep. The staff are a credit to the hotel. The desk staff are friendly courteous and so obliging. Continental breakfast was lovely. A short walk to the subway.,
180,Great midtown location,We recently stayed at the Giraffe in NYC for the second time. Both experiences have been very positive.  We like the midtown location and the size of the hotel. Our room has always been impeccably clean. The staff is very helpful. We liked the wine and cheese after 5pm in the lobby. Also| great hamburgers at the Shake Shack just a couple of blocks away in Madison Square Park.,
46,Great stay!,We usually stay at the sister hotel| the Library| but wanted a place closer  to our events.   We may switch now because the rooms and lounge are bigger| the location is better| and the valet parking is easier than the self parking.  Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful| and these small boutique hotels are just right for personal attention and feeling like you are valued.       ,
40,Amazing stay with baby in tow...,"Right - I'm just going to lay it out right in regards to the ""reservation snafu"" idiot...it's your fault if the email ends up in junk mail...its your job to check...simples - the staff at Hotel Giraffe were probably being upmost polite when they say it happens sometimes...but why is it their problem that you don't check your junk mail??!  Third floor noisy?  I doubt it - the windows and doors are triple / quadruple glazed - having LIVED on 36th street between 8th & 9th avenue right near Time Square...it's definitely quieter.  And besides it's New York| the city that never sleeps - get a life.  Rant over (sorry the hotel staff probably wanted to say all of this but couldn't) - it really winds me up that instead of focussing on the positive point - this idiot focused on the…",
12,Great relaxing Hotel,This hotel is a great place to come back to and relax after  a busy noisy day in NY. The cheese and wine is the best we have ever had and Gabi the wine waitress is exceptional. The glasses were never empty and he seemed to anticipated exactly what we wanted. The breakfast was very good too. The front desk staff were very helpful and knowledgeable. The room was a great size although we only had the queen-size room and we seemed to be upgraded to a balcony. Loved the hotel would definitely go back if ever in NYC again.,
5,Absolutely LOVE it here!,We have been staying at this Hotel for about 5 years when we come to NYC. It is always a super positive experience. The staff could not be nicer and more accommodating. The location is central yet still peaceful. The rooms are kept up very well and we love the all-day coffee| snacks and free breakfast as well.,
1,excellent service and friendly staff,It's the second time we have stayed at this hotel and have already recommended to family and friends who have also raved about the friendly staff who couldn't do enough  to ensure you had an enjoyable experience. Will definitely be returning.,
127,A model for excellence,From the ease of booking on their mobile app through the efficient check out process| the Giraffe was the best NYC hotel of the many I've stayed at. The room was well appointed and quiet| the bed was comfortable| the staff was excellent| particularly the doorman and the breakfast & wine reception hostesses.  I can't imagine staying anywhere else for my next visit! ,
6,Excellent stay in Midtown Manhattan,We spent 7 days at Hotel Giraffe| perfectly located between two subway stations| close to Madison Square Park. Our suite was very spacious and well equipped| the service extremely friendly and helpful when needed. We really enjoyed included breakfast and the complimentary daily cheese and wine service; special thanks to Gabriela who treated us so well. The roof top bar at level 12 is very nice.,
4,Reservation Snafu,I went to check in only to discover that my reservation was mysteriously cancelled. Despite the fact that the confirmation email (and the email requesting this review) had no problem getting into my email inbox the cancellation email went to junk email...a fact they said had happened before. FIX IT.  I will say the front desk was apologetic and managed to find a room...on the 3rd floor extremely loud traffic sounds which I've never had as bad even in Time Square. (I stay in NYC once a month)  Add a broken elevator so only one functioned. Horrible value for money. The only reason I'm giving it a 2 and not a 0 is the staff was nice   I will not be back,
1,Great hotel!,I really enjoyed my stay at Hotel Giraffe. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. The lobby area was great and functional. They had free breakfast| good pastries| fruits| cereal| coffee| tea| etc. They also offered wine and cheese which was nice. The room had a nice balcony and there was also a rooftop balcony. I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to family and friends.,
53,Superb boutique hotel,This was my first time staying at this excellent hotel on Park Avenue| but it will not be my last.  The hotel has the highest of standards| we had a beautiful king size room with balcony| big by New York standards.  The room was spotlessly clean with good amenities.  The staff throughout are friendly and professional.  I loved the complementary breakfast and the fact that wine and cheeses are served from 5pm.  All day the espresso machine is available for coffee in the lobby and cookies and fruit is at hand.  This is a great location and despite being on Park Avenue is quiet and serene. In addition there is a wonderful restaurant beneath the hotel| good food| nice bar and a welcoming ambiance,
47,Another wonderful stay,This is the third time we have stayed at the Giraffe and the standard is as high as ever. We went for a king size room with a balcony which was not cheap but worth every penny to be able to view New York life on the street below. We were able to order a complimentary tea/coffee machine for our room which was great to have an early morning cuppa in bed. We also took full advantage of the complimentary cheese and wine which was served between 5 and 8pm each evening. The staff were incredibly helpful and polite especially Gabrielle who sorted out our route by subway for us back to JFK This hotel is served by many restaurants in the area and has its own 'Bread and Tulips' accessed from the hotel if you don't want to venture far. We fully intend to return to this hotel next time we…,
1,great hotel,Been there many times and have had nothing but great service and courteous people.  Excellent at all levels.  The only thing missing is an in house gym| but you do get free passes at a gym three blocks away.  The location can't be beat.  The breakfast and the day long treats are outstanding.       ,
2,A wonderful boutique hotel,A wonderful hotel in a good location.  Friendly staff| nice rooms and a good breakfast to start the day.  Drinks and nibbles from 5pm was a lovely way to end a day of sightseeing.  The hotel was well located and very personal.  I would definitely recommend to anyone who prefers a smaller and more personal hotel experience.,
1,Wonderful Hotel,Our first time in New York| we stayed in the Hotel Giraffe| the hotel is family friendly. Our room had a Juliet Balcony which was lovely| spacious room was spotless| very comfortable bed (best sleep I've had in a long time) very quiet. Bathroom was beautiful with a good shower. We had a coffee machine in our room with lovely coffee. As a treat we all had an in room massage which was amazing. The hotel has free WiFi| it also has a lovely little roof top bar for a few cocktails or beers. Breakfast was served by a lovely lady| variety of cereals| fresh fruit| toast| muffins| bagels|fresh juice| coffee| latte| tea. Housekeeping staff| reception staff| all staff  were lovely and friendly. The hotel is near Madison Square Park which is beautiful and peaceful and within walking…,
1,Excellent Hotel,This hotel offers a real personal service. All the staff were welcoming and helpful| whether it was serving complimentary early evening drinks| or just welcoming you back from a day out. The suite we very comfortable for the 3 of us with great views down Park Avenue South. Two other things we appreciated were the coffee maker available in the room on request| and very comfortable bed.,
1,Friendly| helpful staff.,      I would go back to this hotel.                                                       They are knowledgeable about local restaurants| etc. Clean. Awesome location. Excellent breakfast. Doorman| front desk| breakfast workers: everyone very customer service friendly.                                                                                                   ,
2,Enjoyed our one night stay.,We had a corner room on the fifth floor - actually a suite which surprised me since I requested a classic room with Queen  size bed. The rate was quite competitive with other hotels in the area like the Ace or the Nomad where we have stayed previously. The room was quiet| clean and very large. The wine and cheese hours from 5-8 PM were great as was the complimentary breakfast in the morning. The only negative was that the TV remote controls were mystifying. Even after calling down to the desk and receiving a personal explanation| it was difficult to use the TV. This however was a minor glitch since the overall experience was great. We will definitely stay here the next time we are in the city.,
1,Girls in the City,I can't say enough just how awesome our experience was at Hotel Giraffe! Everyone was friendly| courteous and went out of their way to assist us with anything we needed. Best hotel stay ever! Love it.        ,
4,I have stayed at the property many times. One thing is true. Their service is way above par & value is way above par.,Their hotel staff is amazing.  I wish I had all of the names. But Irvan was great before we arrived and Juan was great when we arrived. Spend the extra money and enjoy NYC.  They will leave you with an incredible impression! Look at the value you receive.  Wine & Cheese every night and breakfast in the morning from the friendliest staff imaginable.,
17,The Best of NYC,Stayed with mother and 10 year old daughter as a birthday present for daughter. Staff was so lovely to us. Room had handmade card| balloons| and chocolates waiting for her! Gabriella is a gem and made us feel so special everyday. Jose| Louis| and J.R. also standouts. Really beautiful hotel. Looking forward to next visit.,
93,Outstanding in  Every Way,Based on previous TA reviews| we booked our first time NYC visit here. There is not enough room to say how our stay made our entire trip an 10+ experience - it began before we arrived.  The communication was clear and welcoming| the front desk staff friendly| smiling| helpful. It was my granddaughters 10th birthday and JR personalized her bday card and she loved the balloons and  small box of chocolates that accompanied it. What a memory maker! Gabriella was gracious| attentive and addressed all of our needs at the morning breakfasts and 5-8 time when wine| cheeses| cookies and more were offered.  Laura was great too.The beds were comfortable  with soft luxe linens. Being able to open the balcony door in our room (hearing the sounds of the city) or not when closed was a plus. I…,
25,Great service.,Pros: free breakfast| snack and coffee during the day| free wine&cheese afternoon| not so crowdy area as for NYC| very clean| perfect service at the reception desk and serving breakfasts and wine&cheese in the afternoon| very fast wi-fi| quite and cosy rooms | evening service with relaxing music on!|  Cons: during breakfasts the area of lobby is a bit too small for all guests,
8,Great Boutique Hotel,Very nice property with excellent staff.  I stay in NYC a lot| usually Midtown| but my daughter recently moved to StyTown so we need a hotel closer to Union Square.  Giraffe is awesome!  Nice evening reception (wine and good quality cheeses); really good breakfast and coffee (superb super-automatic expresso/cappuchino/latte machine).  Room was very comfortable| nice bed| linens and bathroom.  I would suggest requesting a 26th Street side room versus Park Avenue for the road noise.  Overall really a really well done property with outstanding service.,
7,Wonderful boutique hotel,My one-night stay here was wonderful. Superb staff| lovely room| delicious breakfast| great happy hour.  A terrific find near Madison Square Park!! I highly recommend the Hotel Giraffe.  You will love it!       ,
15,Home from Home,Having stayed at Casablanca - Elysee and now Giraffe - plus the Aria in Budapest - people make good hotels and the people in every section of the Giraffe hotel were 5 star - the hotel itself was perfectly located| size and amenities but the best staff we have experienced..,
110,Second Visit to Giraffe - Wonderful!!,Our second visit to Hotel Giraffe - its a complete gem in NYC.  All the staff are lovely| so polite and helpful.  Special mention to Gabrielle| she serves the wine and cheese in the evening and is absolutely lovely| tops up your glass with wine which is very welcomed after a full| active day in NYC. We stayed at quite a few hotels in New York State and Washington DC during our holiday - this is heads and shoulders above the rest. Breakfast is lovely - small pastries| bagels| toast| choice of toppings| wonderful fresh fruit| fruit salad and yoghurt.  The rooms can be noisy at night from the street - but you are in one of the busiest cities in the world - is it surprising!!!  We had a double bedded room with a balcony| perfectly adequate for us and our 2 teenagers!   You will not…,
484,Disappointed,I'd stayed with this hotel group in Prague and gave that a rave review so was disappointed to find Hotel Giraffe was overpriced and very average and definitely over-rated. The complimentary breakfast was full of carbs and very limited so we ate elsewhere. The room was disappointingly small and dingy feeling and after complaining about the old bed| we were offered an upgrade but it was well into our stay at this stage. They are apparently doing an upgrade of the beds- but it should never have been allowed to get as bad as it did. We slept with ear plugs as it was also noisy. This was meant to be a special celebration for us and I felt we had overpaid for what we got. The reception and breakfast staff and any employees we met in the elevator were always chirpy and friendly so they…,
155,Wonderful stay!,"We stayed at Hotel Giraffe for five nights and enjoyed every minute! I can confidently recommend this comfortable ""home from home"" and will definitely stay here again when in New York! It is well located| within easy walking distance from the 28th Str subway station| as well as from Madison Square Park and the Flatiron Building. The Empire State and Times Square are also doable on foot| as are Union Square and Greenwich Village.  The staff at Hotel Giraffe are all extremely friendly and helpful| with special kudos to Chris and Coty on reception| and Laura and Anna serving breakfast.  The facilities are great: We stayed in Room 307| which had a private balcony overlooking Park Avenue. The bed was extremely comfortable| the room was spacious and tastefully furnished. Free WiFi was…",
43,Can't wait to stay again,Gem of a hotel in the city.Location fab. Breakfast excellent| all you need to start your day. Cheese & wine a lovely touch. Rooftop bar good. Staff excellent & friendly especially Gabriella. They provide earplugs & eye masks which are helpful for light sleepers like me.        ,
1,Don't look Any Further this is the Place you want to Stay At while in NY,We found a GOLD Mine...from the Hotel to the Staff. Everything!!! was above our expectations. Superb!!! We'll Be Back Hotel Giraffe. Keep up the Good Work| it doesn't get any better than this... Until we see you again....Thank you for a Wonderful Stay,
67,July 2 night stay,We picked Giraffe on the basis on TA ratings and reviews| and our knowledge that NY hotel rooms can be expensive| tiny and disappointing.  Giraffe is really good. The staff were some of the brightest and bubbliest we've seen anywhere.  The designers have made the absolute most of the space ... So they are able to offer the rooftop bar| the cheese and wine| the breakfast| etc in what is in reality quite a small hotel.  The hotel doesn't have its own kitchen| room service| etc. it relies on shipped in produce for breakfast| and on the Italian restaurant at ground level for room service etc.    We opted for a bigger room when booking| and we're glad we did ... It was spot on in terms of space.  We were on a lower floor| but the traffic noise didn't bother us at all unlike other…,
1,Great Hotel!,I was pleasantly surprised with my recent stay at Hotel Giraffe! First| and most importantly| the hotel was very clean. I do always travel with Clorox wipes & Lysol| I only used the Lysol on the remote control (I always do)| otherwise I didn't have to clean at all!  Secondly| everyone from my check in to check out was wonderful. So accommodating| fast service and always with a smile.  The first night I did check in very late| around 3am. When I got to my room I wanted so bad to just go to bed| (I did have an appt at 9am) but the TV in the bedroom wasn't working (I can't sleep without the TV on...) Christian (who was wonderful) did come up & worked trying to fix it with no success. The other issue (or preference I guess) with the room was the bathroom door is glass and although…,
5,Superb| Friendly and Helpful staff in a gem of a hotel in a superb location,Second visit to the Hotel Giraffe in two years and as before the memory you come away with is of the staff in this gem of a hotel in midtown. Great breakfast with fruit and cereal and lots and lots of coffee in the morning and excellent wine and cheese served up in the evening by one among many of the stars our Gabriella. Special mention too for the staff on the front desk as our luggage didn't turn up this trip for two days and they hassled on our behalf.  The location is excellent for trips but don't miss a stroll down to the bustle of the Union Square market on Saturdays or escape to Madison Square Park and chill out. Will definitely be back.,
2,Fun in NYC ,My wife and I and our 16 year old son stayed five nights at the Hotel Giraffe and loved every minute of it. The staff at the hotel were exceptional. The room was spacious (we had the king suite with balcony) and was well appointed. The breakfast has everything you need to get your day going. Can't brag enough about the evening wine and cheese. We can't wait to get back. Great location!!!,
358,Only average,"We were not impressed with this hotel at all. The whole hotel felt very dated| especially the room. The price we paid was excessive for this quality of hotel| even by New York standards and we much preferred the 60 Soho hotel that we stayed at previously.  We love boutique hotels but this seemed like a 3 * rather than a 4 * hotel. The room was rather bleak with a desperately uncomfortable sofa bed. The see through bathroom door was just weird.  Despite the over priced cost of the room| the "" free"" continental breakfast was quite average| although it was good that they provided gluten free bread. We wouldn't return.",
54,great place | nice location,we have stayed here before . staff is wonderful. room very comfortable. the only real complaint is that the bed quilt is too small for the bed. being over 6 feet tall it did not totally cover me. great restaurant in the hotel| breakfast included in room price | very good. also wine and cheese cocktail in the evening. elevators at times were very slow| perhaps due to rooms being cleaned and elevators occupied by staff.,
67,New York City Break in great hotel,Just back from lovely stay at Hotel Giraffe.  Located mid-town so ideal for trips| either to nearby by Greenwich Village and Hudson River Park or up to Times Square.  The rooms were lovely and clean and there's a great roof terrace if you fancy a drink.  The breakfast is great and covers everything from cereal| fruit salad through to pastries.  Lots of tea and coffee along with cold drinks.  Throughout the day you can stop off for a drink or snack where you help yourself.  Something really different is the complimentary wine and cheese put on between 5pm - 8pm| perfect if you need a pick me up.  Very sociable and really connects everyone in the hotel.  Special mention to Gabriella who looks after the wine and cheese and tops up glasses| a lovely lady only happy to help.  Also…,
136,Details| Details| Details!,This is a unique boutique hotel with a good location| friendly| hospitable staff| stylish surroundings| and plenty of extras. Breakfast is included and served daily| there is always iced water| cookies| fruit and pastries on hand| and there is a daily wine and cheese reception that includes a spread of nuts| olives| fruit| and biscuits.  From the moment we walked in the staff were extremely upbeat and essentially bent over backwards to make us feel welcome and meet our needs.  Somehow the gracious and classy hospitality was not what I expected in NYC! The rooftop garden is lovely and also had fresh iced water available and both indoor and outdoor seating areas| lovely plantings and art work.  The rooms are virtually sound proof| have good black out blinds| are  generous size|…,
3,Great long weekend ,My wife and I reviewed several hotel in the area. We settled on the Giraffe and it was the smartest thing. Overall quieter than expected| comfortable| informative and helpful staff. We enjoyed utilizing the small balcony and will hang out on the rooftop next time. The location made it easy to walk all around and cabs/uber found when needed. We will definitely stay here again. ,
13,Couldn't be better!!!!!,This was our first visit to Hotel Giraffe and can't wait to go back!!!  By far it is better than having our own little pied a terre. The staff is professional| knowledgeable and helpful. The room was spacious| exceptionally clean and well appointed. Gabriella| wine and cheese aficionado| is a delight and a true ambassador for the hotel. She supervises the complimentary wine and cheese service.  We visit NYC 5 or 6 times a year and have stayed at many 4 or 5 star hotels. Hotel Giraffe will definitely be our first choice for future visits.,
1,Excellent Hotel!,The Hotel Giraffe is outstanding! Perfect location! The entire staff is friendly and courteous.  Jose (doorman) is always pleasant and helpful. Gabriela  (lobby hostess) pays attention to all guests and really makes you feel welcome. Emily White is responsive and goes out of her way to insure you have a wonderful stay. The rooms are clean and well maintained. Highly recommend.,
289,Our new favorite,I travel to NYC often and usually stay closer to midtown because the conferences attended are located in that area.  My daughter just moved into housing across from Tisch Hospital and in order to help her move we decided to stay somewhere closer to her area.  The Hotel Giraffe fit the bill and then some.  Not only is that area our new favorite location but the hotel offered so many pluses I can't see switching back.  The continental breakfast and newspapers in the morning are a great way to start the day.  The wine and cheese in the evening helps wind down after a day of exploring or meetings.  Every hotel employee was warm| gracious and always helpful.  The desk was never crowded and because the hotel is a small boutique style hotel| the frenetic energy you get at most of the…,
30,Another fabulous stay at the Giraffe,We've been to the Giraffe hotel before| but it has been a number of years and we were so pleased to see that everything is as great as we remembered.  We booked a family suite (basically to suites off the corner of the building with a common front door) that had not one| but two balconies from which we could watch the bustle of Park Avenue blow us.  The rooms were clean and well appointed.  The complementary breakfast was not only delicious| but was more than enough to keep us going through lunch.  And we also took maximum advantage of the refreshments that are available throughout the day.  We stopped back at the hotel throughout the day to cool off with a refreshing| ice cold lemon-water| or to get re-energized with an espresso.    But above all of that| the thing that makes…,
1,What a fantastic hotel!,The Hotel Giraffe sets the standard for excellent service.  Every staff member was gracious and accommodating during our 3-day visit.  The complimentary breakfast and wine/cheese service is a wonderful respite from meals out and a nice way to start and end a day of sightseeing.  The king balcony suite was spotless| roomy| and worked out beautifully for our family of three (our teenager slept on sleeper sofa).  It is NYC so there was street noise on the 6th floor| but the room was quiet enough for a good night's sleep.  I wouldn't even consider staying at another hotel - it was the perfect experience!,
1,A peaceful| welcoming| luxurious oasis in a hustling city!,We picked Hotel Giraffe for our recent visit to NYC because of the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor and we were so happy we did!  It was our family's first visit to NYC| so weren't sure where the best location to stay.  This was perfect| close enough to everything to either walk| get a cab| or take the subway.  Everyone was so friendly and welcoming at the Hotel Giraffe from the front desk crew (always willing to help; give directions| restaurant recommendations| or with whatever we needed!)| the famous wonderful Gabriella who goes out of her way to get to know the guests| even remembering what wine they like at wine and cheese time:)|to the maids and janitor crew equally accomodating and friendly.  Our days were full trying to fit in as much in NYC as we could| so it was so…,
180,It's a wonderful Town.....,This was our first time to New York and we were celebrating my 50th Birthday. We were greeted warmly and shown to our room| which was a disappointment - the lounge view was within the dark inside concrete atrium and wasn't what I'd envisaged at all -  we explained this to Reception and without any fuss we were moved to a corner room on the same floor - which was so light and airy. The beds are so cosy.  If you are on a lower room| some ear plugs might be beneficial| but this is New York and the noise on the street is all part of being in this amazing place.  We loved the location - the breakfast| the wine and cheese| the roof top bar (with limited drinks) was a nice touch. But as others have said a full bar would be wonderful!   The staff are so helpful and nothing is too much…,
11,Great Vibe!,Loved this hotel...fantastic location. Friendly staff. We were in and out of the city for just one night. Had valet parking in a secure garage...worked out really well as we were on a road trip and had bikes| etc...on our car. Comfortable beds. Spacious rooms. Fantastic!       ,
79,Excellent stay,After good e mail responses from the hotel |they were able to follow up by looking after us very well. Good service|good rooms and food. Would not hesitate to stay again. Nice touch to provide cheese and wine in the late afternoon too|,
161,Great Location,Just returned from our visit to New York. We found the location perfect for all the places we wanted to visit. Our room was very comfortable and quiet. The complimentary breakfast was very welcome and the cheese and wine reception equally welcome at the end of the day.,
88,Great value| great service| great staff,We loved our stay at the Giraffe - an intimate boutique hotel on 26th and Park.  The location was perfect| our room was beautifully appointed| the complimentary breakfast was delicious and all day tea| coffee| water very much appreciated.  There is also complimentary wine| fizz| cheese and biscuits for guests between 5 & 7pm.  Gabrielle has been rightly commended in other reviews for her great level of service.  We found everyone at this hotel to be fantastic.  We particularly reserve praise for Chris on reception and José on the door who helped us with every query and were delightful to deal with.  We stayed on the 11th floor which was so handy for the lovely roof garden on the 12th.  A great base for Manhattan - this will be our place to go whenever we visit.,
18,Best hotel I have stayed in in New York,This hotel is just lovely. From the moment you arrive you are greeted really warmly. ALL the staff were so helpful and friendly and I mean everyone| which is so unuasual these days.   We arrived after a flight from Las Vegas in the evening so we were tired and hungry but after asking for a recommendation of where to eat they recommended Sarabeths which was just a few doors down. The food was fabulous!  One of the reasons we chose the hotel was that they provide a breakfast which is very handy when you dont want the fuss of finding somewhere to eat before you head out for the day. This included fresh fruit| yoghurts| cereals| pastries| toast juices| teas and coffees. We were a party of 6| my husband and I and our 2 teenage daughters and my parents and we all found plenty to eat. …,
85,Cosy - Tidy - Comfy - Functional - Convenient,I stayed here on business early in 2015. I had a corner room. Was more like a junior suite. Spacious and had everything I needed. The hotel is conveniently located in Manhattan| walking distance from 'Eaterly' in the Flat Iron area. The hotel does not have a Restuarant| but there are loads of restaurants nearby. They do have a complimentary breakfast spread in the mornings. Boiled eggs| breads| coffees & tea. In the evening they have complimentary beer and dine in the lobby. Staff very helpful. I would stay here again.,
29,I wish I could keep this secret....,.......but the truth is that this is our favorite hotel in NYC!   It's small in the best ways possible - the great staff knows your name and helps you at every turn| great morning breakfast to get you on your way| snacks and wine before you head out for the evening| excellent location to restaurants| Eataly| Madison Square Park| etc. Always clean| comfortable| and smartly appointed rooms await you at the end of your day. ENJOY!!,
17,Trip to NYC,We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Giraffe.  The staff were so polite| friendly and helpful.  Our room was lovely and our room was quiet enough that we could get excellent rest.  The breakfast selections and afternoon wine and cheese spread were a wonderful addition.  The location worked well for us.  We plan to stay here again on our next visit to NYC to see our daughter.,
78,Stop looking for any where else- book to stay here!,Just fantastic. Very clean| great efficient service| polite staff. We ended up staying here longer than expected as a family member was taken ill on our trip. The hotel were very helpful and accommodating with all our requests and room changes. The breakfast is good| fruit| toast| bagels| cereals etc and the 5-8 wine and cheese is lovely. There are some great restaurants on the block and its a short walk to the metro stations either on Park Ave or at the Flat Iron building. Takes about 10 mins to walk to Empire State. Don't miss out on an evening in Madison Garden soaking up the atmosphere and a burger at shake shack. It's quieter on the higher floors and those on 26th street rather then Park Ave. we stayed on floor 8 and also floor 2. It was a little noisier on floor 2 but…,
2,A Very Good Place To Stay,     Upon arrival| the doorman graciously greeted us and took our luggage while we quickly checked in by the very friendly staff.  He went with us to the room| told us about the hotel| suggestions on restaurants| put our suitcases away and mentioned he was there to help at anytime.      The room on the eleventh floor was a nice size by New York standards.  Very comfortable king bed.  They do turn the sheets down at night and leave a couple of mints.      One very odd design in the room is the bathroom door's see-through wavy glass panel.  What designer and corporate heads thought this was a good idea??      I don't need to see my spouse| girlfriend| boyfriend| child sitting on the toilet and the aftermath.  When I mentioned this to the front desk| they said they do have some…,
18,Home away from home..., We were three generations of ladies in NYC for some R&R.  All expectations were exceeded and we enjoyed our time reconnecting and laughing. The location is terrific| lots to see| eat and drink within walking distance. The rooftop in the hotel is a must. Treat yourself to a getaway that will leave you relaxed and rested. Special thanks to JR who made our visit even that much better. Job well done.  We'll be back. ,
12,Would not change a thing!,We loved everything about Hotel Giraffe| from the moment we arrived to the time we left. The staff was amazing| the evening and morning complimentary goodies were wonderful.  We really enjoyed the 12th floor patio as well.  thank you for making our NYC holiday so memorable!,
19,One of NYC's Best Kept Secrets!,We visited this hotel for three nights from July 30th and were pleasantly surprised from the moment we walked through the door. The hotel was very easy to locate; it is on the corner of Park Ave and East 26th Street. If you are driving you will need to enter on East 26th. We stayed in room 1101; it was very clean and well appointed. The room was surprisingly quiet with little to no noise. The breakfast exceeded our expectations. The evening wine reception (from 5:00 - 8:00) was some of our best memories of the hotel; it was a wonderful way to unwind after a long day in the city. Good quality Red and White wine was available as well as an assortment of cheeses and other cold appetizers. And finally the service at the hotel was outstanding; some of the best that we have…,
1,Top rate hotel,My wife and I have been staying here several weekends each year for some time and we are never disappointed in the cleanliness| staff| or accommodations. A great choice for the upper end stay. Just do it!,
281,Lovely Stay- Great Location,Just returned from a great stay at Hotel Giraffe.  Loved the hotel and it's location (close to subway stops| restaurants| and Madison Square Park).  The staff was helpful and friendly- front desk men and women| doormen| maids| breakfast attendants.  Enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and thought the room was wonderful.   Good room darkening automatic shade| pretty balcony with flowers| and numerous pillow options (in the room or available at the front desk).  Two of our nights we had no tv signal and internet was slow- staff said there was a problem with the cable company.  The one night we had the tv working| we found the tv to be of lower quality.  Other than that| everything was excellent.,
31,Friendly service,The room was very nice| but our TV didn't work well. They came to try to fix it without much success.  Satellite/cable issue? The staff was very cordial. The lobby was no frills| but had plenty of beverages and a light breakfast available there.,
88,Wonderful Find,I visit New York a few times a year and was looking for someone I had never stayed. This is a boutique hotel that offers amenities not found ion most hotels. The wine & cheese tasting is great as is the breakfast and snacks available most of the day. I dodo't go to NY to eat at a hotel but having snacks| good snacks available in the lobby's very nice. It is also close to some very good restaurants and bars. It was my wife's favorite hotel in New York. I would agree if it had a full bar| which it does not. The rooms are very comfortable and having a balcony in NY without having to pay mope than 1k/ night is almost unheard of. This is a very good place to stay.,
7,Great hotel - comfortable - good location,Our room was very clean.  Bed was extremely comfortable.  There is a shade that comes down and covers the window making it very dark and quiet.  Slept like a baby.  Rooms have a small lovely balcony.  Happy hour at end of day was great as was breakfast in the morning.  Took our morning coffee up to the rooftop deck.  Staff was very helpful.  Would highly recommend this hotel,
8,10 year anniversary,Hotel giraffe has been one of -if not THE best- hotel experiences we've ever had. From the moment we arrived we were warmly welcomed and taken care of. Upon hearing it was our 10 year anniversary| the staff kindly sent up a bottle of prosecco to our room. They were wonderful in answering questions and giving us tips as we navigated through the city. It was so nice to have fresh fruit| and refreshments offered throughout the day| and the continental breakfast was attended to by more friendly staff. Never been taken care of so well at any other place we've stayed. You won't be disappointed!!!,
172,Great location,This is a comfortable hotel| I would give it 4 starts. Accomodations are roomy| clean| decor is ok| beds very comfortable. Bathroom adequate| no frills. The breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvres were great| although would be nice to have a non-alcoholic drink besides water and coffee. Doorman| front desk very helpful and friendly. Can say enough about the location. Walk to Madison Square Garden| Grand Central Station and the Flat Iron District. In the heart of Indian Restaurants.,
29,Fantastic Choice,We recently stayed here for 6 days| and we were so impressed by the high level of service| the spotless| comfortable (and large for NYC) room| and the welcoming ambience of the hotel. Loved the wine and cheese and continental breakfasts in the lobby; this extra touch made a big difference. Great location too...convenient to all areas of the city and walking distance to many restaurants and cool neighborhoods.,
1,Amazing customer service and more,We have stayed at many hotels in NYC| including Trump Central and Soho (~$1|000/night)| but was blown away by the customer service and extras we received at such a reasonable cost ($375). Upon arrival| the Valet voluntarily suggested we park in free spot he noted across the street to save $50 and still helped direct traffic| took bags| etc although not using their garage. We arrived BEFORE check in yet they gave us a free bottle of champagne for waiting only 15-20 minutes in their lobby while enjoying complimentary tee/coffee/snacks. Rooms are quaint| clean| quiet and balcony a rare extra for being in city. Perfect location. Excited to come back!,
70,A keeper.,Picked this hotel and then later had a friend tell me it's the only place she stays in NY and she was bummed I'd found her gem! It was just great - excellent service| loved the wine and cheese| the rooms was large for NY| quiet!| great location. I think staying in NY just got easier for us on our weekend jaunts bc I don't see a need to stay anywhere else!,
71,"Back ""Home""",We stayed elsewhere in 2013| as The Giraffe seemed to get a bit expensive| but were delighted to return in 2015.  Not much has changed| thankfully.   The feel of the place is still great| some of the same people are there. The addition of the roof garden improves.  All in all| I hope we will be returning for further visits.,
232,Awesome Customer Service !,"Although our trip to New York City (post-cruise) is not for several months (April)| I have spent countless hours ""surfing"" through the various Trip Advisor reviews - to try to find the ""perfect"" hotel for our short stay. (good customer service| nice King Suites| not too  expensive| highly rated by Trip Advisor reviewers| etc. etc. )  Based on wonderful| complete and prompt email responses from Giraffe Hotel personnel| I have decided that the Giraffe is the one !     I know it is unusual to write a review| prior to the actual stay at a hotel| but I felt that the wonderful pre-stay service is something that should be shared.   (P.S. - I will be sure to write an additional review after our trip !)",
209,Nothing's changed!,Nothing's changed| and that's a great thing! We visit once a year and always stay at the Giraffe. In fact| they're so good| they remember our room and always rebook us in it. You can tell allot about a business that retains their employees. The Giraffe seems to keep them all. Friendly and familiar faces are here to greet us where ever we go in the hotel. We really| really like that. There's nothing here to complain about. The beds are great| rooms are silent| food/drink excellent (did I mention no cost) and the attitude is perfect.   Staying here is an easy decision.,
60,Excellent visit at the Giraffe,"Was in NYC on business for less than 24 hours and attending an event at MSG. Chose this hotel based on location and couldn't have been happier! It was walking distance (about 15 min) to MSG and a quick Uber ride to Midtown and Upper East/West side. Small hotel with BIG personality. Many great eateries withing walking distance and of course| the fabulous PARK AVENUE!!! Incredibly helpful front desk staff. Rooms were beautiful and extremely comfortable. Our room overlooked Park Avenue with a small balcony. Free cocktail reception centered around a baby grand piano and pianist. Breakfast was small and PERFECT! Beautiful fresh fruit| bagels| pastries| juices| milk| etc. Loved the ""small"" feel of this hotel and all of the staff were incredible attentive to our every need and really…",
1,Giraffe |  new king of the jungle,In a busy diverse and exiting city| the hotel giraffe offers comfortable unpretentious surroundings coupled with seamless customer service. We had a room on the 12th floor with a balcony that had views of park avenue and Madison park| clicking the switch for the automatic blind revealed classic NYC views. The room had everything you would need and was serviced to a good standard. The inclusive buffet breakfast was really enjoyable and so was the complimentary cheese and wine plus biscuits and nibbles. All staff particularly  the waitresses were very friendly and made our stay here particularly notable. The Flatiron distric is safe| clean with many good shops| restaurants and coffee shops including the fantastic shake shack and eataly. Highly recommended hotel in true NYC speak…,
7,Another wonderful stay,To my surprise| I was greeted by name.The service is great; there is a real and genuine feeling here that I am welcome. I could not imagine staying anywhere else while in New York. Gabriela is truly an exceptional staff member.         ,
6,Love this place,Very comfortable and great service.  In NY it's so nice to have a hotel provide breakfast that you can just grab and go before you start your day.  Our room wasn't quite ready at the time promised| so they gave us a bottle of wine.  Nice way to start our visit.  Was just a bit loud on the 4th Floor.,
22,Good Location for Weekend visit,The standard queen room was very spacious for NYC. We had a balcony that let in fresh air and we could stand out on it for a view of the area. The location for us was exactly what we needed as we were visiting our son who lives in the East Village. We were able to walk to everywhere and the subway is close as well. This hotel is a 25 min cab ride to Laguardia when traffice is moving. It took us an hour in heavy traffic from JFK. The lobby is very comfortable and breakfast is great for a quick cup of coffee and bagel/pastry/fruit/yogurt. The wine and cheese/crackers/veges served in the evening is very nice. These free ammenities are so nice! It was also my birthday while we were staying and there was a bottle of wine in our room| compliments of the hotel. That has never happened…,
28,A gem in busy New York City,The Giraffe hotel is a real gem. Everything you read in the reviews is true. The rooms are spacious (for NYC) and very nicely appointed. The bed is one of the most comfortable we have slept in. A/C is perfect and easy to control. Pressure and water temperature great. Big nice TV with a large selection of channels (but did not have time to watch it).   The hotel is very beautiful. Nice boutique hotel feeling. Beautiful rooftop terrasse. Great spot to relax.   The breakfast is plentiful and very good. All items are fresh and tasteful. The wine and cheese isa wonderful tradition at the Library Hotels Collection. It is so nice to unwind a bit before late dinner after a full day in the Big Apple. You are in your clam and comfortable lobby enjoying a glass of wine and little munchies…,
1,Highly recommend this hotel!!,We stayed here for a weekend getaway with the girls. The staff was very helpful from the time we checked in until the time we left with restaurant recommendations and getting us taxis to our destinations. The rooms were very clean and we did not hear the NYC traffic at any time. Highly recommend this hotel for any NYC trip!               ,
963,Winner winner| giraffe dinner !,LOVED IT... start to finish| we all loved our 3 night stay here. We had a suite on the 12th floor| which worried us at first| as the roof top bar is the same floor. But that closes at 9pm so the worry soon passed.  The room was huge ( 1201 )| living room| bathroom and very large bedroom.  The rooftop bar is lovely| when its not a bar it can be used by guests to sit in bring your own food and drink and enjoy.  The staff are fantastic| smiles all around and on hand for questions questions questions. Free wine/pressecco/cheese daily 5-8pm| is a real nice bonus| not many hotels offer this. Plus all day/night long there is free coffee/tea/water and biscuits| another nice touch.  Great location for the flat iron building/union square. And for you FOODIES| a real bonus is the…,
37,Fantastic Boutique Hotel Near Union Square,I really can't write enough superlatives. Unless you are uber fussy royalty this hotel should more than meet your expectations. Fabulous staff| spotless rooms| great location| free and excellent breakfast| free cheese and wine in the evenings. Zero negatives. Great well run place.,
5,Friendly staff in a great location,Stayed here  in July 2015 - a quadruple balcony room was big enough for the four of us including two teenagers.  Positives included helpful staff| clean and modern room| quiet air-conditioning| free wifi| bonus cheese and wine reception each evening.  We found the location to be great - you can walk to large parts of Manhattan and there are lots of places to eat nearby if you don't feel like going far.  No negatives really.  Yes| the street can be noisy but you're in New York!    Overall| a really enjoyable trip and we would stay there again.,
20,Quiet Location,Just spent three nights in the Hotel Giraffe in New York City. Very modern| great staff and best of all very quiet which is unusual for NYC in my experience. Good location close to the subway and most major sites.,
1,Pleasant Vacation,My husband and I stayed here in July|2015 and I can't brag enough about this place. The staff is fantastic and goes out of there way to make sure this hotel feels like your home away from home! Great location; will definitely come back!,
9,Faultless,As has been posted previously this hotel is perfect. Great location. Attentive and helpful staff. Free breakfast and free cheese and wine of an evening. The hotel itself is spotless. Nothing was too much trouble for whoever was manning the front desk. If I was being uber critical I could say the lifts often took a little while to arrive but that's as bad as it gets. Fantastic hotel!!,
10,Hotel Giraffe - perfect!,The hotel was fabulous. The staff were friendly and helpful. It was in a great location too; very convenient to get around. I would recommend this hotel to anyone| young or old. As long as it fits the budget!              ,
9,Big Birthday Holiday,We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights| Great location and the hotel facilities and staff were fantastic. Think we made a friend in Gabriella who treated us so well at the cheese and wine receptions each evening. This will be our choice of Hotel when we make our next trip across the pond to New York. We really can't thank the staff enough. We will be back,
1,A little gem in Midtown Manhattan,I can heartily recommend Hotel Giraffe in Midtown Manhattan. From the outset the staff were clever and helpful| from the nifty way they make it easy to book and print off Broadway tickets to getting back out to the airport efficiently and economically.  The room was very well appointed| a complimentary bottle of wine to greet you| an excess of comfy pillows (hurray)  to prop on and even a few books in case you might not have enough to do. A complimentary breakfast and a delightful wine and cheese option in the early evening before you head out to those Broadway shows or whatever. A real home from home! ,
2,family tripp,Best ever. Feel like to bee a family. The staff from bottom to top was wonderful. Very nice with the afternoon vine and cheese. The room was nice and the beds was very good. Nice service with new towels and very clean. The breakfast was superb with fantastic service. The lady who was manager over breakfast and vine afternoon was extremely good att service and too give al a nice small every day. Over all we ar extremely satisfied . Love to come back some day.                            ,
1,Great experience,Staff was very helpful and personable. The rooms are very nice and spacious for NYC. The location is not too near the tourist areas but the restaurant scene in the immediate area is very good. The hotel has a great lobby with a good continental breakfast and snacks pretty much all day. A real find - will stay here any time I need to be on the East Side.,
105,An Escape within the City,Hotel Giraffe is all about the details. I booked this hotel for my fiance's 30th birthday. I bought the birthday amenity which includes two cupcakes| balloons| and a bottle of wine.   All of this was a surprise for him and I felt like it was my birthday also!  The night started off with a simple Italian dinner at Bread and Tulips located in the hotel. We had a simple| tasty dinner. The waiter was lovely| patient| and kind. I used my 20% from the hotel to pay for the dinner. I told my fiance that the dinner was his birthday surprise. He seemed satisfied and said he was just happy to be with me on his special day.  As we left the restaurant| we walked alongside the road and I turned to him and said| that is not all I got a room for us in this hotel. His jaw dropped. We raced into…,
128,Trying to keep this Hotel a secret !!!,Could not wait to arrive in NYC to stay at the Hotel Giraffe. As with our last visit the staff was so welcoming and friendly. Our room as usual was clean and comfortable.This visit we had a two room suite and it was perfect.  Morning continental breakfast is delicious and satifying plus the cocktail hour with wine and cheese in the lobby is a great way to start your evening. Terrific location if you do not want the hustle and bustle of Time Square. I would like to keep it a secret just for myself !!!,
5,Location| Style and Service!,We recently stayed at Hotel Giraffe because we were in town for a short weekend with friends. The location at 26th and Park was perfect for restaurants and bars that had more of a local New York feel instead of the tourist side that so many people see. The staff was amazing| especially the Happy Hour girl (not sure of her name| but she was super sweet). The rooms were clean and spacious| and the overall design of the place was in great taste. I have already recommended this hotel to friends that are considering a trip to New York in the future.,
1,Amazing stay in NYC,The staff at Hotel Giraffe was courteous| helpful and extremely knowledgeable.  They made our short stay in NYC an enjoyable one.  The room was clean| tidy and well decorated.  Overall it was a very pleasurable experience!,
29,Excellent location in a great city,Mission: find a NY hotel close to everything: Empire State and the tourist bits| Mid Town| good food and restaurants| transport| shopping| easy subway access to lower Manhattan| East Side| West Side| Central Park - everywhere!!! Relaxing and friendly environment for the family. Bonus: breakfast| all day coffee (almost real coffee)| and a happy hour: a time when sensible adults can plan the following day's activities over a glass of wine whilst nibbling on cheese and biscuits.  Staff are to be cherished!,
93,Repeat visit| still excellent,We stayed here again for five nights in May 2015 in a balcony room with king bed. the room| staff and complimentary breakfast and afternoon drinks and nibbles were excellent. After a day sightseeing| it was lovely to be welcomed back and to relax in the foyer with drinks and nibbles. Thankyou Hotel Giraffe for a lovely stay.,
10,feel like at home,We really enjoy our stay at Giraffe hotel| Its a nice butique hotel| in a little bit less crowded part of manhattan| but close to many attraction|  subway stop is just a blok away| we often used cabs or jsimply walked. Hotel is clean| comfy| not noisy| we slept nice.  everytime we returned back from the city it was like went home| afternoon wine and cheese reception is simply wonderfull| there is a lady  Gabriell| she takes care of you| is very pleasant| talk to everyone| she is one of the reasons why we felt so nice at the hotel.  coffe| tea and water| apples and some cookies are available 24 hours a day in the lobby. Hotel terrace was nice| good for smokers  I really spend a lot of time choosing hotels| but this one is a gem| im really happy that I choosed this one and found…,
1,Great hotel,My friends and I came for a bachelorette weekend. This hotel was absolutely perfect- the service was fabulous| there were great amenities like free wine/cheese and a pretty rooftop bar| and the employees were so friendly and kind to us. It reminded me strongly of a European-style hotel- clean| classy| and personal. I will be back!,
14,An Excellent Find,This is a boutique hotel a little south of midtown Manhattan which really grows on you. Service is warm and their refreshments in the morning (continental style) and late afternoon (wine/cheese so on) are done very well. Their lounge area is a big plus| very inviting| which more than compensates for rooms which might not be as spacious as some would expect. It's a welcoming place and after you stay here for a few days| you would be justified in being somewhat spoiled. (I was here for nearly a week.) Highly recommended.,
2,Great location and great value,Excellent welcome (& pre visit email response from Ashley) Room very clean. Beautiful white bed linen. Balcony| ? Triple glazing on windows shuts out street noise. Complimentary breakfast also amazing| staff super helpful. Complimentary evening drinks| where would you find this in New York? Gabrielle hostess is lovely and everyone is 'very very welcome' we will certainly recommend this hotel to friends. Nothing was too much trouble| ever.,
8,Excellent,Excellent Hotel. Central and Cool Location. Outstanding service all the way. Nothing less.  This is one of the greatest hotels in NYC. For business| leisure| couple or family travel| whatever. Enjoy!!!                                   ,
1,A welcome surprise,I travel often to New York City on business and also have family in the area so I have stayed at a number of good NYC hotels. I had meetings right in the Park Avenue area so I choose The Giraffe more out of location convenience than anything else but I was very pleasantly surprised by the friendly and happy staff and the unusual amenities available. I loved the comfort of my room| the pillow top mattress and many fluffy pillows| the comfortable chairs| big screen digital TV| hundreds of cable channels| the double paned windows keeping the city noise out of my room. But I especially loved the small touches in the room. I loved the Pulitzer winning photos on my walls| the hardcover books in my room| the lovely thick and comfortable robes and plush towels. Honestly it was hard to…,
506,are there really any giraffes??,there sure are - up in the rooftop lounge. but it's more the citylife than the wildlife that you'll want to experience when you stay here. this is one of the four new york library hotel collection properties - all in tripadvisor's top ten of nyc's 464 hotels for as long as i can remember. each one is just a little different from the others but all offer the same friendly welcome and special amenities. i'd stayed in the casablanca hotel and library hotel last year| then the hotel elysee this year. now it was time to get to know the hotel giraffe. i received a particularly friendly welcome| which is always a great way to start a hotel stay.  i had a great room| and was a regular at the complimentary breakfast big enough to qualify as a brunch. again like the other library hotel…,
3,Great stay for friends reunion,Their lobby lounge and rooftop bar are the best.  Free continental breakfast bar in the morning.  Free wine and cheese in the afternoon.  Computer and printer in lobby for guests to use.  Will definitely return.       ,
16,Quality Hotel,Stayed the one night in NYC and was looking for something a bit special. Hotel Giraffe was just the job. Small hotel on Fifth Avenue| a short walk from the Flat Iron building and Empire State Building.  Bed was huge and so comfy. We had a king room with a balcony and were impressed at how good the sound proofing balcony doors were as when open was really noisy with the traffic. Cheese and wine was served in the foyer for guests between 5 and 8pm. Very nice too. A few glasses of Prosecco before we went out for the evening was a welcome freebie. Breakfast was better than expected with a decent choice of quality fruit| cereals etc.  not the cheapest place we've ever stayed but very good.,
1,The Hotel Giraffe...an escape from the urban jungle!,The Hotel Giraffe is centrally located and we were able to walk to most places and it was a treat to return to after pounding the streets of New York! The hotel's staff is genuinely  warm and accommodating and quick to see to your needs. Our room was spacious and modernly furnished. The bed was wonderfully comfy and the bedding luxurious. The breakfast buffet which offered healthy choices was both delicious and satisfying and the evening appies and wine were enjoyed in a soothing piano environment; a pleasant pace and place to be after the hustle and bustle of the city. On our next visit to New York we will absolutely stay at the Hotel Giraffe!,
1,Fantastic Stay,A friend and I stayed at Hotel Giraffe for one week in June.  The stay was fantastic!!!  The hotel was lovely| the staff extremely helpful - nothing was too much trouble.  It was great having a fresh breakfast each day and well as evening drinks. The hotel is well positioned for many great restaurants| tourist attractions and subway stations.  Thank you for a brilliant week!!!,
21,The Perfect City Weekend Get-away!,I stayed at the Hotel Giraffe with a friend. We wanted to experience and enjoyable weekend getaway in the city. The Giraffe did not disappoint! The lobby is beautiful equipped with a bar serving coffee| lemon infused water| cheese and tasty snacks. Our room had a balcony overlooking the city streets and the tulips were in bloom along Park Avenue South. This hotel is also convenient to get to many places and was a straight line to get downtown where we had dinner reservations at Galli. I would highly suggest this hotel the bathroom and beds are also impressive!,
1,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed,What an awesome place to stay and Great location near yummy restaurants and a fun movie theatre| all in walking distance. Ample street parking. This is as good as it gets. I LOVE THIS PLACE. I found this by happenstance when I was looking for a quiet place to get away while I was in town for  work and didn't want to deal with the commute back and forth to my room,
9,Great location| amenities and ambiance!,This boutique hotel is close to a major subway line and centrally located between Central Park and Battery Park. I found it easy to get anywhere in the city. The employees| lobby area and rooms are welcoming and comfortable.I enjoyed the wide array of morning beverages| pastries and fruit as well as cookies in the afternoon and wine and cheese before dinner. I would stay here again in a heartbeat! ,
10,like a giraffe  - a head above the rest,This hotel was fabulous.  The hospitality in the lobby was wonderful with great cheese and wine.  The rooms were spacious and beautifully appointed with nice views.  My special birthday request was in the room as planned and the cupcakes were outstanding with a great presentation.  The roof top which they didn't even mention at the front desk (they should) is beautiful!  The ambiance is wonderful and it would be perfect for a private event. ,
22,Top Marks to the Giraffe,The Giraffe will not disappoint those looking for nice rooms and amenities and above all great service.  We have stayed at this hotel 7-8 times and would always come back to the Giraffe as our first choice in NYC.  The hotel is at 26th and Park| a short walk to Madison Square Park and Gramercy Park| a 15 minute walk to Union Square.  The green line subway stop is two blocks north on Park and can get you to a lot of locations in NYC in a hurry.  This hotel has a continental breakfast in the morning and wine and cheese from 5:00 until 8:00 - even though it is essentially serve yourself the lady who is in charge makes you feel right at home (Gabrielle) and is always checking to see if you need anything at your table.  Their  long time doorman (Jose) is always a pleasure to deal…,
217,One of the BEST Hotels I've ever stayed in!,"We stayed in the room with the little balcony and as soon as they knew it was my birthday they had a bottle of Prosecco for us to celebrate with!  The room itself is beautifully decorated| extremely well cleaned and appointed.  Here's a lovely touch...live plants in the room and flowers on the balcony| gives a real soft homey appeal to the room.   The bed and bedding was sumptuous with roll down blinds and amazing soundproofed balcony doors that literally shut out the city noise.  There is a well assorted continental breakfast with a fantastic ""coffee"" maker that can whip up espresso's| Latte's etc. and it's available ALL day with cookies!  Plus there is wine/cheese in the afternoon which we missed most days as we were out but another nice touch.  The staff....all of them from…",
234,Great Staff| Great Rooms| Great Lobby,We stayed there the 4th of July weekend| Thursday through Saturday| three nights. The| an upgrade| was on the 10th floor| was spotless and quiet. Water pressure excellent. The breakfast was great| nothing hot| but fresh fruit| fruit salad| bagels| muffins| cereal: it was all too good. What I really liked was the lobby was always stocked with cookies| with coffee available. Really a prime place.,
5,A home in New York,We love NewYork| but loved even more that we had this wonderful hotel to come back to at the end of each day. Amenities| services provided| staff and room size were all beyond expectations. Little touches like quality free tea and coffee all day long and free wine and cheese (and olives| nuts etc) at the end of the day enhanced the experience. Just so welcoming and comfortable.              ,
1,Impressive experience,We had great experience in Hotel Giraffe| not only because the good location close to the major view spots and big room with good view and balcony| but impressived by the hotel service. All the staffs in hotel were very nice and helpful which made us feel like home| and we did enjoy the time spending in the bar area. Thank you,
1,Fantabulous!,The hotel staff was incredible. Very nice and extremely  helpful. The accommodations were impeccable! Will stay again next time I'm in NYC.  Also the food was great from the restaurant. The roof top lounge was great also              ,
69,Great Value for all you get,This was my 3rd stay at the Giraffe- and it was fabulous again!  Finding a reasonable hotel in NYC is not easy but this is often my go to place.  This is what the Giraffe has going for it: Location- very close to Madison Square Park/Flatiron District.  Perfect if you want to spend most of your time in Soho|  Union Square|  West Village and Meatpacking Districts. Great shopping and restaurants  are very close by. Size of Rooms:  Plenty of room for you| your friends and your bags!  Bathrooms are a nice size too.  All have good natural lighting.  Free wifi and super comfortable beds. Morning and Evening snacks:  Breakfast bites are great here- hard boiled eggs| yogurts| fruit| pastries| toasted bagels are all available as is all your caffeine needs.  Eat downstairs or take up to…,
5,The perfect spot,The Hotel Giraffe is stylish| spotless| and very comfortable. The location is perfect for getting downtown and uptown quickly. The staff is very welcoming and friendly.   The lobby lounge and breakfast area is comfortable and cheerful.  The bedding is luxurious. I will stay here often!,
245,Lovely Hotel with REAL suites,I researched the web looking for a reasonably priced hotel with actual suites in New York City for weeks.  I found the Hotel Giraffe through Trip Advisor and I’m glad I did.  I travel with my husband and 3 teenage girls.  An actual suite (not just an extra couch next to the bed) is essential for my husband’s peace of mind.  Not only does the Hotel Giraffe offer a true suite| they also offer a combination King suite with connecting vestibule to a double queen room.  It worked perfectly for my family giving us 3 real beds| two full bathrooms and a sitting area that included a pullout sofa.  All this at a reasonable price.  The rate also included the wonderful continental breakfast (easily a $50/day expense for the five of us)| cookies throughout the day (which my children took…,
1,Perfect!,A fantastic stay at a wonderful hotel! We couldn't fault it. The bedrooms were comfortable and spacious and always immaculate on our return after a hot day of sightseeing. Made all the more welcoming following a restorative glass on fizz and cheese in the lobby| generously made available to all guests between 5pm and 7pm. And all served by the friendliest and most welcoming member of staff you could hope to meet. Views from the relaxing roof terrace bar is also a big plus. As for location| you couldn't wish for better. So central and everything is on the doorstep| yet once inside the hotel| it's an oasis of calm. We'll be heading straight back to the Giraffe on our return to New York.,
36,We love Gabrielle !,Stayed here for 4 nights with family. Lovely decorated  room and super comfy beds. All the staff were very efficient and friendly. Gabrielle was great| she made us all very welcome and worked so hard making sure we all had what we needed at breakfast and in the evening while having cheese and wine.  The only down side as I hate light in the room was that the curtains don't quite cover the windows so the facing office lights shine in the room all night !,
159,Perfect location and wonderful staff!,Went for a weekend with my husband.  We had a beautiful room on the 12th floor.   We have been to this hotel quite a few times but this trip reminded me why we keep coming back.   The staff goes out of the way to make your stay perfect.  NYC is expensive but between the rooms| the welcoming staff and the added amenities you feel like it was worth it.   I love the cold water always going in the lobby| as well as snacks and coffee.  It is spotless and the beds are extremely comfortable.  Thank you for another great stay!,
186,Great hotel for our family,Trying to find a hotel that could accommodate our family of seven (comprising 3 kids| 2 parents and 2 grand-parents) was a bit of a challenge| but it was admirably met by the Giraffe Hotel. We were very lucky to get two rooms connected by their own lobby – we could therefore lock the outer lobby door and keep the inside doors open| making it like a large apartment! This was especially great when the wife and I headed out to hit New York’s nightlife| and the grandparents were able to babysit the kids from the comfort of their own room. The location was great| too. We hadn’t stayed at the southern edge of midtown before| but there as plenty around to keep us interested| especially Madison Square Park a couple of blocks away. Plus a Southern BBQ joint| with a jazz bar downstairs|…,
6,Comfortable| Convenient and Friendly,Our room (really a suite) was spacious and clean.  The breakfast in the lobby had anything we would want and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Great location close to the subway and many restaurants.  15 minute walk from Penn Station.,
8,Exceeded all expectations - amazing!!,Every single member of staff surpassed all expectations from the beginning when we saw our first friendly American face when Juan checked us in and sent a chilled bottle of Prosecco to our room right up to the very end when Gaby and JR resolved our airport transfer issues. They even arranged a lovely bottle of red wine for my birthday!!  Nothing was too much trouble and their service delivery was amazing. The breakfasts were sublime; the evening cheese and wine served with such elegance by Gabriella. The bed was like lying on a cloud and the housekeeping staff ensured that both the bedroom and bathroom were immaculate| satisfying even the fussiest of guests.  The location is great for walking North or South and very close to the subway. Shops of all kinds are easily accessible…,
4,Best boutique for sure.,Our getaway trip for three friends to NYC was a success and Hotel Giraffe was the perfect spot for us. Close to the subway and surrounded by great places to eat and drink| we felt close enough to the action without being in the crowds 24/7. Cocktail hour in the lobby or rooftop patio is the perfect way to stage for the evening ahead. Efficient and friendly staff make it a five star experience!,
2,Fantastic Hotel,Was totally impressed.  Best hotel in NY city I have ever stayed at.  Everyone was very nice.  Hotel was clean and the personal service was great. Free Breakfast and wine in the evening. I will always stay here from now on.              ,
6,NYC,This is simply the best Boutique hotel in NYC. Comfortable and quiet rooms; friendly staff and a great location. The  breakfast in the morning is not hot but high quality. Wine and cheese every afternoon is delightful. The piano player in afternoon adds to the charm.  Cannot beat this place.       ,
1,Manhattan Perfection!,The Giraffe Hotel was our weekend get-a-way for the Big Apple BBQ. The hotel was chosen first because of its location one block from Madison Square Park and from the moment we arrive the Giraffe turned out to be a great choice for more reasons the mere location. The front desk crew was very friendly and helpful when we had questions. Breakfast in the morning was fresh and light| and the coffee was just the thing to start the day. One evening we sat at the rooftop bar| very comfy with good music. Drinks were a little on the pricey side but were very well prepared. The room was excellent| bight and airy and the balcony was a big plus. We will most definitely be staying here again.       ,
12,same great service,we love this hotel. the friendly staff and the prompt fixes (a lamp) are notable. however| this trip the coffee in thermoses was weak and tasteless. the espresso machine is usually perfect but this time coffee was not hot enough. rooms are quiet.  the a.c. is perfect.              ,
5,My new favorite hotel in NYC,This lovely boutique hotel is in a great location. The staff were attentive and helpful. The hotel as a whole is clean| attractive| and up to date. We were upgraded to a suite with a small balcony with a great view of Park Avenue. Very clean and a comfy king size bed. There is a nice roof deck bar| wine and cheese every evening| and a nice continental breakfast daily (which really can save you a few bucks in the city). We would stay here again in a minute!       ,
5,Great NYC Hotel,This was our second visit to the hotel| and it was every bit as good as we remembered.  We arrived late at night with no luggage (thanks to our airline!) and the hotel gave us some toiletries and advised on where nearby we could buy anything else we needed.  We had problems with our room lock| but this was sorted very quickly by the hotel.  We arrived back the next evening to find a chilled bottle of Prosecco and a lovely note of apology for our inconvenience.  We had a suite connecting to a double room.  Both rooms were lovely| very spacious| quiet and came with everything you would need.  Breakfast and afternoon tea/cheese and wine in the lobby were great| as were the staff for both. Breakfast in the lobby is such a relaxing way to start the day and it set us up well for our…,
5,Good location| fair price| very clean and stylish,I got quite a large| clean room for a manhattan hotel at a very decent price. The wine and cheese reception was the perfect starter to an evening out on the town. (It certainly helped me curb my bar bill!) Decor was tasteful and building did not seem very dilapidated like many hotels in this neighborhood.,
293,Warm welcome| friendly staff| nice room and close to all Manhattan sites,Our arrival at NY was a small disaster ! Estimated arrival at JFK airport at 19:15| but due to a storm we finally arrived at the hotel at 23:30 after a 2 hours taxi drive and in the rain. The checkin at the hotel could have been an affrighting experience after the jetlag| delay and bad luck| BUT no it was not !!! Very friendly staff| smooth checkin which took a few minutes and an invitation to take a warm tea or coffee with biscuits after settling in. Just fantastic| unique experience as I may say.   We had a King Suite with balcony at the 9th floor. You are in Manhattan and it is quite silent in the room. Separate sitting room and bedroom with convenient shower/bath in the bathroom. Modern equipped and South Park Avenue is one of the wider streets of Manhattan| so the view is…,
23,Rice family experience,Our family of six adults and two grandchildren enjoyed ourselves very much.  The staff were wonderful and very accommodating.  Whatever we needed was provided quickly and efficiently.  The hotel is in an ideal location for shopping and strolling| with a variety of nearby restaurants.  The daily continental breakfast is plentiful| and the evening wine and cheese was most appreciated.  I highly recommend and we will return on future trips to NYC. ,
3,Family stay at the Hotel Giraffe,The accommodations for a family of 4 (with teenagers) was perfect!  The staff was very kind and helpful.  They always had a smile on their faces. The evening wine and cheese hostess was a gem. And the recommendation for a good pizza place was en pointe.,
13,Oasis of serenity in energetic chaos of NYC,Having been recommended to Hotel Giraffe before by a very reliable source| and having stayed there 2 years earlier| I decided to return for a 2 night stay. Hotel Giraffe and staff did not disappoint. As a matter of fact| I was given an upgrade since the room had a sitting area as well as separate bedroom. I love how quiet the interior of the hotel is and the great breakfast plus their cheese and snack time in late afternoon| early evening. All staff were gracious and more than accommodating. Cody| the bellman| was so helpful and everyone at the front desk helped with suggestions that enhanced my visit tremendously| from subway tips to visiting the Met tips. If you are looking for a super nice place to stay to have a quiet rest from the truly exhilarating pace of Manhattan| this…,
2,Great weekend,Wow!! Staying at Hotel Giraffe was one of the best vacations I've had in a long time. The rooms are amazingly quiet even with lovely balconies overlooking the street. Amazing location| walkable to everything| right next to 6 subway line. Will definitely plan to return!,
1,Home away from Home,We brought our newborn son here straight from the hospital and since then the entire staff has treated us like family! Now when we visit NYC we come here for work and pleasure and the experience is always top-notch. From the lobby full of friendly faces to the amazing housekeeping staff -- you just can't go wrong at the Hotel Giraffe! Thank you for always taking such good care of us.                                          ,
144,Comfort|convenient and service,We have at the hotel many times over the years.  The rooms are quiet and comfortable. High rooms are best. Continental breakfast is included. And happy hour with wine also in the evening. The service s very good at the events. The doorman is there for bags and cabs. Close to the subway ,
1,Great overall experience.,I was in NY to move in my daughter for her summer internship and attend a pastry course. The location is so central to anything you are doing in NY and the staff was wonderful about suggestions on where to purchase dorm needs and other things I needed to purchase quickly. The afternoon happy hour is refreshing after a long day in the city. The rooms are quiet| clean and comfortable. I have stayed at one other hotel in this group and they are now my hotels in NY.        ,
1,Memorial Week 2015,I enjoyed the hotel and its staff. Very nice place and people. Thank you| nice lady who poured my wine at the lobby. And also for cleaning up my spilLs two days in a row and laughing about it with me. I had a lovely time at those happy hours. And thanks to the door man who went out on Park in the rain to flag down a taxi for us. ,
1,Great service!!!,Everything was great| the people were very nice and accommodating.   By far made coming to New York a wonderful experience.   I will use them again next time I go.  Subway is just a couple of blocks away and plenty of places to eat.  Can't wait to be back.,
8,Love this hotel,Love love love this hotel!  Rooms were large.  We had had a double room adjoined with a one bedroom suite which was perfect size for a girls trip.  Fabulous breakfast buffet and happy hour spread.  Coffee and cookies out all day.  And right across the street to Shake Shack!     ,
1,Excellent stay!,From the moment we arrived until we departed the service was execellent and our accommodation was comfortable| quiet and well serviced. We stayed in a king suite with balcony which we would definitely recommend. It had a shower over bath| huge king room separate to a lounge room. There were TVs in both rooms. Free tea| coffee and snacks are offered in the foyer.       ,
1,Great weekend!,Our service was exceptional| in particular Jose was gracious| attentive and personable!!! The complimentary breakfast and wine and cheese cocktail hour were a very nice touch       We would definitely stay here again!                            ,
72,Great hotel,We have been staying here many times. It is a boutique hotel like in Europe. The room are good size bot not very big. They have good breakfast and wine and cheese snack in the evening. Although the seating is limited and you some time have to wait for the seat especially in the evening.  The service at the breakfast and wine and cheese were excellent.  Other service were acceptable.  We will stay here again as it is better than Marriot.,
151,Brilliant hotel,Myself and 2 friends stayed at this hotel on a high floor with balcony. It was a very comfortable room with all the amenities you would require for a 4 night stay. It is fairly central with only a 10 a 15 minute walk from the Empire State Building and Madisson Square Gardens. The breakfast is included in the price. Also there are complimentary drinks and nibbles on a evening. I would defiantly return to this hotel and recommend it to all my friends. Thank you for a lovely stay.,
2,Nice Boutique Hotel but lower floors a bit noisy,Overall| a nice hotel.  Spacious (for NYC)| nice room.  Very clean.  Service was very good.  Not luxurious like some of the top hotels in NY| but a nice boutique hotel.  I was on the 4th floor so it was a bit noisy for me.,
7,Fantastic trip to NY,From the moment we arrived the staff at the giraffe hotel went out of their way to make our trip memorable . From the spacious clean rooms | great location | tasty breakfast | amazing staff| complimentary wine & cheese evenings ( prosecco also ) we couldn't fault this hotel ! We will definitely be returning !       ,
2,Oasis of comfort,Very comfortable room and so nice to have wine and cheese out| or the delicious breakfast in the lobby. My daughter and I were spoiled by the excellent service. The decor was understated and tasteful. It was a treat to stay there.              ,
2,Great stay,Great stay. Enjoyed the rooftop bar and the breakfast. Will definitely come back. A great place at a reasonable price        We have always stayed in the neighbor hood when we come to visit and plan on making the Giraffe our permanent home away from home  ,
12,"My New ""Home"" When in New York City","Bright| inviting lobby.  Pleasant| enthusiastic staff.  A spacious| inviting room.  Extensive| healthy breakfast selections.  Afternoon wine tasting and roof-top cafe.  The very definition of ""Welcome home!""              ",
5,Wondeful| relaxing stay close to busy city!,We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Giraffe and found the staff wonderfully kind and helpful! We slept almost too well in the comfortable bed and especially appreciated having a fresh breakfast available every morning before heading out to our sightseeing.,
2,Best boutique hotel experience!,Loved| loved| loved the Giraffe! Beautiful rooms| great location| charming staff| the best wine/cheese event every evening| continental breakfast included and served in a charming lobby. We couldn't wait to come back and we hadn't even left!,
40,Short Stay-Big Praise,Rainy outside-but all smiles and big welcome as we started our all too brief stay at NYC's Hotel Giraffe. Room was upgraded (our anniversary) and what a room -plenty of space| large comfortable bed and best yet a balcony. Reason I chose to stay here was the promise of music at the wine and cheese reception. Neither the music-or the delicious edibles  and people we met disappointed-in fact my husband had to pry me out of my chair so we could go eat dinner. Wish we could have stayed another night.,
159,Favorite Hotel so far in NYC!!!,We have stayed at numerous boutique hotels in NYC (including some of the Giraffe's sister properties) and Hotel Giraffe has now become our favorite!  It's located in a great location with beautiful| spacious rooms.  We loved the hotel roof top bar and the breakfast and wine & cheese hour were a nice treat.  It has some wonderful restaurants within a few blocks that we really enjoyed!!  The hotel staff went above and beyond in every request we had so we will definitely be returning to this gem!,
226,Third stay at this great hotel,We love this hotel. The staff is very welcoming and helpful. You really feel spoiled when you are there. The rooms are a nice size for NYC as are the bathrooms. The rooftop terrace is nice when you want to sit outside and have your wine or breakfast. The wine/cheese hours are a fabulous touch. It's a great way to have a little break after being in the city all day and before dinner. We love where it is located. We could see a corner of Madison Sq Park from our room.  We will continue to stay here whenever we can.,
168,Our NYC Home away from Home,We LOVE this hotel...as did our 12 y/o granddaughter.  Where to begin to rave?  The lobby:  inviting| bright| orchid-bedecked| well-designed for small groups helping themselves to the daily delights of continental breakfast| afternoon wine and cheese| lemony water.  The rooms:  each with its own accessible balcony| subtle and artful| very non-hotel-like in its soft browns| frosted doors| natural wood| and mirrors that enlarge its corners.  Location:  perfect for long walks around the surrounding streets or accessing the multiple nearby attractions by subway.  Staff:  young| polite| and truly accommodating.  A wish list:  (beyond wanting to spend much more time there!):  in-room coffee and ice machines on the floors| and someone actually playing that piano in the lobby..but those…,
76,Perfection,This hotel is about as close to perfection as you can get in NYC.  The service is impeccable| the rooms are very nice| and the location is excellent (near subway| Madison Park| the Triangle Bldg - close enough to the NYC action| yet far enough that it is quiet - well quiet for NYC).  Breakfast was great| and wine and chees in the evening was a nice touch.   The hotel is expensive| and reservations can be difficult to get - but it's worth it.   There are certain times of the year when the room cost drops noticeably - grab a reservation then and plan your visit around the Giraffe!,
1,Absolutely LOVED our stay at Hotel Giraffe !,My husband and I took a 5 day trip to NYC over memorial weekend. Our stay at the Hotel Giraffe was fabulous.  The hotel staff was outstanding| our room ( a corner suite)  was spacious and the bed was amazing !  The breakfast and afternoon wine and cheese that the hotel offers was MUCH more then I had expected.  The location was great | so close to amazing restaurants and night life.  With the help of the staff - we were able to find our way around the city with no problem. We also enjoyed sitting on the beautiful roof garden in the evenings enjoying the city sky.  We will definitely stay with them again !,
29,Best hotel experience I've ever had in NYC,I travel every week for work| and sometimes for fun too. This was one of those fun trips. 3 nights in NYC after 10 days in Paris. I have to say| this was quite a way to return to the US.  The entire staff at Hotel Giraffe goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. The breakfast was lovely| as was the evening wine & cheese reception| complete with someone playing jazz on the grand piano| and did I mention the breakfast| wine & cheese and 24 hour espresso and tea station are all FREE? The icing on the cake? We booked this 2 days before on Hotel Tonight| so our room was half-price. Even though the front desk knew this| they still upgraded us to a corner suite. AMAZING experience. Love this place. We will be back...again and again.   Almost forgot to mention...great location.,
4,25th Wedding Anniversary,We chose Hotel Giraffe for our stay in NYC this year as we wanted a special treat and we love the area around Madison Square Park. The hotel did not disappoint and lived up to all our expectations. All the staff were brilliant from the time we entered until the time we left. Wine hour was amazing and Gabriella made sure our glasses were topped up regularly. We will definitely be returning. ,
5,Great boutique hotel.,My favorite place to stay in NYC.  The rooms are spacious. Service is outstanding.  Love the amenities as well. Great location. Really like the breakfast in AM; the wine and cheese in the evening as well as the music.         ,
11,Great location| great rooms and great service!,The central location of this hotel puts a number of attractions (such as Empire State Building| Times Square| Flat Iron Building) within easy walking distance| although the subway is nearby too. The hotel has good-sized rooms| some with balcony| pleasant staff and a nightly wine & cheese spread. There's an informal Italian restaurant in the hotel and opposite is the notable 'Upland' Caifornian-style restaurant which is one of New York's finest (so it follows that reservations in advance are an idea).,
12,Great hotel but a little basic,Stayed here for a business trip with several clients.  Nice hotel.  Ashley was great!  The snacks in the lobby were great as well as the daily wine reception and rooftop deck.  I'm not sure it was enough of a memorable experience though for the price and to go back.  The rooms are also kind of dark with all the browns and reds.  Not bad.  Nice hotel.  Just a little expensive and bland.  ,
1,Great experience as usual,Friendly| helpful and responsive staff Quiet| spacious & comfortable rooms Happy hour from 5-8pm Great location Very clean rooms  Overall| the hotel is a cozy one| quiet| in a perfect location and that provides top tier service!,
51,Maybe better than The Casablanca?,Our last NYC stay was at the Casablanca which we rated very highly so thought we'd try a similar style of accommodation as opposed to the usual large impersonal hotels. First impression was good| friendly service on check in| bags straight to our room and a really good sized room| the bathroom separated our lounge and bedroom| but note we were in the king suite that had its own balcony. Everything in the room was very good| the bed was excellent and very quiet rooms away from the traffic. Good continental breakfast with great service and we can't say enough good things about Gabriela who hosted the evening happy hours| her service is exemplary. Good things don't come cheap but like the Casablanca| Giraffe is a cosy| classic haven of boutique happiness| away from the crowds but…,
1,Great hotel,Convenient location near subway| friendly and helpful staff| happy hour with free drinks and snacks for the hotel guests| spacious rooms| nice roof terrace| scale of the hotel - it is not a huge 'hotel-factory'. You can hear street noises (this is NYC!)| but to me the sound isolation of the rooms was well enough. Just a minor point: there was at times a (short) waiting time for a free table at the breakfast room.,
1,Hotel Giraffe is a great place to stay in NYC,We enjoyed seven nights in this excellent hotel.. The staff were so helpful and friendly - nothing seemed to be a problem| We appreciated the free all day drinks and snacks and complimentary wine and cheese at 5pm ... Great location| very relaxed atmosphere in such a busy city - all adds up to the ideal spot for visiting NYC!!!,
111,Great room and excellent service,We had a king| balcony room and found it to be quite roomy| clean and comfortable.  The staff were friendly and knowledgable about where to eat| what to see| etc. In the evening| there is a delightful wine and cheese reception and a nice| but not overwhelming| continental breakfast.  Gabriella| who was working at the wine and cheese reception| was so sweet and friendly.  We were worried about the sound as we looked out on Park Avenue| but the windows must be almost sound proof as it didn't bother us at all. Elevators were a bit small and slow| but that's the only downside. Would stay here again.,
218,Quite a nice find in NoMad,Once again the reviews on Trip Advisor were spot on! In town for a short visit to drop off our daughter for a summer internship| we selected The Giraffe based on location using the 'map' selection tool. Located on the east side of Park avenue all the rooms look out over then historic Armory building.   The lobby sets the stage for your stay| nicely appointed with large windows on two sides make it a nice place to sit anytime of day. All the staff are young and extremely professional| balancing sophistication| poise and authentic engagement to make your first moment truly enjoyable. It is obvious this establishment has taken cues from the best hotels in Europe and created a unique one-of-a-kind hotel in New York.   We stayed in room 601| which had a separate sitting room with a…,
366,Excellent Family Choice,Our family of 4 (2 adults| 2 children aged 12 & 15) spent 3 nights here in April.  We chose this based upon a friend's recommendation. While the room was a bit cramped for the 4 of us| we were very happy with our choice.  The hotel is very quiet and the room was very clean (and beds comfy).  The bathroom was very large.  The staff were all extremely friendly and the free continental breakfast and the wine & cheese reception were great - especially with kids.  The location of the hotel is very good with the subway only a block or two away.  We will definitely return again to the Hotel Giraffe.  Our only negative was how long it took to get our car when we were leaving.  They apparently valet park the cars at a remote site (with a remote car company) and it took us more than an…,
9,Generous Hotel in an Expensive City,I stayed at this hotel for one night| with a group of women in three rooms. I was pleasantly surprised by the staff's warmth and competency from the beginning until the end.   Emily made arrangements easy to workout throughout the planning process.                              ,
305,Quality Hotel with very friendly staff.,Quality New York Hotel in an excellent location for all the City attractions. Very friendly and helpful staff| especially JR on reception and Gabriella on the wine and cheese. Also a big thanks to Katelyn for setting up my wife's cake and balloons. Spotlessly clean. We had a King Suite which was spacious and nicely decorated. Large comfy bed. Turn down each evening. Good views from the roof garden. Breakfast was adequate| served in the lobby| but due to the small selection got a little repetitive after 5 days. An onsite bar would be an advantage. Overall a great experience| expensive| but it's New York| so you get what you pay for.,
1,Excellent little gem of a hotel,I stayed here with my adult daughter and it was fabulous. The staff are very friendly and  accomodating and welcoming . It is a smallish hotel and the staff knew us personally. The rooms were nice and clean. The free wine and cheese every night was a lovely touch. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay here again.,
43,Great service and location on lower east side,"This is a small boutique hotel. The staff went out of their way to accommodate us. Our room faced a building with extremely bright lights at night and there was a 2"" gap in the electric shade so the light shone directly in our eyes when we went to bed. We didn't sleep well as a result and asked for a different room. None were available but the engineer duct taped some material so the entire gap would be covered. They really went the extra mile to make sure we were happy. They also have a lovely continental breakfast included and a complimentary wine and cheese happy hour for guests. It was very nice and again the staff was attentive and eager to please. I would definitely stay there again.",
37,Nice boutique hotel with a lot of finishing touches ,Stayed here only one night but enjoyed it. Great boutique hotel with customized service| comfy beds| and spacious rooms. Intimate setting and complimentary breakfast and wine hour.  Would definitely recommend! The service is exceptional.,
24,Wonderful hotel option for NYC!,Hotel Giraffe is just the hotel that I have been looking for for my frequent business trips to NYC.  Great location| good price for experience| wonderful lobby that offers free breakfast and wine/cheese in the evenings.  Very nice staff as well.  Highly recommend!,
7,Wonderful stay for bachelorette party,What a wonderful experience! We booked 2 adjoining rooms for 6 of us attending a bachelorette party in the city. Our rooms were on the 6th floor....picture walking through a wide door| and then to the left a room with 2 doubles and a small balcony. Straight ahead| a small sitting area with couch| chairs and another balcony..... around the corner a king size bed. PERFECTION. Plenty of room to get ready| and lots of pictures in front of the french door to the balcony. It was raining| so we were not able to enjoy the roof top bar. However| we took a look| and it would have been great-comfy with pretty cushions on lots of benches. We did stop at the lobby for wine| cheee| etc. VERY nice. Manager| David| was great to work with ahead of time. We also walked about 10 steps around the…,
204,Fantastic Flatiron Gem!,Hotel Giraffe is a fantastic boutique hotel just outside the Flatiron District.  A block from the beautiful Madison Square Park and minutes to so many great food destinations like Eataly and the original Shake Shack| Hotel Giraffe is the perfect spot to call home during your visit to NYC.  The staff is so genuinely friendly and helpful you might wonder if you are in New York--unless you know the secret that New Yorkers are actually a friendly bunch.  The level of service you will encounter here is on par with a five star luxury property.  Your room includes a lot of valuable amenities:  a daily wine and cheese reception in the lobby| a beautiful rooftop garden/lounge| WiFi| extensive cable TV| and a generous continental breakfast spread that includes fresh| real NY bagels as…,
19,What a treasure!,This hotel went above and beyond.  I could not believe the service - top notch.  I felt like a VIP.  The amenities make this hotel totally worth it!  The evening wine and appetizers was better than expected - included Prosecso and lots of good appetizers.  We were even served at our table.  The free WIFI and continental breakfast are huge cost savings.  I loved the breakfast and the 24hr coffee/tea/snacks in the lobby.  We were going to a Wedding at the Gramercy Park Hotel and so glad we decided to stay at the Hotel Giraffee.  We will be back!!,
32,Fantastic Hotel - Great Amenities,"At first I did not consider this hotel because it was way out of my price range. Then I found an unbelievable deal on my mobile device for it. It was through Expedia and it was a ""mobile run of the house"" deal. This hotel is unique because it has a lot of things you won't find at a typical down town NYC hotel included in the price. You get a continental breakfast| wine and cheese reception with live piano music in the evenings| and many rooms have Juliette balconys. The room was decorated beautifully| very clean| and large. We were given a queen bed with a balcony which we did not expect since the deal we had was for whatever was available. Our room was directly across from the elevator and we did not hear it at all. The customer service was also fantastic. We came straight from…",
26,Very nice experience in NoMAD area,Location is great| close to Flatiron and Union Square and very close to the subway (about 2 blocks for the 6). Rooms are clean and quite spacious by New York standards and standard for the price range internationally (we've seen quite some stuff). Beds are good| room isolation is good as well (don't expect total silence in New York). Breakfast is basic (no buffet) but wine in the afternoon is a nice experience (also to meet other guests). Staff is very nice and polite. I would definitely consider coming back here next time and would gladly refer this to friends and family.,
11,Excellent Experience,My 1st time in NY and everyone had told me not to expect too much from the hotels. However this was recommended by good friends and how right they were. Fantastic location for exploring all of Manhatten. Room was very spacious and clean. Staff were lovely and extra helpful. The 'cheese and wine' in the afternoon was much understated in the hotel blurb. We made the best of it each day| either when we returned from an exhausting day sight seeing or as a pre-amble before the main evening's entertainment. All tourist questions and queries answered| amazing restaurants recommended and all transport arranged. Brilliant! I will only stay in this hotel when visitng NY.,
16,My Absolute Favorite Hotel in N.Y.,Beautiful rooms| many with balconies! Fresh renovated rooms with a classic touch and a wonderful feeling| that takes you back in time... In the afternoon - all guests are invited to enjoy a free glass of wine together with some cheese| in the lobby| and listen to classical live music in the background.  The service of the staff is just excellent and full of kindness! They will do anything to make you happy! The location| is really close to everything| surrounded by a lot of different restaurants and shops| within the distance of just a few steps! We can really recommend this hotel| and it will give your NY-trip the perfect atmosphere! ,
2,A wonderful stay,Recently spent 8 nights at the Hotel Giraffe with my daughter.  The hotel is in an excellent location - walking distance to midtown| Greenwich Village| East Village and close to two subway stations.  The room was furnished beautifully and the housekeeping was excellent. We stayed on the fifth floor and did have some traffic noise (nothing unusual for New York) but not enough to disturb our sleep. Our room was spacious and extremely comfortable.  The staff are all wonderful| but I would like to make special mention to Gabriela who hosts the wine and cheese evenings.  Gabriela helped to make our stay very special.  She is an absolute asset to this hotel.  I will definitely stay at the Hotel Giraffe again.,
171,Excellent Decision,"On a previous trip to NYC we went to find the Giraffe and were impressed with the greeting we received and the look of the ground floor area. With this in mind we decided to book when we returned to NYC this year. Having visited the city quite a few times we consider the location to be excellent especially if you are intending to ""do"" the sights as a lot of things are in lower Manhattan and it's only a few blocks up town to three of the must sees which are Grand Central station the Rockefeller Centre and the Empire state Building . The reception area at the hotel is not immediately obvious but staff are always friendly and helpful. We stayed in a King room which for NYC was quite spacious beautifully maintained and furnished. The availability of hot drinks all day is a bonus and…",
7,Fabulous stay!,We stayed as a group of friends in Feb. Hotel was lovely| very comfortable. Breakfast was really tasty. Wine and cheese in the evenings with the lovely Gabi. What a fantastic member of staff. Reception and door staff really helpful and nothing was too much trouble. can't wait to go back.,
6,Holiday,Everything about this hotel is excellent. We would highly recommend it. Plenty of restaurants| coffee shops| bars and shops easily within walking distance. Staff were very helpful and the hotel had a very friendly| comfortable feel.                ,
5,Hotel Giraffe | a great place to stay in NYC,Stayed for 9 nights. Great hotel| great room. very clean| friendly and help full staff who provided a personalised feeling to our stay. Great extras provided| breakfast| drinks biscuits| fruit etc all day and cheese and wine in evenings.  Would reccomend to anyone and have already to many people.,
3,Great hotel in Flatirons District,We usually stay uptown but decided to try the Flatirons District.  This hotel is excellent.  Nicest place we have stayed in NYC.  Staff is outstanding.  Breakfast is perfect and the wine and cheese is delightful. Had the Junior Suite and it was great for three people. Great neighborhood and easy to get around.,
9,Upmarket boutique,We have just had a lovely five days at this lovely hotel. Our room was beautifully presented very chic| clean and spacious.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful or friendly.  We appreciated the free all day drinks and snacks and complimentary wine and cheese at 5pm.  It was also a bonus to have a gym pass and video library at our disposal.  The hotel is also very well located mid way between uptown and downtown Manhattan.  The only two small negatives was that there was no literature in our room telling us about the complimentary facilities and we only knew of them through trip advisor and secondly the roof top terrace was often out of bounds for private parties with no bar facilities on the terrace.  I would definitely return to this hotel.,
81,Home away from home,This hotel continues to be my absolute favorite place to stay in NYC| primarily because of the personnel. From the greeting by the charming doorman Jose as I walk in to seeing all the friendly professional young people at the front desk..I would highly recommend this hotel. It is near Madison Park and easy to get anywhere in the city from Park Ave. The rooms are large by NYC standards (and it is nice to find a hotel offering rooms with 2 double beds and large suites ~ hard to find in the city) and the free breakfast and wine/cheese happy hour make the stay even better. In the 4 years that I have been staying here| every employee knows my name and I feel completely at home. The employees at The Giraffe make the hotel a special spot.,
116,Top-notch location and fair price,Enjoyed my stay. Great location| near green and yellow subway lines. You can also walk to Union or Herald Square. Great surprise to find that their toiletries were from Natura. Loved that they were able to accommodate me in a high-floor room| as requested. Balcony is a great plus to get a feel of the busy city| and when the door is shut so does the noise. The black-out works pretty well. Most importantly| I felt like I was at a boutique hotel| where little details count and the guest's privacy is essential. ,
7,Excellent Stay,Great stay at Hotel Giraffe. Staff very pleasant and welcoming. Very relaxed atmosphere in such a busy city. Onsite restaurant (bread and tulips) well worth a visit. Will definitely return to Hotel Giraffe!                ,
1,Fabulous experience at Hotel Giraffe,My daughter and I had a perfect hotel experience at Hotel Giraffe| recommended by a family friend.  Love the personal attention throughout the stay from the staff... am totally recommending.  Honestly| the best!               ,
7,Lovely relaxed small hotel,Loved it. V relaxed| unstuffy. The eve cheese and wine a great and welcomed touch. The roof top terrace an added bonus. Rooms average but staff very polite and attentive. Highly recommend if you are not looking for luxury and are pretty self-sufficient and just want to chill in an unpretentious down-to-earth but comfortable estsblishment. Go giraffe! ,
2,Perfect stay. Great staff| lovely room some nice touches,We booked 3 balcony suite rooms for a party of 5. superb communication from the hotel via email and everything arranged for a pickup from JFK. We requested some of the treats such as strawberries dipped in chocolate for 1 room| prosecco for another and wine for ours. All were there waiting in the correct rooms. Daily cheese| olives and nibbles with wine was perfect to start the evening with and the breakfast buffet had plenty to choose from including fresh fruit| yogurt fruit juices| fresh rolls and pastries. Unlimited tea| coffee throughout the day came in handy after a morning up the Empire State. The area seems safe| some nice restaurants close by and deli for lunches| smoothies etc. street is quite busy but no problems with noise unless you're a very light sleeper in which…,
22,Lovely Hotel but could be great,The Giraffe is a lovely hotel and the staff very helpful.  It could be a great hotel if they added a bar and a kettle in the rooms!  There is a lovely roof terrace but you can't order drinks to be served there.  There is a complimentary breakfast from 7 which is great but sometimes you just want to make a cup of tea before you are dressed and the lack of a simple thing like a kettle seems very odd.,
1,Faultless,We enjoyed three nights in this excellent hotel.. The staff were so helpful and friendly - nothing seemed to be a problem ... Great location| lovely bright rooms| perfect breakfast- all adds up to the ideal spot for visiting NYC!!!,
21,A Birthday Celebration,We were there for a daughter's birthday celebration and it could not have been better.  The room was beautiful| wonderful breakfast| wine and cheese but most of all|  staff and service| outstanding.  I would highly recommend Hotel Giraffe and will definitely return.,
1,Very good overall - NO compaints = wow!,Well| beds we're very confortable. Staff very helpful. Nice location. Good for walkers. Breakfast was super. Wine and biscuits was great before diner. Staff very friendly overall. Will go back. Great way to see New-York.,
4,great stay in nyc.,hotel was amazing.  lovely. clean| well appointed| nice touch to have yummy treats in the lobby all times of day. love that lemon water and cookies for late night snack n the way up to the room. originally from there and go to nyc often to visit family and would make this my first choice.  in fact| wanted so much to stay here memorial day weekend but the prices shot way up out of our range:-( and there was little availability| a huge disappointment. just remember to ask for  your car way in advance.  there was a long wait!,
1,Girls night in the city!,Our rooms were lovely| clean and refreshing to wake up in. We loved the small but inviting terrace. The chocolates awaiting us were also a treat. Wine and cheese evenings and croissants at breakfast were the icing on the cake.                                                                           ,
1,Best Experience in NYC!,This is the best hotel I have stayed in in the city! The service is warm| efficient| and genuine (no overly sycophantic platitudes here). I love the complimentary coffee| tea| and lemon water| and the excellent continental breakfast (who even does that anymore?!). The rooms are spacious| comfortable| and there is a welcome serenity at Hotel Giraffe that provides an ideal respite from the nonstop madness that goes along with any visit to Manhattan. Forget The Plaza! Let's support the Library Collection. ,
40,Great job,"This hotel is proud of their review rank and is clearly keen on maintaining high review scores. I support this as the only way to do that is to hear the positive and the negative. Rooms are spacious for New York| very clean which is hard to find even at 4 star level hotels. Amenities are plenty and useful. They provide for example on request shaving cream amenities which is gracious and understanding of a fellow traveler. Breakfast is not big| something to work on| but the selection is top quality and the coffee is very delicious| hence good job| keep up the good work. No gym| but was explained they can facilitate a few blocks away option. For a hotel to have a no ""no"" attitude deserves a five star rating from me even if they are a four star hotel. Attention is paid to the…",
9,First time in New York,I would highly recommend Hotel Giraffe. The staff were fabulous and in particular the concierge| Chris| who was so helpful in booking restaurants that we were keen to try. The beds were amazingly comfortable and the location of the Hotel is superb. Will definitely be staying at the Hotel Giraffe when next we are in New York.,
8,I love the Hotel Giraffe!,Great location| the staff is friendly and attentive| rooms are attractive and spacious.  I like the small suite with a couch| lots of closet space for suitcases etc.  The continental breakfast and wine and cheese are perfect AND a great restaurant adjoins when you are exhausted from the day and just want to relax at night with a great meal.  This is about my 10th stay at the Giraffe and I can't imagine staying anywhere else!,
3,First trip to NY,Highly recommend Hotel Giraffe.  Staff great.  Amenities fantastic.  Location great for our needs.  Wine and cheese and Continental breakfast were great.  Love the cappuccino machine.  Would stay there again.,
106,Outstanding service and location,Everything has already been said on this tremendous hotel: exceptional location| top class service| wonderful terrace| wine & cheese session. The only small drawback is that you can hear the noise of the street in the rooms. What is impressive is the staff dedication to make your stay so wonderful. This is true even for the top management. I had an issue and I reached the hotel's general manager M. Peter V. by email about this. He took time to check my request| to provide an answer and moreover to call me to exchange on my question. This is real care of customers! I strongly recommend this hotel.,
8,They earned a repeat customer.,My wife and I travel to NYC once or twice a year. This year we took our 5 y/o son for the first time. We normally stay in Midtown. We like the Warwick there| but this trip we wanted to get out of such a touristy area. Hotel Giraffe seemed like a nice fit| and it was in the top 10 NYC hotels.   The hotel is outstanding and deserving of the other positive reviews. Great staff| comfortable room| etc. Some things set it apart from the other NYC hotels. First| the area has several great restaurants nearby| including the one in the hotel. Second| the steady stream of coffee and complimentary breakfast saves you an incredible amount of time and money. Our son enjoyed playing at the nearby park. Finally| free WiFi is harder to come by in the nicer NYC hotels for some reason| so that…,
277,The Right Hotel,It is always so difficult to find just the right hotel| no matter where in the world one goes...the Giraffe was definitely right for New York City. We have now stayed in three of the Library Collection hotels: Casablanca| Library and now Giraffe. My compliments to the owners for hiring some of the best staff. The friendliness and courtesy of ALL staff is to be commended. You add the right rooms| location and amenities for a NYC price and you feel you have chosen correctly.  As this was a family vacation| we needed a bit more room| which the two room suite provided comfort. Yes| the second bed was a sleeper sofa| but our son felt it comfortable and had fit sleeps (He also slept with the french window slightly adjar without problems...wish I could sleep like that).  As almost…,
119,Excellent choice near Madison Square Park,A great stay at this lovely boutique hotel. Nice| clean room| friendly and helpful staff| wonderful breakfast and cocktail hour daily. Close to bus and subway stops| Empire State Building| Madison Square Park| Eataly food emporium| Chelsea Market and High Line| and Union Square with its greenmarket. The only drawback was the noise level on Park| but NYC is going to be a noisy city both day and night| so that is to be expected. If you're a light sleeper| request ear plugs or a room on the 26th street side.,
190,An Enjoyable Visit to NYC,I booked this online and then I emailed the hotel and requested a room with two beds. The Hotel responded quickly and fulfilled my request| I also requested an extension to my stay and they were able to accommodate me in a suite.   The Hotel is in a great location and the subway is nearby.Union Square is within walking distance.  The breakfast is sufficient but space within the dining area can be limited. The wine and cheese adds a nice touch after a long day in the city. The staff were all wonderful and I would definitely stay at this hotel again| the accommodation was good| the area was good and the price was right! What more could one want?,
77,Great location| great facility and friendly staff,This was our first stay at this hotel| but not our last.  Hotel was clean| safe and very nice accommodations for an exceptional price for New York.  It was within very reasonable walking distance to the subway and several parks.  Several nice restaurants very close.  Staff was very friendly.  Really enjoyed the complimentary wine and cheese in the evenings.,
9,Delightful and perfect for our trip.,This hotel is in a great location| staffed by friendly and knowledgeable people| with lots of delightful amenities such as a breakfast bar and happy hour spread. We stayed in a suite which was a reasonable rate with plenty of rooms for three adults. I literally have nothing but compliments for this property and would recommend to anyone who wants a clean| friendly| well-situated| comfortable stay among like visitors.,
1,24 hours in NYC,My first visit to NYC. The rooms were clean & modern. Staff was cordial and helpful. Continental breakfast was upscale. Happy hour consisted of wine & a variety of cheeses. I would stay again and I recommend to anyone coming to NYC.,
4,Impressed overall!,i really liked Hotel Giraffe. It was a true find in a great neighborhood! I loved the wine and cheese in the evening and the complimentary breakfast. The service was great and the rooms were small but truly charming.,
9,A Lovely Respite,"I felt so very spoiled here from the real live plants in my room to the attentiveness of the staff. I grabbed a couple cookies from the ever abundant cookie plate one evening and a staff member asked me how long I was staying. I told him just that night and he said| ""Oh| if you were going to be here I while I'd give you a box."" Yes| that generous. And the location is PERFECT!",
59,Comfort| Great Location and Exceptional Service,Hotel Giraffe is an oasis of calm in bustling Manhattan.  The location is excellent.  The hotel is only a short walk to two different subway lines| there is an abundance of yellow cabs in the area and it is within walking distance of major sights such as the Empire State Building and many excellent shopping areas.  Our fifth floor king balcony room was comfortable| spacious and spotlessly clean.  The large windows and high ceiling made the room feel airy and bright.  The room was well furnished with comfortable chairs| a granite-topped desk and a heating/cooling system that was both effective and quiet.  There was a bit of traffic noise| which is expected in New York| but it did not affect our ability to sleep.  Hotel Giraffe includes a number of amenities that would be extra at…,
103,Great stay| wonderful room!,"I found a deal on ""Hotel Tonight"" for Hotel Giraffe| and booked without hesitation.  After staying at both the Library Hotel and Casablanca| I knew that this hotel group was one of my favorites. And they did not let me down| as everything was top notch. I checked in late in the day| and was given a room on floor #2 (not usually a good thing)| but in this case my room was HUGE| and even had a large balcony| so it more than made up for a lack of a view.  The evening wine/cheese is one of the best things about this place in my opinion (as well as the AM breakfast spread) since it saves money on pricey restaurants if you aren't looking for a huge meal. I consider it a deal as someone who has always stayed at these hotels solo| so it would be a big perk for couples/families. The…",
30,Stunning rooms| excellent staff.,We stayed for our final night of our honeymoon after hearing great things about this hotel and were not disappointed. Our room was large and the bed was a dream. Large bathroom too| very tasteful decor all round. I enjoyed the alarm clock with nature sounds to relax me to sleep! The location is perfect| just five minutes away from the flatiron. We enjoyed the cheese and wine evening| the host was so attentive and sweet and helped my husband who had a cold- by offering him some lemon ginger tea! In fact all the staff we encountered were brilliant even though we were only there a night! Breakfast was good too. We would definitely come back and stay for longer next time!,
86,i wish i were there now.....,our 2nd stay here.....of course that means the 1st stay must have been fabulous and it was!!!  during  our most recent stay we invited friends to join us and so we booked two suites...all i can say is....always go for a suite ....preferably with a balcony....ALL the staff at this hotel are superb!!!  and as helpful as they can be accompanied by a smile....the breakfasts| snacks| wine and bites in the lobby are the best!  ....and to have 24 hr cappuchinos and lattes available free is a dream come true!  the piano in the lobby was perfect for my nephew to write his music at any hour| as he needed to work on daily during the week we were there.  the on site dining was excellent but pricey....and we did order room service in a pinch after dining there and again the food was…,
74,Top drawer hotel,Second visit here for my wife and my first time. This place has got to be one of the best in new york. Quality rooms with lovely furnishings. Staff are so attentive and are always there to cater for all your needs|whether it be local knowledge|directions or booking shows etc. Everyone is so friendly and so helpful. The breakfast is really really nice and provides cereals|pastries|eggs|toast|fruit|yoghurts and all the usual beverages. Each evening the hotel provides cheese and biscuits and free wine. What an overly gesture. Each evening my wife and I returned  we were greeted with a glass of presecco and a fine array of cheeses with biscuits.just what you needed after a day's shopping and sightseeing .recharging the batteries for a night on the town. The hotel is ideally situated…,
14,Excellent Hotel,Stayed for a week at the Hotel Giraffe over Easter and could not fault anything about the hotel and all agreed we would have liked to have stayed longer and would definitely return if coming back to New York. It was our first time in New York - me| wife and 13 year old son - and was a little unsure where to stay| as regards location and style of hotel. So glad that we did not stay near Times Square as it was always so busy. It was nice to be away from the crowds but still easy to see the sights and get around. We were on the third floor overlooking 26th Street. Room was very comfortable with a living room and separate bedroom which was ideal for an extended stay| we weren't tripping over each other all in the same space. It was noisy of a night but I think that is just New York.…,
37,Very nice room| wonderful staff,This is a lovely small hotel in a great location for shopping| eating in NYC. The staff is excellent| very helpful and they have high attention to detail. Our one bedroom king suite was nicely appointed and worked well for a small family. We loved the wine and cheese reception in the evening| as well as the cappuccino/espresso machine available in the lobby at all hours -- very nice touch. The breakfast was pretty basic| but was convenient to have in the lobby vs. going out each morning. It would have be nicer if it included something warm| like cooked oatmeal (they had instant available) or one warm entree item (frittata or quiche| perhaps). But| we definitely will recommend this hotel to others and hope to return again soon!,
118,I Hate to use the word| Charming| but ...,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Hotel Giraffe.  The lobby and staff were low-key without the attitude of other hotels in the vicinity.  Although my room was “smallish|” the tall ceilings and clever use of mirrors eliminated any feeling of being cramped.  It looks like a lot of thought and care went into the renovation:  The rooms are luxuriously appointed with no observed detail being missed (e.g.| Bath robes| slippers| magnifying mirror in bath| nice use of natural wood and granite).  The ability to request down pillows was a definite plus as well.  Oh| and the breakfast was well above-average.  As this is convenient to my NY office| I will be staying here again.,
49,Home away from home,Huge value here at this oasis in midtown! Impeccable door| desk and room service| we have traveled around the world and this encounter is at the paramount of a service experience. Wonderful lobby area with refreshments 24/7.  Satisfying breakfast and afternoon wine and cheese both extremely well done. Server Gabriella is a gem and she will take care of you and your family with gusto. This is an international respite with atleast four foreign languages overheard during our short stay. Family friendly. We walked to the Gerswin Theater| Empire State Building| Broadway| Times Square| Central Park and a ton of great foods and drinks from here. Definitely returning| soon!,
14,"Great ""family"" sized suite!",Our room had a sleeper sofa (which was apparently very comfortable) in a separate living area| separated by a door from the bedroom which had a king-sized bed.  Complimentary breakfast - with bagels| yogurt and fresh fruit - was a nice touch| as well as wine & cheese in the afternoon| and coffee/tea throughout the day.  Our room was on the 3d floor| however| so we could hear the street traffic every morning.,
107,Go ahead| indulge yourself. You deserve it. ,This is an absolutely wonderful hotel that you shouldn't pass up. We loved it so much| we extended our stay!    I have no complaints whatsoever. The rooms are very big| the staff incredibly helpful| the included breakfast yummy and the complimentary wine & cheese service every evening should never be missed!  This is a gem of a hotel. The location is great and you don't feel like you're in the crazy world of NYC - it's very calming.   It's a bit pricey but what the heck| don't you deserve it?!?!  Highly recommended and we will be back.,
27,An absolute gem of a hotel!,We have stayed in many hotels in New York City from high end to budget - and this  was my absolute favorite.  The rooms were lovely| with beautiful bedding and bath supplies; the lobby was welcoming and breakfast| both more than we could want and served with a smile.  The staff went out of their way to help in every way possible - and the location is perfect! A wonderful place to recharge in every way.,
5,Lovely Hotel!,We had a wonderful stay at Hotel Giraffe.  The rooms were clean and updated and the staff was so professional and helpful.  The breakfast was an added bonus and all of my kids loved it.  It was great hotel for my family of 6| and we were able to get connecting rooms.  I highly recommended Hotel Giraffe for your stay in New York City.,
71,Forever friendly. We always feel as if we were in our own home.,Very good hotel. Its location| its smallish size| its value for money| the forever smiling staff. Everyone goes out of their way to please you. Even when the bread ran out| someone dashed outside and bought a few loaves at the local shop. Gabriela at the food/beverage counter is priceless.,
11,50th Birthday celebration,Great hotel| tentative staff| super location| lovely breakfast and informal complimentary cheese and Proseco in the evenings......keep up the good work....................................................,
1,Wonderful Two Night Stay,My wife and I were traveling to NYC to celebrate a special occasion.  We had not stayed at the Hotel Giraffe previously| but thought we would give it a try based on the hotel descriptions from other reviews.    We booked a one-bedroom suite and mentioned the special occasion at the time of booking.  On checking into our room| we were greeted by a nice bottle of red wine with a note from the manager acknowledging the occasion.    In addition| the room that was held for us was on the top floor next to an open air seating area - a very private location and a very comfortable and tastefully decorated room.  In addition to the great room| the hotel staff was particularly friendly| attentive and helpful throughout our stay.  The hotel absolutely lived up to the favorable reviews we…,
7,Perfect for us in every way,We absolutely loved our stay at the Giraffe Hotel and if (if?... when!) we go back to NY| that's where we'll be back. Couldn't fault the room| the location| the staff. We particularly loved the reception of the hotel with natural light: it was perfect to sit and soak the early spring rays of sunshine while enjoying the free afternoon cheese and wine.  The staff were friendly and helpful and it all induced a very nice| welcoming atmosphere.  My sons enjoyed playing the piano and the staff and other guests made an appreciative audience -to the boys delight :) Surprisingly| we had a good rest despite doing lots in NY: the bedding was very good! We were on the sixth floor: I didn't mind the subtly sound of traffic -all part of the NY experience as far as I am concerned- especially…,
14,Cool Name| Cooler Hotel,Hotel Giraffe is a fabulous hotel where they take care of all the things you find annoying at other hotels.  Great morning breakfast and coffee| snacks throughout the day| wine and cheese in the evening where you can relax after a day of running around and free wifi.  (Why don't hotels just include this in the cost of the room...or is this one of those fee things?)  We had two rooms at the Hotel Giraffe.  Both were tastefully appointed and comfortable| with lots of amenities.  We had king rooms with cute little balconies facing on Park Avenue S.  Very nice.  The visit was flawless from dropping off the car to checking out.  Great staff| great housekeeping| relaxing and quiet even though our room faced Park Avenue South.  The front desk folks double as concierges solving several…,
39,Great hotel,This is a great hotel in so many ways.  Location is good| the staff| all of them without exception are wonderful. The rooms are comfortable|  large for a city very clean abd little extras like water abd chocolates are a nice touch.  The free wine and cheese|  on tap coffee abd snacks are a great bonus. I will certainly be back. All round great stay. Thank you everyone! !,
69,Nice boutique hotel,Nice place good location for our needs  Prepaid for rooms and both were directly in front of the elevators? rooms clean and neat.  Turn down service provided only one of the 2 nights I was there?  It was fine but for the money seemed average,
2,Family trip in NY,"Hotel Giraffe was a very pleasant experience. Very good service | nice and comfortable rooms| welcoming atmosphere in the reception with ""after day/walk"" in the evenings and breakfast in the mornings.",
133,Reviews are Accurate,This boutique hotel is truly top notch. And this is an example of when you really can count on trip advisor for accurate reviews. The rooms are well taken care of. You don't feel like you are renting someone else's apartment. The location is good with a high rated steak house just down the block. It is nice to see the full deal come together. The staff are attentive and treat you like a valued guest. No complaints about this place. The ratings are deserved!,
4,Unbelievable!,This is one of the nicest boutique hotels that caters to business travelers where I've ever had the pleasure of staying.  It has newly furnished big rooms| especially for New York| a very friendly and accommodating staff.  (Especially Gabby| the hostess for the hotel's nightly wine & cheese.)  Centrally located at 26th and Park  for easy access to both downtown and midtown.  Access to the New York Sports Club a couple of blocks away.  As some one who travels to NY on business| this is the place for me from now on!,
1,Wonderful hotels are tough to find in NY,I travel to NY often on business and have stayed in many hotels. While there are some that are adequate - few would draw me back. With Hotel Giraffe| I finally have a place that I can rave about and will definitely return.  The decor is bright and calming.  The rooms are a good size for NY.  The service is amazing - friendly| responsive| knowledgeable.  The amenities - fluffy towels| robes| continental breakfast and wine in the evening - all make this a destination hotel.  Plus the location was great and the price was reasonable -- though this was a special deal through the web.,
16,Great Stay,"Im writing a review for a simple reason. Above the great place that it is with a grand piano downstairs| at 6am on the day of my departure the guy at the door...seeing it was raining....said ""heres an umbrella"" I told him i was walking 2 blocks to Bfast then to JFK. He said ""dont worry about it""!. Its those SMALL things that make a hotel great  :-)  Oh...i DID bring it back anyway.",
11,Fantastic hotel,It was our first visit to NYC and as I always read hotel reviews on tripadvisor before booking I did the same this time.  The reviews were excellent| infact I could not find a really negative review and so on this basis I booked this hotel for out 5 night stay. There was nothing about the Hotel Giraffe that we disliked.  The staff were all friendly and helpful and really seemed to enjoy their job| it was spotlessly clean| the food was really good and the location was brilliant.  I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone and was absolutely BRILLIANT.,
15,Don't judge a book by it's front desk,I recently stayed at Hotel Giraffe with friends over a long weekend and we had a wonderful experience. When we first walked in| we were a little taken aback by the TINY front desk| making it seem a little hostel-like. When we got upstairs| we were taken aback by our adorable room. It was modern but with a lot of character and VERY clean. Our favorite part of the stay was the lovely breakfast and most importantly| the happy hour every night from 5-7 with free wine and cheese. The staff was incredibly helpful and kind| and truly felt welcoming every time we entered the building. The ONLY downside I would say is the locating if you are hoping to do a lot of touristy activities. We spent a fortune on cabs!,
10,A great place,A really great| clean modern hotel with a nice junior king suite. Walking distance anywhere for most. Nice to have the bagel| fruit and cereal breakast included. Friendly staff. My second visit  One tip - I was in room 501. Try NOT to stay on 26th street side it's right next to 69th regiment armory building which is a huge venue and you will hear bottles and bags smashing for hours all day long until late into the night|  into 2 massive dumpsters outside. I had earplugs and it was ok. If I return I'll ask for a room on other side of building of possible.,
3,Always wonderful.,My wife and I have had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Giraffe many times over the past few years; and we love it. The wonderful staff treats us like family.       A particularly nice feature is the extensive continental breakfast and the evening wine reception. The Giraffe is a small| comfortable| boutique hotel with very tastefully decorated rooms.  We're anxious to return to the Giraffe on our next extended visit to NYC. For us it's the perfect New York hotel.,
5,A gem of a hotel  for a first visit to New  York,We loved the hotel - its location  was great - mid town Manhatten with easy subway access| and near to many attractions which were an easy walk away. We| included mum and 2 adult children. We were accommodated in a| wonderful king suite room| with 2 separate sleeping areas. We liked the boutique feel to the hotel| its relaxed  ambience| its inclusive breakfasts| the hot drinks that were always available| the charming and supportive staff| and the wine and cheese available as another inclusive late afternoon / early evening accompanied by a pianist The  inclusive wifi  was another attraction. We would definitely highly recommend this hotel and would be happy to return,
183,Fantastic,We've never stayed at a hotel that has absolutely nothing to fault. Super clean room was nicely appointed and larger than expected. Asked for and received an upper level room(11th floor). Wonderful views of Park Ave. and 26th Street. Hotel staff is friendly and eager to accommodate. Gabrielle was so pleasant at breakfast and during the wine and cheese happy hour. Fantastic hotel and staff. Recommended.,
5,Great stay in Manhattan,All the staff at The Giraffe are courteous and professional. The breakfast and evening wine make our stay especially pleasant| the room on the 26th street side was quiet and the Park Ave S. location suits our needs very well. We have stayed here many times and it just seems to get better every time. Highly recommend thIs hotel!,
13,Playbill,We booked The Giraffe as a base for our one night in NYC. The hotel was recommended by another couple and we were not disappointed. Jose| the doorman/bellman greeted us enthusiastically. We arrived too early to checkin so Jose took very good care of our belongings. The front desk crew (I wish I had remembered their names) helped us to understand where we might find some lunch and helped understand the timing and travel involved to get to our matinee. Upon returning we were checked in rapidly and our luggage arrived at our rooms. Great room with French doors to a small balcony. Too cold to utilize it though. Very clean. The wine and cheese reception was great and  Gabrielle took great care of us!  The breakfast was ample continental style. Again| Gabrielle did a great job. There…,
3,Last minute NYC trip - no complaints,This is a European style hotel - no huge lobby - no extra services - but the Front Desk crew is great.  I booked a room here after seeing the place last time we stayed at Gramercy Park Hotel.  This is very close and suited my needs - as I like staying in the Gramercy area.  Great restaurants are near - subway access is great.  Overall experience was excellent - will stay there again - nice sized rooms - all w balcony/french doors - nice size closet/bath and great built-ins in the room.  Overall very nice design and feel to the place.,
13,Perfect location,The Hotel Giraffe is a charming boutique hotel centrally located in Manhattan. I was concerned about traffic noise from Park Avenue and the staff ensured that we had a suite in a quiet location. The bed was very comfortable and the suite was well-appointed. There was ample wardrobe space - with two wardrobes - and| as a pleasant surprise| there were plenty of coat hangers. We only live an hour away form town but my husband has been working brutal hours and we had tickets for shows on Friday and Saturday so I felt that two nights of relaxation were required. Love the hotel and would recommend it to family and friends.,
49,Excellent hotel and superb location,I had a fabulous holiday at this hotel last year. The rooms were surprisingly roomy and impeccably clean. The staff were all helpful and friendly. The location was fabulous| within easy walking distance of time square and with plenty of delightful restaurants within staggering distance.   However it was the hotels extra touches that made the experience so memorable for me| the fabulous bagels and fruit for breakfast and the champagne reception every evening. Delightful| would highly recommend. ,
7,nice clean room good location,Great location| very good staff| bathroom and room spotless. parking was easy really good restaurants in the area |nice breakfast and cocktails.I would certainly come again if the price is right. If you like to walk you are close to many things or the subway is nearby.,
98,Fantastic Experience,I am afraid to put in a review| because I want to keep this little gem a secret! From the check-in service (helpful| friendly) to housekeeping (they came and set up a crib in the room for my daughter and son-in-law) to the complimentary wine and cheese (served by the fabulous Gabriela) to the breakfast (something for everyone) this hotel won't disappoint! They even helped us to celebrate my husband's birthday! It is in a good location| near everything|but still quiet.,
14,Lovely Surprise,I finally had a chance to stay at Hotel Giraffe after cabbing by it for years and I wish I had stayed there sooner.  The hotel is a little more traditional than my adventures lead me| but the space was well designed. My room had a balcony and was insanely quiet- which I enjoyed immensely.  The staff was incredibly friendly an accommodating- my only complaint is I didn't have more time to spend at the hotel- meeting you know.  I can't wait to try the hotel again- I highly recommend!,
576,Nice small hotel | away from Times Square,We stayed at Times Square and then split our trip up with a visit to Hotel Giraffe. We have stayed here before so we knew what we were getting. Small hotel with excellent staff. The wine and cheese is excellent and the ladies really take care of you. The pillows and the beds are excellent. Nice area just to walk around in . We will go back on our next visit.,
180,Great small hotel in excellent location.,We spent 5 nights at the Giraffe Hotel for a long weekend getaway in the city and it was perfect. We loved the location| which is really convenient to the theatre| museums and good restaurants. The hotel is very comfortable| with excellent mattresses and pillows.  The plug in our tub didn't stop the water flowing out and I called downstairs to see if they could fix it. The staff persisted trying new plugs and then the manager| who had left for the day| arrived with a new plug he had gone to purchase! What service!  The staff are very hospitable and breakfast in the lounge downstairs was excellent. Evening wine and snacks was very welcome after a busy day sightseeing. What a lovely| comfortable| quiet hotel! It was a peaceful retreat.,
3,The staff| accommodations| location| cookies| champagne - perfectly perfect!,The staff was beyond helpful| friendly and polite.  The room was beautiful - complete with robes| slippers| even a scale (something I always miss when I'm away from home and depend on!) and a VERY comfortable bed.  The location was great.  Far away from the hustle and bustle but close enough within walking distance.  Breakfast was delicious.  The whole experience| truthfully| was delicious!,
2,Lovely hotel,Such a comfortable hotel--clean| pretty| wonderful staff and excellent breakfast in the lounge downstairs. They also do a very nice jazz and drink hour in the evening| though I've not gotten to partake of it. Even so| just walking in in the evening with the piano playing| it's a wonderful atmosphere.  They also just have nice thoughtful touches-ihome sound machines in the room| good robes| etc. Highly recommend this hotel. Have not stayed there with my family| but I definitely would. Great location near Madison Sq. Park| the Flat Iron| Eataly| etc.,
2,A real gem!,I LOVED everything about my stay at Hotel Giraffe. Every staff member went out of their way to make my friends and I feel welcomed and well take care of. The breakfast and happy hour were such a treat. Our room was much larger than expected. We spent days searching for the perfect hotel and Hotel Giraffe exceeded our expectations.  Book this hotel now| you will not be disappointed.,
2,Small but lovely!  Great location and hospitality.,We shared a beautiful corner suite with our teenage daughter for five nights while looking at colleges.  We had plenty of room and were not stepping on each other's things.  Good storage for longer stays.  Loved the large balcony doors and windows.  The continental breakfast was very nice and the evening snacks were perfect.  We would have liked the option of having one small restaurant there with room service and a bar.  The wine served in the evening was terrible but the hostess is charming.  They should find better wines for the money if that is all that is available.  Extremely friendly and helpful staff.  Our bed was a little too hard but they provided a memory foam topper for it.,
5,New York at its Best!,Hotel Giraffe is New York at its best. High energy| boutique| classy and informal| and a breeze to navigate. Well located to all parts of Manhattan| even Brooklyn| if you are willing to walk 5-10 minutes to one of three subway locations. The staff is consistently great. We were there 6 days. Will definitely return. Great for couples.  Great for reunions with friends.,
84,Small boutique hotel on a great loacation,Located just in the middle between downtown and uptown. Metro nearby but both financial district and central park are within walking distance. Very friendly personnel. Spacious rooms. Good quality for a correct price.,
45,Sweet! Really welcoming comfortable and spacious,Usually hotel rooms in NYC are closets with beds. Not this hotel Plenty of room to settle in| complimentary wine in the evening and breakfast in the morning. Space to relax and friendly service.  Valet parking is available and the location is great.,
7,As always terrific!,Visited New York this past weekend and stayed at the Giraffe as always. The staff is excellent and very attentive. We used there valet service to park our car. When we went to check out on Sunday morning they had already anticipated our needs and secured the car from the valet and had   the hotel for us.,
276,Great stay in a good location,Stayed here due to TA ratings| budget and location and our expectations were met.  All staff are very friendly and go out of their way to help you.   Comfortable lobby where cheese and wine is served in the evening and breakfast in the morning - good choice and presentation of both. Live pianist on 2 of our 4 nights stay. Service at evening reception and breakfast is friendly and efficient.   We had a standard king bed room which was a good size for NYC and had nice features although a very confusing tv remote (perhaps we are getting old| although did hear other guests were having some difficulty). The shower was good| bed comfortable and there's loads of storage space.   Bread & Tulips restaurant connected to the hotel was good and has a nice bar. We would highly recommend…,
3,Trip to NYC,Great location| great rooms| staff really helpfull. Breakfast in the morning was a real bonus and a great  way to start the day Would recommend this hotel and am looking forward  to booking again for our next holiday to NYC.,
92,Great hotel.,Great hotel in a nice location walking distance to Math Museum| Madison Square Garden| Empire State Building| etc.  Room was large| comfortable| and quiet (a bit of street noise).  Lounge is great with continuous snacks| drinks| and good continental breakfast.,
24,Nicely done!,We only were in town for a night| but thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  We had a king suite| and had ample room to sit and chat when our daughter dropped by after dinner.  The staff was gracious and helpful.  The wine service and breakfast bar were nice additions.  The bed was comfortable and the rooms were spotless.  Perfect location for getting around the city either by cab| subway or on foot.,
147,A birthday trip that will be treasured !!!🎂🍸🍷🍹,From the time i made inquiry prior booking thru emails til check out| superb service!!! Booked thru TA reviews and again| it met my expectations!  Room was really cool n rested so well. Location? Can't beat it! Walking distance to everything n just two blocks away you can used the 6 train! The staff are so accommodating and all our requests materialized. Had a coffee maker in our own room despite having it at the lobby 24hours! Will highly recommend this hotel. Did i mention| i got a card and a bottle of wine for my bday!!!!! Thanks Hotel Giraffe and more power! Will surely be back!!!!,
1,Great stay!,We loved staying at the Hotel Giraffe -- good sized rooms| great amenities| very comfortable main lobby. Would definitely stay again! It's also a great location for getting to anywhere in the city| very close to Union Square| just a block from the 6 train subway.,
31,Average| but fun!,"Expensive| yes| but right in the heart of the city| with good service| great buffet and breakfast| plus wine lounge.  Rooms were clean but the fold out couch in our suite was not as comfortable as it should have been for the other couple who stayed with us| given what was paid for the suite. Room was very clean.  Liked the blackout curtains| & it was surprisingly quiet for the location.  No views on our floor| unless you count the office building right across the street - very ""Rear Window"" if you like that sort of thing!  TV didn't work at first| but we called down to the desk and they were able to fix quickly. Valet service is a bit slow| but the concierge gave very good recommendations for nearby things| so that was a definite plus.  The rooftop lounge was half rented out for…",
1,Great Value,We truly enjoyed our stay at Hotel Giraffe.  The hotel is very clean.  The rooms are spacious by NY standards.  The service is great.  Breakfast is a wonderful bonus with coffee and tea all day.  The location is a quick cab ride to Times Square.  You can walk to excellent restaurants| Union Square| a subway stop and more.  We have stayed here twice and we will definitely come back.,
1,A truly terrific and superior experience to hotel-stay in NYC.,My wife and I had stayed at several other hotels in the mid-town and Village areas| and this hotel surpassed our expectations on the amenities| the room size| the lobby area| and the liveliness in the lobby during the entire day.  A very vibrant hotel paying close attention to the guests and their needs.  We will stay here again as it is now our go-to hotel for our 3-4 day trips to New York.,
33,Wonderful Stay,My husband and I has an absolutely wonderful stay here.  We two people who greeted us at the Front Desk couldn't have been nicer and it set the tone for the entire stay.  The room was amazing - spacious and clean.  The location is perfect for anything one might want to do in NYC.  We wished we could have stayed longer and cannot wait to go back.,
4,Boutique is best!,The Hotel Giraffe is exactly the type of small hotel that I prefer to stay in.  From the hotel| it is easy to get to downtown| midtown and uptown.  The hotel itself is very quiet with well decorated rooms and lovely touches such as books and plants to make the room feel more like home.  An excellent Continental breakfast is provided| along with evening wine tastings.  To top it all off| all the staff are friendly| helpful and happy to share their knowledge of New York City.  The Giraffe was an excellent experience and I shall certainly be staying there again.,
11,Great hotel!!,Myself and my girlfriend spent two nights at the end of Feb. The staff were excellent and very helpful. the complimentary wine| cheese and biscuits was a lovely touch as was the breakfast .the rooms were to a very good standard and spotlessly clean. The hotel is in a fab location.altogether a very very good experience and would recommend it highly. Kind regards Mr Bowden,
36,Superb accomodations and hospitality!,We arrived to find that we had been upgraded to a suite after having booked 1 month in advance.  The room was very nice and comfortable.  The hotel is perfectly situated and accessible. The entire staff was courteous and helpful any and every time we needed their guidance.,
16,Wonderful NYC Hotel!,I love the Giraffe.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  I really enjoy the complimentary breakfast and the wine and cheese in the evening.  The rooms are very clean and nicely decorated.  Overall| one of my favorite hotels in NYC!,
1,We'll be back,All of the staff did everything they could to make our stay as special as possible. Nothing was too much trouble from keeping the Prosecco flowing to sweeping the snow off the car. The atmosphere is very relaxed and friendly making us all feell welcome.,
59,Very pleased,Our night at the Hotel Giraffe was a splurge for us but we were not disappointed. The staff was very helpful and friendly| the room was clean| pleasant and of a nice size. The location was good. The morning breakfast was excellent| the afternoon coffee a treat. We will be back.,
1,Great location and still quiet!,My husband and I were lucky to get a last minute room at the Giraffe for a weekend getaway. We stayed in a classic suite and by pre-paying for our room| the rate was dramatically lower. The rooms are spacious and clean. The hotel staff was so friendly and accommodating. The location was fantastic and there was no street noise! Complimentary breakfast and happy hour were great! Can't wait to stay again!,
5,Big pleasure in a small hotel,Having stayed at an assortment of excellent hotels in other countries and my home town of New York I was pleasantly surprised to get such great satisfaction from thus relatively small hotel.  Located in lower mid-town there is walking distant access to a jazz club| excellent restaurants| parks and eclectic shopping.  Offering a neat and clean look as well as a well-trained dtaff| the smaller space is an easy trade for convenience and price.  Go and enjoy.  ,
44,Great service & amenities,Repeat customer| who will continue to stay here. Great location in the city| nice rooms| and lovely amenities. I love the complimentary breakfast and happy hour| as well as the room service| which was really quick each time I ordered. Front desk is attentive and quick to respond to business needs (documents printed and brought to room).,
83,Great hotel. Fantastic staff.,Very comfortable| relaxing hotel. Loved the ambiance.  Nice breakfast. Room was great. I cannot say enough about the staff| outgoing| friendly| always available and helpful.  I have already booked my next trip.,
6,Warm and Cozy in the city,My wife and I traveled to NYC to visit our daughter who had taken a job on Park Ave. and to celebrate Valentines day.  Of course a trip to NYC in February can be tough. But the Hotel Giraffe staff made everything better. The large balcony suite offered us a wonderful view of Park Ave. Very well appointed and turndown service was excellent and well timed. Even after our trip was extended for two days due to weather problems at LGA we were able to secure a king bed room. It was very large and worked great. The staff even moved our bags and belongings so we would not miss a minute of the action in the city.  I can not stress more the kindness of the morning crew at breakfast and at the wine time in the afternoon excellent. That all day coffee and snacks is fantastic in not only…,
5,Central| well-appointed hotel,I had a short overnight stay in NYC and wanted to stay at The Library Hotel but there no openings so I booked at their sister location Hotel Giraffe. Although my stay was fleetingly short (basically sleeping)| I have nothing but a very positive impression of this establishment. I had only booked a small queen room but must have been upgraded to a studio with adjoining front room. The decor was modern| unfussy and stylish and the bed was very comfortable. Definitely making a point of staying at the Giraffe on my next trip| cannot beat it's central location.,
3,The best and only place to stay in NYC,"Hotel Giraffe treats you as if you are the only guest.  Full customer service| you feel like you are staying at a ""high end"" hotel.  The continental breakfast| the happy hour| the 24 hour service of snacks| coffee| water| etc.| surpasses every other. I will stay there again and again.",
6,Fabulous Hotel| Customer Service and amenities.,My two best GFs  brought me here for a birthday weekend in NYC this past November. WOW! This place is so great. What a wonderful treat it was. The staff are always thoughtful attentive and professional. We arrived early and they were setting up our room| we only had to wait 10 minutes. Coffee/espresso/lattes and cookies in the lobby all day| so waiting was no problem.  We had a king studio with sofa bed. Very nice size rooms for NYC.  The wine and snack reception in the evening was great. Again| very attentive and generous service.  Free breakfast int eh lobby was super nice- yogurt| granola| bagels| pastries| fresh fruit salad.   Believe every review in which they go on about how great it is ...because it is!,
54,would return,nice hotel in a good location. stayed in a suite on the tenth floor. higher room is suggested as street noise in nyc can be loud especially at night. nice bed and a really nice bathroom. good amenities. bed was comfy but bedding was somewhat on the short side. being tall this was not too good. for some strange reason the room attendant kept shutting off our room heat and when we returned to our room the temperature was less than 65 degrees. also when our heating system came on it started with a loud noise which at night was upsetting. our room was 1006. the hotel has a really good italian restaurant in it called Bread and Tulips.our room had a very comfy fold out sofa which according to our daughter was good to sleep on.our stay was 2/5 to 2/10/2015.price was good for nyc.,
465,Home away from home,We just spent 10 days in this hotel and we were glad we choose to stay here. We had a suite with a separate bedroom and found it quite spacious for NY standards. The furniture is a little old but well kept and clean.What we liked the most is the excellent service and the good atmosphere at the lobby. Especially during these cold days we spent a lot of time at the lobby which is the heart of this hotel. In the mornings| breakfast is served there. Breakfast is self service but the staff is there to bring you everything. There was fresh fruit salad| selection of breads and croissants| hard boiled eggs| cereals|... After 10 am| the lobby becomes like a living room where you can still eat fruits| cookies| pastries and have coffee or tea. And at 5 pm ik becomes like a bar where you…,
1,Expected more bang for my buck :(,I recently stayed at the hotel for Valentine's day weekend. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The room was clean and spacious. The bed however was hard as a rock and we didn't receive our breakfast even though we hung the tag before the deadline. Expected a little more pizzazz so to speak for the price we paid but overall a decent experience.  I would recommend this hotel to the travelling business man or woman| was not very romantic. ,
3,Perfect in every way,We stayed for four nights in February and had a perfect stay.   The temperature outside dropped to minus 10 on most days so a warm welcoming hotel was hugely appreciated. I was visiting with my teenage daughter and her friend and we stayed in a quad room on the 10th floor. I last stayed at the Giraffe in 2005 and little has changed - the hotel was perfect in 2005 and it is still perfect in 2015.  The service| the rooms| the bathrooms| the beds| the breakfast and the staff are all fantastic.  The staff are a credit to the hotel - always really pleasant and happy to help with advice| bookings and recommendations. I have recommended Hotel Giraffe to friends for 10 year and will continue to do so.,
13,Simply great!,I had the honor to stay with Hotel Giraffe during the blizzard which did not arrive in NY. But I could not feel better and cozy as staying with Hotel Giraffe for this special time. The bathroom had a bathtub| wonderful during the cold winter. The staff is very friendly| caring and competent! Everything is clean and well maintained and organized. It is nice to have a complimentary breakfast where fresh fruits are offered and soy milk as well even the snacks and wine in the evening! Just around the corner there a plenty options for indian food. I am looking forward to stay with Hotel Giraffe for my next time in NY. I am in love with Hotel Giraffe and its peeps!  Ich hatte die Ehre im Hotel Giraffe zu logieren| als der Blizzard angekündigt war| der nicht eintraf. Es war für mich…,
3,Lovely place in NYC,I was impressed with the hospitality and kindness of JR who took my reservation over the phone| but once my husband and I got there we realized the entire staff was simply wonderful!  It's a comfortable| beautiful| spotless place to stay in a terrific location in the City.  We were so happy there.,
27,Just Perfect,Read all the reviews and I must admit I was sure the hotel couldn't live up to the hype. It did. We stayed for 5 nights in cold| cold February. Everything we wanted from a hotel we got and more. Lovely rooms. The most comfortable beds. Great bathroom. Healthy and wholesome breakfast. Coffee and snacks available in the lobby throughout the day and night. Free fast WiFi. Evening cheese and wine receptions. Everything about our stay was so good and just right. The hotel added to our NYC experience. I must mention the staff. They are an absolute credit to the hotel and made us feel so welcome. If and when we come back to NYC| then I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else.,
3,Excellence in Manhattan,From soft sheets| fluffy towels| to excellence customer service...this Hotel is awesome!  There is not one thing to say that isn't positive.  The staff was very friendly and helpful and we loved the breakfast and happy hour. The location is perfect too!  Walk out to Park Ave and turn left or right...you can't go wrong in either direction.  And there is a subway stop just a few blocks in either direction.  Our trip was wonderful and the Hotel had a lot to do with it.  We will be staying there again!,
1,Great place to stay,Hotel Giraffe is in a great location on Park Avenue. The rooms are fairly standard| though large for NYC. The highlight of the room is that most of them have French doors that open to a small balcony. There is a awesome wine reception betweeb 6 and 8pm with crackers| cheese| and olives.Breakfast is included  | with fresh juices| pastries| and cereals. The italian restaurant in the basement had a great atmosphere and the food was pretty good. Definitely recommend staying here.,
55,The Staff Shines Here,Nice hotel & well situated.  Room is fairly spacious for NYC-nice linens but rather hard beds.  Bathroom is small and the hotel should invest in better hair dryers.  Overall| we enjoyed our stay here.  The slight negatives were made up for by the graciousness and friendliness of the staff!,
8,Great hotel,I stayed here for 4 nights with my sister in law and two nieces . It was fantastic | staff were excellent rooms lovely big clean .. Continental breakfast was lovely | and the wine and cheese nights were most welcome We did the sex and the city tour and it turns out our hotel was featured in the programme .. It is an excellent hotel very well located reasonably priced .. I would have no hesitation in recommending it ....,
1,596,Lucky!,Scored an incredible rate and discovered how to park free downtown NYC steps from the hotel in March 2013!  I am sure the room offered more square footage than I will have in NYC anytime soon.  Incredible beds| bath| location| service| with a variety of free beverages offered in the lobby - what a savings.  Lucky| like I said| but can be done.  This hotel is one of the best I have accommodated.
2,The way a boutique NYC hotel should be!,Great staff- warm| helpful| and friendly!  The rooms were good sized and comfy. The complimentary 5pm Wine and Cheese with live piano music in the hotel lobby/lounge is a great way to kick off your evening prior to stepping out.  There's a nice free spread of continental breakfast every morning too.  Oh| and did I mention there's also free Wifi?  The Giraffe is upscale boutique hotel elegance without the usual crazy NYC hotel prices.  I also love the Park Avenue South location just north of Union Square and Grammercy Park.  I cannot wait to come back.,
11,Comfy| Cozy and Clean Boutique Hotel!,I would stay here again in a second! Super friendly and helpful staff. Large clean and modern rooms with big tvs| comfy beds and nice size bathrooms with tubs. Lots of space to store your things! Snacks with Tea / Coffee always available in the lobby! :) And the Italian restaurant has delicious food. After a freezing cold day out it was lovely to return to the cozy warm hotel for a cup of tea and a cookie in the lobby before heading to our individual rooms. Felt like coming home. :),
75,Don't let the secret get out!,The Giraffe is a fabulous hotel with a boutique vibe in Murray Hill. We love it! Great service| great rooms| great breakfast| great happy hour. What more could you ask for? We can't think of anything else we would want or expect.,
76,A Warm and Homey Boutique,We have stayed here on several occasions and think of it as our 'go to' hotel in Manhattan.  The service is great| the rooms are large and clean and the breakfast is free.  And the wine and cheese in the evening is just icing on the cake.  Location is good.  It is a hike to walk to the theatre district but can be done| especially in nice weather.  There are great restaurants in the area.   We would recommend this hotel.  A great value.,
15,Great Stay at the Hotel Giraffe,Just got back from 2 nights at the Hotel Giraffe.  It was lovely.  I was traveling w/ a girlfriend and we had plenty of room for the 2 of us.  Large bathroom| comfy beds w/ a big TV| small balcony.  The continental breakfast was perfect and the nightly wine and cheese reception (with a live piano music) was a nice way to start our nights. It felt like a small boutique hotel with excellent personalized service. Loved the location too - lots of options for dinners| lunchs| etc. We ended up at Dos Caminos next door for dinner one night - and it was fun and delicious w/ a lively crowd.  The next night| we ended up at Bread and Tulips - an Italian restaruant in the hotel's lower level.  We were a little skeptical of it but it was great too!  And| as hotel guests| we got a discount…,
18,Fantastic NYC hotel,I love this hotel and will definitely choose to stay here again when in NYC. Everything is clean and tidy and every staff person we encountered was friendly and helpful and smiling. The room we were in (2 doubles and a balcony) felt spacious because of the balcony window- which had a nice view. As soon as we pulled up| there was a friendly staff person at our car to assist us in checking in and parking our car in the overnight parking- $45 a day flat rate| which was well worth it to save us on train fare.  What I love most is the lobby- it isn't just a quiet| stale area to pass through to get to your room- it is an inviting destination. The lobby has many comfortable chairs| tables| sofas| easy chairs| and a piano| providing nice entertainment during the daily wine and cheese…,
34,Great location| great facilities,I stayed here in early December 2014.  The location is wonderful| the room was larger than average in New York and very well appointed.  The staff was friendly.  Highly recommend. Closet o shopping and great restaurants.,
178,Hotel Giraffe Stands Tall Above The Rest,I had only planned to be in NYC and stay at the Hotel Giraffe for 3 days but when my trip was extended due to weather| the Hotel Giraffe was very accomodating. The rooms are huge by New York standards. The beds are cozy comfy and the hotel staff is amazing. Very helpful but not overbearing. The breakfast items in the morning are perfect - even down to the gluten-free toast and bagels. And| the cappuccino espresso machine is a delight - along with the coffee. All in all| the Hotel Giraffe will be a memorable part of your trip to the Big Apple.,
44,Great service| clean rooms and friendly staff!,"My first time staying at Hotel Giraffe. I usually stay closer to Union Square but I'd read such great things about this hotel that I decided to give it a try. Plus it's very close to Union Sq.  The front desk staff was fantastic and always sming. Nice touch having the coffee and light breakfast in the morning as well as the wine and cheese in the late afternoon. The rooms were clean and housekeeping was good. The only thing to really improve on would be a renovation of the guest rooms (at least the one I had) and the bathrooms. They were just a little ""old"" and worn. I expected the decor to be more modern and luxurious from what I'd read online. Also| the bathroom amenities were pretty sub par. Something you might find at a motel. Just saying...   Overall | it's good value…",
144,Very nice and fairly priced property,The Hotel Giraffe is a lovely property.  It is clean| the staff is overwhelmingly friendly| and it offers great value for the price.  The rooms are of a typical size for NYC| but many have cute French balconies.  The daily complementary continental breakfast and wine and cheese offerings are a very nice touch| as is the access to a nearby health club.  If you are looking for luxury that will wow you| this is not the place for you| but if you are looking to be well-cared for in clean and pleasant surroundings| you won't do much better in NYC.,
17,Family weekend,My husband and I had to be in NYC for a family affair.  This was our second stay at the Hotel Giraffe.  As with the first| the service was wonderful: from breakfast to wine in the evening. The room was spacious for city hotel. The lobby is a comfortable place to hang out if you don't want to brave the elements.  Would highly recommend this place if you like small hotels with European flair.,
1,Fantastic stay,good communication from the hotel before we arrived. Had our room upgraded to a suite which was impeccable. Room was very spacious| clean and comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful with all our needs. Would highly recommend staying in this hotel and would return for another visit myself.,
1,It's always a wonderful stay at The Giraffe,Kind| courteous| and friendly staff as always.  Located at 5th and 26th| the location is convenient to go up or downtown.  We love the Flatiron district location as well.  It is a short walk to Times Square| the Theater District| Little Eataly| and Madison Park.  We will be back!!,
51,Best hotel I've stayed in EVER| ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD!!!,My daughter and I went to New York City to celebrate her upcoming 18th birthday.  This was her first visit to NYC| and I wanted every bit of it to be wonderful.  Hotel Giraffe began their excellent customer service even before we arrived.  I had put in the notes of the reservation that I would like a room with two doubles and a balcony if one should become available.  One did| and the reservations manager notified me immediately| and made the appropriate change (and he did so with a break in the pricing).  He also exchanged e-mails with me for a day or two while I asked him numerous questions about NYC.  We got to the hotel around 130p| and our room wasn't quite ready (check-in was for 3p).  They checked us in| and invited us to sit in the cozy lobby and have some snacks and/or…,
25,An excellent Hotel that gives you that bit extra,We have just returned to the UK from our stay in the Hotel Giraffe| NEW YORK| USA| where we stayed for 2 nights due to us getting married in New York.  The staff were fantastic so welcoming| warm| pleasant and complementary with every bit of our stay.  We arrived back at the hotel from getting married and in our room was a complementary bottle of Prosecco and glasses congratulating us on getting married.  We also had a meal in their Italian restaurant where again we were given free champagne with our meal. The cheese and wine every evening from 4pm to 7pm added that little bit extra| the tea| coffee| cakes| nibbles etc at anytime through out the day and night all free just added that sparkle to a great located hotel.  About the rooms| well what can I say| just fantastic and the…,
23,Gem of a hotel,Our family of 5 has just returned from our first trip to NYC and spent 4 nights at Hotel Giraffe.   We had a connecting room and suite on the 6th floor.  Happily the hotel could guarantee the room arrangements in advance and even emailed us a floor plan when we were booking.  The beds were very comfortable and despite our suite being on the busier Park Ave| the room was surprisingly quiet and we slept well. The location is excellent (we loved being near Eataly for excellent espresso coffee every morning) and we could walk to lots of places| south to Union square and north to Grand Central Station and beyond.  Being so centrally located it was also a very inexpensive cab ride to most attractions too.  The location is great for sightseeing & eating out although probably less so if…,
16,Outstanding! Best hotel experience I have had since visiting Switzerland.,The staff were extremely helpful during our booking for a suite to accommodate my wife and I and 3 teenagers.   When we arrived the hotel was spotless and stylish and staffed with a group of folks who are all pleasant/happy/intelligent and go out of their way to do whatever they can to make anything enjoyable. They smile| they open doors| they make chit chat| they offer umbrellas when it rains| they move luggage and call cabs.   The woman who staffed the evening reception asked us what our preference in wines was once on the first day - thereafter she had our glasses ready w/out us asking. Nighttime turndown service includes chocolates and music/shades drawn.   The hotel itself is spotlessly clean and well located. The rooms were comfortably furnished| the linens were crisp. The…,
71,Hats off to a great hotel,My spouse and I stayed for 5 nights over Thanksgiving.  I thoroughly researched the hotel before booking and our expectations were very high before arriving.  We booked a suite and upon arrival found the room was not to our liking. The living room area faced a brick wall| the room had very little natural light| very unlike the photos on the hotel website.  What happened next is where you can tell the difference between a great hotel and a good hotel.  After a bit of researching they were able to put us in a room that looked just like the one on the web site.  We were thrilled. The room was everything we expected and more.  The condition of the room was impeccable.  No scratches| stains| nothing was out of order.   There is tons of room for storage.  The lighted bar with hidden…,
38,Great value!,"Four of us stayed for five nights at Hotel Giraffe in January and couldn't speak highly enough of our experience!  We had two suites on high floors.  They were very well appointed| with really comfortable beds and were surprisingly quiet for Manhattan.  The location was close to everything| with a subway station directly across the road under a beautiful old New York building.  Loads of restaurants all round - we loved the newly-opened ""Upland"" across 26th St especially.  Easy walk to Union Square| 5th Avenue shops and plenty more.  Staff were friendly| lots of incorporated features like free drinks in the lounge each evening and free wifi.  Would stay again for sure.",
45,Entirely pleasant experience for six nights,Lovely room| nicely furnished with a large comfortable bed| a handsome useful reading chair| a well lit work space for laptop and chargers and papers| an uncrowded bathroom| a big closet and built-in clothes storage drawers. I was high up on the Park Avenue side| with good light| and just enough street noise to remind me I was in New York.   Every interaction with the staff| housekeeper to desk to the woman who made some very good coffee for me in the lounge after dinner. There's a good-quality simple buffet for breakfast and a nice array of cheese and crackers and drinkable wine in the early evening.   There's a roof garden as well| but since the temperature only got above freezing when the rains came| I only stepped out on it once| and not for long.   Very much recommended.,
71,Great hotel friendly staff and good location,Booked for a 6 night stay over new year having read the reviews. So glad we did. 5th trip to New York and this is the best hotel stayed in. Complimentary wifi| breakfast and cheese and wine! Breakfast was of very good quality and staff friendly and helpful! Room was spacious with lots of storage space. We had a small balcony overlooking park avenue. Some noise but you are in New York! Would def stay again,
30,Better than expected,"When you book a spot during ""hotel week"" can't really anticipate the reality. Hotel Giraffe was an overwhelming delight.. Room was ample size with large terrace window overlooking Park Ave. A tiny terrace was attached but not large enough for anything but a view. But there was a view.| of more than bricks. Bed was comfortable and offered complimentary sleep options: different pillows and different mattress cover. Bathroom was good size with ample lighting. Fixtures and tile work/grouting appeared new. Room was equipped with standard options but also included a small fridge and relatively large full closet. A welcomed surprise was a nightly wine and cheese offering in the lobby. Eminently drinkable plonk. Of particular note was the breakfast buffet. While the coffee was a classic…",
1,Perfect!!!!,We stayed at hotel Giraffe for our first wedding anniversary and from the moment we arrived we knew we had made the right decision. We were welcomed by very friendly staff that couldn't do enough for us. We checked in and got to the room and it's was perfect a short while later we had a knock at the door with an anniversary card from the hotel and a complimentary bottle of wine. Which just put a huge smile on our faces. We headed into town and arrived back just in time to sample the complementary wine and cheese boards. The Persecco kept coming as soon as our glass was empty it was topped back up and the cheese boards and snacks were just enough to tie us over until our evening meal out. The breakfast at the hotel was also a great addition serving classic New York bagels and…,
112,Home away from home,We stayed 10 days and could not have been more comfortable and well looked after.  Because this is a small hotel there is no noise in the passages and lift area| the rooms overlook 26th street so are very quiet for NYC.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  Breakfast is good| pastries and hot beverages available all day and cheese and wine from 5-8 pm (all included in your room rate).  The hotel is well located away from the busy parts of NYC but 2 blocks from the subway so easy to go up or downtown.  Highly recommended.    The restaurants nearby which we enjoyed were the Bread and tulip for pasta| Turkish kitchen| Eataly| Dos Caminos for mexican.,
1,Fantastic location,It was easy to get a cab right in front of the hotel.  Lots of great restaurants with walking distance.  The staff was excellent.  There are just a few rooms on each floor so the hotel was very quiet.  We will definitely stay there again.,
41,lovely boutique hotel,The hotel has a nice lobby area and provides a lovely wine/cheese every evening. Our room was small (although not by NY standards) and tidy. There's no concierge and the folks at the front desk mostly referred us to websites when we asked questions about restaurants| locations| logistics of attractions. The staff are friendly and helpful.  The location is good: quiet but close to major thoroughfares and subway lines.,
34,This was business travel?!,I stayed here on business; I was very impressed with the customer service in all aspects of the hotel.  More importantly the room was spacious and the bed was sooooo comfortable!  The hotel provides a complimentary breakfast| which was perfect.  I enjoyed their complimentary wine and cheese reception; I brought my lap top down to the lobby to work in lieu of working in my room; great decision| the wine and cheese were delicious| the piano player was relaxing and the big fluffy chairs were cozy.  I highly recommend this hotel.,
68,Comfortable hotel in Manhattan,A relaxing hotel with a morning continental breakfast and a wine & cheese happy hour.  Located a block away from Madison Square in the Flatiron district| the hotel is centrally located to Times Square to the north and Greenwich Village to the south.  Both within walking distance.  It's also a two block walk to the subway.  The staff was very accommodating giving directions and making my stay comfortable.  I would stay here again on a return trip.,
452,Look no further in NYC,We have stayed here a number of times while visiting family in NYC and would not think of another place to stay.  If you are visiting NYC from out of town| let me advise you that this hotel offers unusually large rooms| is well located| has great service and offers pluses like a good breakfast| espresso machine and snacks at all times and a very pleasant wine and cheese reception.  The location is on Park Avenue just blocks from the Empire State Building and easy access to both train stations.  What we like is that returning to the hotel| you are in a neighborhood that is residential and not touristy.  The location also allows for easy walks further downtown for a more real NYC experience.  This hotel really has it all...as I said| look no further.,
26,Best hotel I've ever stayed at,The hotel is perfect!    We stayed for three weeks and the staff treated us so well.  The couldn't do anything more to be helpful.  We were on our honeymoon and on arrival the staff had laid out a card and a bottle of prosecco for us.  The continental breakfast| cheese and wine reception were a wonderful addition; as too was the option to have tea and coffee (and biscuits) at any time.    We came back very late one night and the staff recommended a local deli who delivered the most incredible meal.  Housekeeping were friendly and attentive.  The turn down service with a small chocolate and a bottle of water was a very welcome addition.    Wifi is reliable and a lovely little feature is the laptop and printer in the foyer so you can print out tickets and boarding passes.  An ipod…,
14,Cannot Imagine a Better Place to Stay in NYC,We loved the location| the comfort and the staff.  I think of city hotels as being cramped| the staff abrupt and the value poor.  Quite the opposite.  Our room and bath were a nice size (OK| the bath wasn't huge but it was well appointed)| with plenty of closet and storage space|  Decent lighting by which to read| which is so often not the case.  Nice| crisp sheets on a comfy bed with plenty of pillows.The radio/iphone-dock-charger next to the bed was a nice touch. The breakfast and snacks in the comfortable lobby were a real plus.  The staff were very helpful and always extremely pleasant. There are plenty of places to eat and drink nearby.  We will stay here again.,
1,Excellent Service,The hotel is beautiful| comfy| and has the best guest services. The staff was helpful no matter what we asked of them. They helped us find places to eat and gave us tips on using the subway system. The breakfast is typical of a free breakfast. The wine in the evening serves as a great time to relax from all the running around you will be doing. We used the espresso machine many times| all times of the day and night. The only negative is that they don't have ice machines on the floors. You have to get it from the front desk...so no pajama runs to the ice machine. LOL!,
5,Hotel Giraffe Park Avenue South,We spent 4 nights in this hotel from 11-15 Dec 14 and it was superb. They organised a car to pick us up at JFK before we even left UK because it was cheaper than a taxi. The staff were friendly| courteous and very helpful from the moment we arrived especially the reception staff who helped us first timers with directions and also restaurant recommendations and reservations. The room was excellent and apparently by NYC standards quite spacious. Every evening from 5pm to 8pm there was complimentary wine and cheese! The lovely Gabriella looked after everyone so we'll never allowing your glass to get empty! We are already planning to go back - highly recommended.,
24,Very nice and good located hotel,We enjoyed our stay at hotel giraffe very much. They have great hospitality and a friendly atmosphere. Their location are very good and it is near to everything on Manhattan.  The breakfast was very good and the employes was very friendly and helpful. On the afternoon it was served wine and cheese| which was a very nice after a days shopping and exploring. The one who served was also very helpful and nice. One afternoon someone played the piano in the lobby| which was nice.  The room was clean with a good size. The beds are good and you get a good night sleep| then you can enjoy the breakfast and then explore the wonderful city. ,
90,A true Gem!,Positive: - great staff! Every each of them deserves a special thank you! They will make everything they can to make you feel home. - location: close to everything| this hotel has a fantastic location. - Rooms: wow| great sized rooms for New York! - Service: brilliant! You have complementary wine and cheese every night| a lobby breakfast and many more choices to make your stay fabulous!   Negative: - housekeeping: as in every hotel and even more during holidays housekeeping could have done better. Don't take me wrong the room was clean to perfection. It's the little details that were missing. We were two in the room and during many days the room amenities were filled for one and turn down was done for one person. There has been only one unacceptable issue: on our last night our…,
5,New York for new year,Great location| rooms and staff. The breakfast and wine and cheese evenings are a great plus| the staff keep you topped up and nothing feels like too much trouble. Good size rooms for the city and ours were quiet with very little street noise. ,
113,Epitome of Customer Service,Typically stay in large hotel properties in Times Square but I have found a new favorite! Beautiful King Suite on 8th floor right on Park Ave. was very roomy| quick walk to the N train| great restaurants close by (try The Little Beet Table and Sarabeth) and quick taxi ride from Penn Station. Front desk staff could not have been more helpful| delish| bountiful and complimentary breakfast and afternoon wine & cheese| plus coffee| tea| fruit cookies throughout the day. Check out time is 1 pm which is rare but much appreciated| also ability to check bags if leaving later in the day. Definitely a return customer! Great job Hotel Giraffe Team!!,
4,Great hotel,We stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for 6 nights over the New Year period and couldn't fault it. The rooms are lovely| ours had a small balcony| staff were very friendly and the breakfast fantastic. We particularly loved the wine| cheese and nibbles on an evening| great start to an evening out. The lobby area is great to relax in and have a tea/coffee and a biscuit or two. It's centrally located and very handy for all the sights. Must mention how lovely all the girls were who served breakfast and wine every evening| particularly Gabby. They were so helpful and couldn't do enough for you.,
51,Great Boutique Hotel in NYC!,We stayed at Hotel Giraffe for 15 nights over xmas and departed on the 30th December in a Suite on the 8th Floor. Hotel Giraffe is a very small hotel| I think around 72 rooms? so did not feel chaotic like some major chains especially at breakfast times.  Yes there is only 2 lifts and yes they were slow but you get that. The room was very clean and maintained very well ( and we are very picky so it was acceptable!) We have a 4yr old so the suite was very good| our daughter was able to sleep in the separate lounge with a door that divided the lounge and the main bedroom. Yes the room was a little small compared to what we are used to Australia but it was still a great room. Even on the 8th Floor it did get a bit noisy at times| but that is NYC - a city that never sleeps! Bathroom…,
14,family holiday vacation,My favorite NYC place to stay.  This trip my son joined us and was extremely pleased with the hotel's offerings| especially the evening wine/cheese time.  It was the perfect way to wind down after a day of NYC activities.  The staff was extremely pleasant and catered to our every need...just the perfect place to stay if one wants to wind down and relax.,
2,Wonderful hotel,Our family of 5 stayed at the Giraffe for 10 nights recently over Christmas and found the Hotel Wonderful. friendly staff greeted us on our arrival and suggested we have a meal at Eataly as our room wasn't quite ready( we were early). ........... What a great suggestion that was! Rooms are spacious and spotless| comfortable beds and a great turn down service each night. Breakfast buffet was excellent with wonderful staff providing terrific service each day . The wine and cheese every evening just tops off a great place to stay. Location wonderful with subways just nearby.,
32,Great Honeymoon Hotel,We spent 4 nights here on our Honeymoon. Right from the start the staff were very helpful and friendly. We were thrilled to find a bottle of bubbly in our room too. That was a great surprise. The room is a good size and spotlessly clean. The bathroom also. The little additions of the books about giraffes on the bookshelves was a nice touch. The small balcony would be great too in warmer weather. The evening cheese and wine reception is fantastic and of a very high quality. The breakfast too of coffee| bagels| pastries and fruit is also excellent. The hotel is in a good location just a 5 minute walk from the Flatiron building. The staff were also very helpful when we asked about dinner reservations. We would highly recommend this hotel.,
1,Perfect New York hotel,This is the second time we have stayed at the Hotel Giraffe. When we visit NYC we usually stay on either the Upper West Side or Upper East Side. This fall however our daughter had rented an apartment for 4 months on Park Avenue South so we looked for a hotel that would be near her. After much research| we finally settled on the Hotel Giraffe and stayed for a long weekend in October. We liked it well enough to come back for 6 nights over the holidays. There is something indefinable about the place which grows on one and sets it apart from the more corporate hotels. We just wish we could find an equivalent in other cities we travel to!,
114,A charming hotel,The Giraffe is a lovely hotel.  It is well located in midtown and offers large comfortable rooms.  Compared to some of the trendier options it offers extremely good value for money.  The rooms are a little old fashioned| but the space makes up for the slightly shabby decor. Staff are friendly and helpful.  There is not much in the way of facilities| however| for a business trip or a short stay| the hotel is ideal.,
3,Amazing Accomodations,My first trip to NYC was truly a dream vacation| for which Hotel Giraffe played a large part.  It was very easy to access by car and the valet parking was very convenient and timely.  The location is ideal| midway in terms of Times Square and Lower Manhattan. About 15 minute walk to Times Square. Three of us stayed in the suite for three nights. Fabulous room. Very spacious and very quiet at night. Quiet from the standpoint we didn't hear the other guest in neighboring rooms| and the street level traffic was not that noticeable (we stayed on 2nd floor). The main bed was incredibly comfortable (or so I was told...as I was on the sofabed...which allowed for a decent sleep). Complimentary breakfast was very nice. Serving staff super friendly. Hotel room was very clean.  As…,
8,Comfortable stay,Me and my daughter had a lovely| comfortable stay here. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Cheese and wine in the evenings was very welcome too. Our room was just right| two double beds with a view of Park Avenue.  I had been recommended to the Hotel Giraffe by a friend and I couldn't have found better if I'd tried. I would certainly have no hesitation in recommending this place to anyone. It made our trip to New York extremely enjoyable.  Thank you. ,
9,OMG Great Hotel,"Dear TripAdvisor Friends| Please stay at this hotel. You will be so glad you did. From the start to the end of our trip| this hotel was amazing. First - we didn't check in until about 1 am. The front desk clerk gentleman was amazing. He greeted me friendly| answered all my questions| didn't make me feel like a ""tourist""| and graciously serviced all the needs I had after traveling for 20 hours. The room - upon arrival to my room| it more then met my needs. It was on the 4th floor| had a balcony overlooking the street| was clean| not super big| but exactly what I needed for a trip to NYC. It had books on what to do over Xmas in NYC| cheat sheets for cheap Broadway shows| and super comfortable bed. We had requested a Mattress topper| Memory Foam Pillow| and Coffee maker. All three…",
11,Great hotel,We loved our stay at Hotel Giraffe| our room was large with a huge bed| we were on the 9th floor and had no trouble with noise at night. All the staff were so friendly and always happy to help and offer useful advice| I think they even ended up saving us money with their insider tips! When our flight was delayed by 23hrs they were really helpful and offered us our room for the extra night without charging extortionate Christmas prices. Breakfast was just perfect to fill us up for the day| drink and fresh fruit were available throughout the day and night. The wine and cheese reception in the evening was fantastic| they certainly don't skimp on the wine. We have already recommended the hotel to our family and friends and most definitely would stay again.,
2,Affordable luxury,Excellent location . Plenty of good places to eat locally.  Services In Hotel excellent with some nice touches.  Maid service twice a day including evening where lights are left on in ambient setting| low music and chocolate.  Plenty of bottled water and a fridge for storage.  Main lounge has a baby grande piano and as Christmas during stay seasonal music played.  Cheese crackers and wine served and glasses topped up on a regular basis. Continental breakfast and tea/ coffee available 24/7.  Staff friendly and informative.  During our stay a spoke to a couple who lived in this area of New York . They stay in this hotel when returning.  If native New Yorkers visit then what more of a testimonial is needed,
170,Loved it! Better windows would have made it perfect. ,Excellent location on Park Ave South. Close to so much by foot or by subway a block away.   Very clean room| great furnishings and amenities.   Staff was so accommodating and friendly -- even the manager (Mr. Velk?) who road the elevator with us.   Great touch with the wine and cheese on week nights. And the breakfast was great as well. All served in the warm lobby.   Loved it all.   But| the elusive 5th star? Lost because the windows on Park did zippo to cut the street noise. And we were on the 7th floor.   We will still come back. Great price/value ratio.,
11,The service was exemplary,From the moment we arrived we received service second to none. We would recommend the Giraffe to anyone thinking of staying in New York and wanting the most friendly and helpful staff in town. The area is quite central and close to the shops in 5th Avenue,
11,Quaint and classy,First time staying here and we adore it! Quaint| classy| and intimate feeling in one of the busiest cities in the world. Our room was comfortable and even had a small terrace (but too cold to use it). The staff has been extremely attentive| polite| and helpful. Our room was even attended to while we were at dinner (without request). Love and will stay here again without hesitation! ,
220,Must be the best in The Big Apple,Just back from a four day stay at this fabulous hotel. Went for my nieces 18th birthday with my sister and 26 year old daughter. The staff are exceptional nothing to much trouble. The rooms are spotless with lovely bed linen. There is a fridge in your room to put drinks in and ice can be got from reception no silly extra charges for a mini bar. It is in a great location 10 mins from the Empire State Building and a couple of mins from the subway. The free cheese and unlimited wine is a nice touch every afternoon 5 till 8 you can even take it to your room. The breakfast is plentiful fresh toasted bagels and bread with boiled eggs porridge fresh fruit etc.  it would be my only place to stay if I were to return. If you book you won't be disappointed.,
93,Home from home,"Just back from five nights in New York staying at the Giraffe on ""26th and Park"" and what a great find!  From arrival to departure the staff are pleasant and helpful.  The rooms (Classic Suite) are as advertised with comfortable super kingsize bed and feather pillows (bonus point). Some road noise| but this is New York and fortunately things seemed to quieten down between 10pm and 6am| so not a huge problem.  Location in Midtown is generally quieter than the hussle and bussle North of 42nd street. Taxis are plentiful on Park Avenue so getting around is easy. Some sights are walking distance| e.g. Empire State Building is only 8 blocks North.  One really appreciated part of staying at the Giraffe is the foyer. This is where breakfast| evening nibbles and 24/7 tea/coffee and cakes…",
3,Location| service and class,my wife and stayed for two weekend nights and the Hotel Giraffe was a perfect setting for our pre-Christmas visit. The room was generous and was richly appointed and very quiet.  The breakfast bar was just right and offers excellent custom brewed coffee. The evening wine and cheese service was a great way to catch up and transition into an evening out.   Staff were always available and ready to help us - professional| efficient and friendly. There is a lot of attention to detail and the design ambience creates a special exclusive experience,
60,Great place to stay.,We could not fault this hotel. Everyone was very friendly. The Room was great |with plenty of room. Breakfast and evening Wine and cheese staff |were some of the best staff we meet. Always there to help and quickly learn what you liked and your glass was never empty!  Everyone there was there to make your stay the best they could.   Well done Hotel Giraffe,
27,excellent for a family,The two room suite was great for us!  We took our toddler along and liked the location| the happy hour and the space.  Would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone travelling with children.  The happy hour was great for a snack and a drink,
8,Wonderful Week,To anybody wishing to holiday in New York| & are unsure what hotel to pick| look no further than the Giraffe. The whole experience is faultless| the rooms are spotless & modern| the staff are amenable in every area| from understanding any special requirements| to offering you a toothbrush should you have forgotten yours. From many other hotels you will see on Tripadvisor| this place ranks as one of the best| do not even contemplate staying anywhere else in Manhattan.  The complimentary breakfasts are more than filling| as there are cereals| toast| bagels & pastries to tempt the palate| as well as fresh orange juice| tea & coffee| much healthier than a fry up at the local greasy spoon!   One member of staff that stood out from the rest was Gabby| who served the Wine & Cheese &…,
12,Intimate| classy| excellent!,The hotel greeted us warmly| check in was fast and easy.. Just what you want after a long flight! The rooms are excellent| very comfortable| up to date and always spotless.  We slept well| with only the expected city noise below at street level. The staff were excellent| always very helpful and knowledgable about the area. We had an issue with the limo company who picked us up from the airport| and this was resolved by the reception staff without delay and to our complete satisfaction.. Brilliant!  The ladies who served breakfast and evening drinks were always smiling and could not have provided better service.  The combination of fresh fruit| cereals and toasted bagels was a good start for every day.  I personally enjoyed the dining area being in the lobby area| as it is…,
6,Disappointing,Along with my 2 daughters we spent 5 nights at the Hotel Giraffe. Check in was too quick and on the edge of being rude. Front desk did improve with the gentlemen being informative and polite (the women need to learn some manners). The beds were rock hard but on request we were supplied 2 foam mattress toppers. Breakfast was good with the waitresses being very efficient| down fall was the lack of tables available. The cleaning staff were noisy and unprofessional. Location was good| being near the subway and restaurants.  Having read good reviews on tripadvisor I had expected much more.,
14,The Giraffe,"Hotel staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  The hotel and bright and clean and within walking distance of union square. The children enjoyed the fruit and cookies when they came in from a day of sightseeing. Definitely would recommend this hotel.  Special employee mention:  Jose was so pleasant to all of us; he spoke to the children every day which made them feel very ""grownup""!",
143,December in New York,Booked the Giraffe based on trip adviser reviews mainly and the location  Arrived early evening and check in staff very helpful and check in was quick and easy  Asked about somewhere to eat and was recommended Hillstone which is across the street on the corner of park and 27th excellent meal and bar has a real buzz Breakfast and the wine / cheese in the evening are a bonus  Staff are really nice and very helpfull  Rooms are comgfortable and adequate for a city hotel| ours faced Park Ave on the 3 rd floor and was a bit noisy in the evening although after much walking around NY we slept weary well  We forgot about the add ons for taxes etc so 5 nights were just short of $3000 which was fine but the taxes make the impact for certain!! There is an adjoining resteraunt but my partner…,
47,A  Treasure in NYC,We loved this small hotel! The staff was very friendly| the rooms were clean|comfortable and everyone went out of their way to make sure our visit was perfect! The breakfast was continental but was plenty for the members in our party. The wine and cheese in the evening was an added bonus. The lobby invited one to sit and read or relax in between sight seeing etc. This is a hotel we will visit again and again !,
7,Personal Touch,Was surprised by the price of the rooms at first| but when you include the awesome happy hour with free wine and a killer cheese bar as well as the free breakfast| we must have saved a few hundred dollars compared to the W Union Square. Great staff| great place.,
71,Great Hotel for Family of Four,We rented a suite for our family of four - two teenage daughters.  My husband and I slept in the bedroom and the girls were on the pull out sofa.  There was a good amount of room - which I always worry about in NYC hotels.  Free coffee drinks| breakfast| and pastries were very good.  One night we were around for the appetizers.  No complaints| I would stay there again.,
7,Hotel Giraffe,I love this hotel!  I stayed here for the first time in mid November.  It was recommended to me by a friend and everything I had heard was true.  The room( King Suite) was awesome.  The service was so friendly and helpful.  I really enjoyed the continental breakfast and the wine and cheese in the evenings.  I would highly recommend this hotel.  I hope to go back to NYC next year and I will definitely plan on staying here again.  One of the best hotel experiences I have had.,
27,Our new favorite hotel in NYC,Sometimes good things start off funny.  In this case| the hotel didn't have our room ready when we arrived.  They gave us a complimentary bottle of wine along with snacks in their lobby.  Another bottle of wine in the room.  And a room upgrade.  That's how to run a hotel.  This hotel is nicely located between Soho (shopping| of course) and Times Square| right on Park Ave. and| if you don't like cabs| 2 blocks from the 28th street subway stop.  The rooms are very tastefully decorated and also clean.  Room service for breakfast is complimentary ($5 delivery charge per person) and really very good.  Also| it's delivered in 10 minutes or less.  We got back to the hotel one evening at 6 ready to go to dinner and found cheese| crackers| crudites and other good things...and free wine…,
6,spot on!,We ve been lucky enough to have stayed in loads of hotels this year| both in the US and in the UK. Including famous destinations hotels in Vegas| local family motels in the middle of AZ and downtown business hotels in LA and London. Hotel giraffe is a real gem and probably the best we ve stayed in. Small enough to have a personality| with really high quality service from the staff and modern spotless rooms. We love the location| a couple of minutes walk to the subway and easily walkable to Times Square and midtown... Spot on they just seem to do everything just right| we ll be back again...,
24,Very Nice Hotel,My wife and I have stayed at both The Casablanca and Library Hotels which are part of the same group as The Giraffe. We love both and wanted to try The Giraffe. The standard to service was as high as the other two. The staff could not have been more accommodating and our rooms was perfect. Breakfast and the wine and cheese offerings were great. We definitely will be back!,
53,Yep| you rise above the Canopy in the Giraffe!,Our second stay at this small| boutique hotel in Murray Hill.  Very clean - great staff and service| good-sized rooms for NYC (we had a suite) and very convenient for everything we wanted to do.  You can eat a Continental breakfast (complimentary) any time you want| grab a tea or coffee and also enjoy happy hour drinks on the hotel.  We'll go back next time ...,
114,Fabulous hotel,Family of 4| kids 12 & 14.  Stayed here on recommendation on this forum and I'm so glad we did as the alternative was a Times Square hotel....this would have been hell.  Giraffe is in a great location| very easy access to subway and round the corner from the Flatiron which was an area that we really liked.  From the minute you are greeted by the guys on the door to the friendly| helpful and knowledgeable reception staff| you are made to feel special.  We were celebrating our anniversary and my daughters birthday and a lovely card| chocolates and wine were sent to our room.  Very nice touch.  The complimentary breakfast| all day drinks and cookies and evening cheese and wine just adds another tick in the box for this great place.  The breakfast and cheese/wine girls are very…,
3,Fabulous,Spacious rooms with comfortable beds make for an excellent stay in New York.  An excellent buffet breakfast is served along with complimentary wine and cheese early evening.  All of the staff are very friendly and very helpful.  I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and if travelling to New York again will definitely stay here.  We stayed in a high floor room and there was no traffic noise.  We visited the Empire State Building at night when there were no queues - amazing views.,
134,Very nice| centrally located hotel with boutique feel,"We really enjoyed the Hotel Giraffe. We originally tried to reserve a room at the Hotel Elysee but it was full.  Our previous stays at the Elysee were so perfect that we chose to book the Giraffe which is a ""sister hotel"" to the Elysee.       The Giraffe is centrally located in Manhattan and has a very friendly staff.  The wine and cheese parties were a nice social ""mingler"" each afternoon and the breakfast each morning were great.        The weather was cold when we were there (October/November 2013) so the rooftop was too cold but you can definitely see what a great asset that would be in warmer weather.         While we enjoyed the Hotel Giraffe and would give it 4-1/2 stars| I prefer the sister hotel| The Hotel Elysee at 60 E 54th St as it is closer to Central Park (which we…",
14,great location,Very nice room (balcony King Suite). Great location in walking distance to everything on South Manhatten. Lots of nice restaurants within two minutes walk. Very friendly staff. It's easy to recommend this hotel!,
20,Excellent small and friendly hotel,Forget the large chains| the Giraffe feels small and friendly. The staff are excellent and helpful| the rooms are generous| clean with very comfortable beds. The breakfast is Continental| served in the hotel lobby - not a huge choice but tasty. If you are looking for eggs and waffles you will have to go out. There are snacks available all day in the lobby and wine in the evening. Why go anywhere else?,
1,Loved the hotel,This is my first time writing a review for a hotel. LOVED Hotel Giraffe.  Upside:  helpful and welcoming staff; clean rooms; nice breakfast; comfortable lobby space.  Downside:  smallish rooms (but great storage!) and weak shower pressure.  It is NY though.  Side note:  Definitely check out the adjacent restaurant| Bread and Tulips...some of the best wood fired pizza I had anywhere!,
15,Wonderful hotel~we'll be back,I can't think of any reason why we'd ever chose another hotel in NYC. Perfect location| great staff| comfortable| quiet rooms| excellent bed & bathroom.  They've thought of everything to make your stay wonderful. From the breakfast| the all day snacks & the nightly wine & cheese with piano serenade| we felt welcomed & cared for. The best hotel experience we've had outside of the Park Hyatt in Tokyo.,
409,Great Boutique Hotel,Had the pleasure of staying here for two nights for a business conference and was very pleased with the accommodations| friendliness of staff| and the cleanliness of the entire property.   Located conveniently on Park Ave and 26th| it was just a short Uber ride from this hotel to the conference at the Apella center.   Rooms were upscale and very comfortable  - my only minor concern was the level of street noise - I guess it's to be expected at this location.,
8,Romantic Getaway!!!!,Great location in the city.  Unique boutique hotel with very friendly and attentive staff. Decor was nice| room was fairly spacious and was overlooking Park Avenue.   Lots of great restaurants nearby. Planning to go again.,
30,"New ""Home"" in NYC",Best place we've stayed in NYC. Will be our regular spot. Room immaculate| comfy-sep liked that we had a balcony (costs extra). Superb lobby with tables and couches| piano| all day food offerings of breakfast| snacks and wine and cheese. Lovely spot to sit and use internet-though free in rooms also. Staff warm and friendly-always asking if we needed anything or what they could do for us. Quick access to subway| coffee shops| restaurants and Madison Sq Park. Already reserved for January.,
2,Excellent,An easygoing| friendly and generous hotel. We were treated so well from the moment we arrived and hugged goodbye when we left. The generous coffees and muffins and cheese and wine were so welcoming Rooms were comfortable and well serviced,
8,Little Gem,First time staying at the Hotel Giraffe| and will not be my last.  Very impressed.  I was looking for a small boutique hotel| and this fits the bill. The offering of the breakfast in the am and the wine and cheese in the evening is a great touch.,
12,Fabulous stay!,"This was our second stay at the Giraffe; we were here first as a couple| then this time as a family get-away break for us with our two ""busy-mom working"" daughters. Picture this:  We arrive in New York by plane at sunset on a Friday evening. We take a cab to the hotel and walk into the lobby with a lovely piano player| complimentary wine and cheese| and a gracious welcome. Our rooms are one door apart; the balcony of one looks out on Park Avenue. The lobby feels like a private living room| with space to relax| read the paper| enjoy a breakfast bite and a cup of coffee. NO blaring tv news! The concierge arranges for our cab to the theater and dinner after (husband has food allergies to contend with.) THIS is the place to relax and enjoy New York!!!",
6,Best value in Town,We usually stay at five star hotels whenever we travel so we were a bit apprehensive when I booked a room at Hotel Giraffe for eight nights including late October - early November 2014!  We were very pleased with our experience and would stay there again when we visit NYC.  As an asthmatic| I require clean rooms with hypoallergenic linens so I requested that in advance. We were not disappointed.  The room was clean| the staff| including| but not limited to| Steve Mueller and Gabriella? (Gabby) provided superior service. Both the Continental breakfast offerings and wine and cheese reception were more than we expected.  The Bread and Tulips restaurant downstairs provided fresh and tasty dishes.  Hotel Giraffe provided a 20% discount for the restaurant.  Overall we were very…,
30,Excellent All Round,My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights and were very happy.  Rooms were clean and comfortable | all staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.  The hotel is situated in a convenient location with the metro close by.  I will definitely be staying here on our next trip to New York.,
67,Why stay anyplace else?,"So here's the deal... typically we stay at boutique hotels. We found the Hotel Giraffe and were cautiously optimistic. But now that I've stayed there I must say it's by far one of the better (if not the best) boutique hotels in NYC. The location is ideal and the rooms spacious. It's new| clean| and has exceptionally friendly staff. Everyone is accommodating from the doorman| to the desk staff| to the woman that does the turn downs. The location is great. Steps away from the ""6"" train| and within walking distance to the Flatiron district| or midtown. If you stay you can sip on complimentary wine and nibble on tasty cheese from 5 to 8pm as you are being serenaded by a piano in their awesome lobby. There also a quality coffee machine for espresso and latte's 24/7. Lots of decent…",
64,Great property| great location| only one drawback (for me;),"Great location in midtown.  Rooms are spacious (by New York standards anyway) and staff is great.  Looks brand new and rooms have sleek and modern decor.  The only downside for me is the lack of an on site gym.  You can get a pass to a gym that is three blocks away| which is not optimal when the weather is bad.  Also| if you are looking for a hip and happening ""scene""| there is no ""scene"".  No trendy bar or restaurant.  But if you are looking for a good value in mid town| you might have found your spot.",
2,Wonderful experience,We always stay here when we visit our daughter who lives in East Village. Glad it's not in Times Square! It's beautiful and we love that is is rather small. More personal! Love it! Rooms are comfortable and spacious. Service is outstanding. Great location.,
532,A very good hotel in New York,The hotel has a good location and commuting around either via public transport and/or taxis is quite easy. We booked a larger room as we stayed there with our 2 smaller kids. The hotel rooms and its amenities are all very good. The rooms were with breakfast included and although the breakfast selection is limited| it’s enough for a good start in the day. They also provide FOC happy hour snacks & drinks. It’s nice to come back from site seeing and have a glass or more of Prosecco before getting to the room and ready for the evening. The staff is in general very friendly and helpful. We had however on 2 occasion’s not so nice experience| but they took off USD200 from the bill and everything was fine again.   In overall| the hotel has this family atmosphere which is quite nice and…,
87,UK half term 'happy days',Booked this hotel for a double celebration|  my husbands 50th birthday and our 19th wedding anniversary.  Superb hotel accommodated my family well.  Nice bottle of red to help us celebrate accompanied with good wishes from the staff. ..always a nice touch.  The hotel is well situated not bang in the middle of hub bub but not too far out either. Flat iron just round the corner and a couple blocks from the Empire State.  The staff were very helpful and always courteous.  The continental breakfast was sufficient for the start of the day and the cheese and wine was plentiful.  Definitely would recommend this hotel to friends and family and I hope to return someday.,
16,Lovely hotel,My husband and I stayed here for a weekend getaway and truly enjoyed ourselves. The hotel is centrally located which makes it easy to walk to many attractions. They offer a wine and cheese reception every evening as well as a lovely breakfast with lots of choices. The area is noisy but hello we are in the town that never sleeps! I highly recommend the Hotel Giraffe and hope to visit again soon!,
238,Small Intimate Hotel in Grammercy Area,This is a wonderful hotel!  The rooms are relatively spacious with very large windows that provide huge amounts of light. The hotel has a small intimate| comfortable lobby where you can make yourself espresso or lattes throughout the day.  From 5 pm to 8 pm| they provide a complimentary cheese and wine reception for guests.  The lady who served the wines was incredibly friendly and provided amazing service.  Breakfast is included in the room price.  We really liked the fact that| although expensive| the room price includes breakfast| coffee| water bottles in the rooms| wifi and the wine and cheese in the afternoon.  You don't feel like you are being charged for every additional amenity.  For lunch| the hotel provided a 20% coupon to a restaurant downstairs.  We will be returning!,
19,Perfect Fall Weekend in NYC,From the rooftop deck| to the balcony in our room| the breakfast with coffee| just how I liked it| the wine and cheese every night and amazingly attentive staff| I would rate the Hotel Giraffe on my top 5 anywhere and will plan to make this a yearly getaway.  It's the first time I have stayed in New York City and not felt like I was 'nickeled and dimed'.  Loved everything about it and look forward to next year!,
2,A lovely home away from home!,The service| amenities| food and room were perfect. I would definitely return to this gem on Park Avenue. The breakfast was perfect| as were the fruit| pastries and coffees that were always available. The staff could not have been nicer!,
23,Excellent family hotel| great location,We just enjoyed a great stay at the Hotel Giraffe with our teenagers.  The hotel is ideally located close to lots of major attractions and a subway station but out of the madness of many other hotels closer to Times Square.  We were on the 12th floor and really didn't suffer from traffic noise at all| maybe lower is louder but you have to accept that you are visiting a major city and traffic noise can only be expected.  Rooms were good| comfy beds and plenty of space (again| bearing in mind that you are in a densely populated city)| clean and well-decorated.  Free breakfast is a real bonus when travelling with permanently hungry teenagers.  Happy hour was another favourite and we loved coming back in the evening to a glass (or two) of prosecco and a range of tasty nibbles.  All…,
1,346,Great Location to visit Manhattan,We have visited Manhattan multiple times and always try to choose different hotels depending on our itinerary.  Hotel Giraffe intrigued us based on rates and Trip Advisor reviews.  We were not disappointed.  Granted| it's not the most luxurious or amenity-laden hotel| but it's positives far outweighted any negatives.  We spent little time in the hotel and used it as our home base.  I must say that the hotel was great with regard to access to subway| taxi| and nearby locations we wanted to experience (i.e. Eately| Spin| coffee shops| etc.).  We could also walk if we chose to uptown locations.  It also had Sarabeth's on the same corner of the block| and that was also a big plus for breakfast.  Oh yes| there was a drugstore and a Bank of America within one block as well.  While…
1,Perfect location| terrific staff| great rooms| fab brekky AND wine and cheese!,A brilliant find that lived up to the rave reviews given by others. Fantastic location| close to all the great sites and with loads of great eateries on the doorstep. Staff couldn't have been more welcoming| helpful and friendly. Rooms very comfortable and spacious. ,
3,What a Gem,Delighted with our choice of hotel for our visit to New York. A friendly atmosphere was noticeable as soon as we arrived to check in. The staff made us feel important to them and this was to last throughout our stay. A lovely continental breakfast was included with an excellent fresh fruit salad. A bonus was the wine and cheese reception between 5 and 8 each evening. A wonderful hotel small enough to care about it's guests. Don't forget to see the giraffe on the top floor terrace!,
15,superb!,"I stayed here with my niece last November and we had the best time.  we felt ""in the middle of things""| did lots of walking and sight seeing.  always taxied back to complete relaxation.  the rooms are comfortable| nice bathroom.  I really enjoyed the lobby/breakfast/coffee/wine and cheese.  I recommend this hotel to anyone who asks or tells me they are thinking of going to NYC.  I hope to return with my other nieces soon.",
26,A great place to stay,Friendly staff and welcoming atmosphere makes it a great place to stay. Good size comfortable rooms| a perfect breakfast to start the day|  The complimentary drinks and snacks all day and wine and cheese in the evening are ideal when taking a break back at the hotel between sight seeing.  Great wifi.,
23,Wonderful stay,I travelled with my daughter to celebrate her 21st & was not disappointed. The staff are a credit to the hotel - attentive| friendly & so helpful. The buffet style breakfast was fresh and appetising & we especially enjoyed the cheese & wine each evening. Also so nice to come back later to grab late night refreshment & treats! The room was large & comfortable| and serviced beautifully. Also in a great position| close enough to be able to walk to many of the great sights but in a lovely place close to local parks for a quiet moment. i wouldn't hesitate to recommend to all| whether for pleasure or business. Well done Hotel Giraffe!,
12,Fantastic!,There are few superlatives that can be used to describe Hotel Giraffe - wonderful staff| friendly| helpful| beautiful rooms and the care for guest is second to one. Room service is exceptional| the cheese and wine reception each evening is relaxed and generous special thanks to Gabi who looked after us wonderfully x we loved our stay here quality without stuffiness - nothing was too much trouble thank you Hotel Giraffe we had a brilliant time hope to be back x,
18,A wonderful hotel!,A wonderful hotel| with wonderful| helpful staff. The concierges couldn't be more helpful and Gaby's a star during cheese & wine evening| remembering everyone's tipple and keeping the prosecco topped up. Lovely complementary breakfast served over a few hours to suit early risers or late starts. For me there were only 2 drawbacks - both of which were really out of the hotels control: there is lots of traffic noise (we were on the 6th floor)| but the earplugs offered at reception did help. Secondly| we had a beautiful suite with a master bedroom and pull out double for our teenage daughters; the bathroom however| is off the living room| and if| like me| you need to use it during the night| the massive glass door ensures the light wakes everyone in the suite. I'm not a great lover…,
62,Outstanding In every way,We chose this hotel after much careful consideration. Given the level of competition in NYC the overall service from all staff at this hotel is simply wonderful. Nothing was too much trouble...taxis| boarding passes| bar suggestions etc. Great breakfast and wine reception every evening. This hotel is hard to beat!,
4,Wonderful stay,Great area and wonderful staff members.  We thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of our stay.  The evening cocktail hour was lovely and our bartender remembered our drinks each night of our stay.  We also enjoyed our breakfast each morning.  We had a nice balcony looking out onto 23rd.  The hotel was very convenient for catching the subway.  We will definitely be back.,
210,Excellent choice!,We loved this hotel at the very first moment| the whole staff is very friendly and kind| the hotel is beautiful in a good location| the room is spacious and so comfortable the bed| we were welcomed with a bottle of wine and chocolates| and the view was great also. The breakfast is good and the afternoons of wine and cheese are amazing. Also you have complimentary coffee| tea and fruit all day at the lobby which is awesome. I'll definitely comeback!,
60,One of our favorites!,We recently stayed at Hotel Giraffe based on Tripadvisor users recommendations and we loved it!  We are in the city often and usually frequent the Distrkt hotel| The Muse and a couple of the Affinia properties!   We loved this property!  It is very close and convenient to most everything... with the exception of Central Park  (although we never mind walking!)  Check-in was very nice and quick...  the lobby is comfortable and quaint and also used for breakfast in the morning.  We didn't partake of the breakfast but I did have coffee...  but it looked very  nice for a continental breakfast.  I noticed many pastries| fresh fruit| cereals and breads/toast/etc..    They have a complimentary wine/cheese reception in the evening as well which is a very nice touch after hours of roaming…,
82,Love this place,Clean| amazingly friendly staff| very prompt service| great continental breakfast| answers when you call them| very nice room/bathroom/overall wonderful place. Only downside a long walk to Central Park but subway entrances close by. Definitely worth staying at compared to other NYC hotels. Would definitely go back!,
10,Great hotel,Stayed here for our honeymoon and loved every minute. Room was beautiful and had a small balcony overlooking Park Avenue South. Loved the breakfast and wine and cheese in the evening. Very close to subway and in a great area to get to all areas of the city. All staff we met were professional| friendly and extremely helpful. ,
154,good location and friendly staff,We have stayed at the hotel for nine nights and very pleased to be there. Good location| complementary breakfast and complementary wine and cheese hours and friandly staff especially Mrs Gabriella were remarkable. For more quiet nights you must choose upper floors then 6| and the breakfast could be better. Perfect for cost effectiveness.,
39,Blocked Emergency Route!,I'll split this into two sections| pros and cons.  Pros Generally very good. Location is good. Loads of channels on the television. We had a suite so didn't expect it to be small and were pleased that it wasn't - there was even room for a huge table which did clutter the room a bit until we moved it out of the way. Breakfast was excellent as was the afternoon cheese and wine. The staff serving were helpful an unobtrusive. The bed was nice and comfortable with decent pillows so we slept well. Cons There was A LOT of noise from the water pipes but thankfully it didn't occur overnight.  I just hope there is never an emergency at the hotel as| because we were only two flights up and the lifts took a long time| we mostly went down the stairs. The stairs are also the emergency…,
180,A really great hotel| big rooms cool ambience,I have stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and it was really cool. the room was large clean and the bad was great. Its much larger then hotel rooms i have usually seen in New York.  the complementary breakfast is simple but just what you need in the morning. every day from 5 to 8 there are snacks and excellent wine with a pianist playing classics on the grand piano in the cosy lobby. i will most certainly come back. don't mind the reviews complaining about noise the room was quite even though  it was facing the street| i slept like a baby. Will most certainly come again.,
39,Hotel Giraffe ... the perfect gem in the Gramercy area of New York !,I am rather fussy about hotel accommodation ... to me it is not merely a place I go to sleep ... it has to be like home and better; otherwise why would I have left the comforts of home in the first place!  Cleanliness is also of utmost importance!  I booked Hotel Giraffe based on its ratings and reviews.   And now| after having stayed there for 7 nights from 14 to 21 October 2014| I can definitely say that the hotel delivers on everything their website says.  Our Classic King Suite was well-appointed| comfortable and very clean. Included in the rate is a lovely continental breakfast; together with their complimentary 24-hour availability of coffee/tea and biscuits/cakes.  The daily early-evening cheese & wine is also lovely ... a perfect refuel before heading out to dinner!  The…,
109,Nice hotel in good location,This hotel is a nice choice if you are visiting NYC with your family. Both breakfast and wifi are included in the rate and are very good| the location is good for visiting many touristic sights| and the staff is nice. They also serve complimentary cheese and wine in the evenings| which is a nice touch. We had a suite with veranda| which was good for 3 people| with a lot of closet space and free water bottles. The only thing is I found it a bit expensive for a 4-star hotel| but this is NYC. I don't think I will be staying there again| but it was a good experience.,
22,Sticking my Neck Out.....Hotel Giraffe is Great!,This was my first time staying in one of the Library Hotel Collection properties and I was very pleased. I thought the rooms were good size for NYC and the hotel was very quiet. There are 12 floors and only about 6-7 rooms per floor| so it isn't a cavernous hotel by any means. There is a small reception desk and a nice lobby area that offered tables and chairs| couch seating| piano and pianist during the cocktail hours and a station where continental breakfast| cocktail snacks and nibbles were available.  There is no restaurant| bar or room service available through the hotel. There is an inside entrance to a basement restaurant located next door| but it isn't connected to the hotel in any way other than the restaurant offers a 20% meal discount to hotel guests. There is an…,
2,617,Everything is true - this is the hotel to book.,We just spent a week in room 405 which is a double room. At first glance the hotel room is ok| but nothing special| but as others have stated it is so cosy| very clean and just so weel thought trough that it really grow on you| and we came to love getting back to the room every day. Having the french balcony was a real plus as the good weather would make it possible to have them open when we got home and added to the charm.  The breakfast was just was we needed| and I must say that they really prioritizes quality over quantity. The bakery items was really really good and the coffee/espresso machine made really good latte.  We did not attend the evening sessions very often| but when we did we were surprised aging by the selection og cheeses as they were always very good and…
23,We never stay anywhere else!,This was our fourth stay at the Hotel Giraffe and it gets better every time! My daughter and I travel to New York every Fall for a few days of shopping| theater| museums and food. The Hotel Giraffe is the perfect spot for us! It is small and cozy with personalized service and very comfortable rooms. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast is simple but very nice. If you need something more substantial| there is always Sarabeth's which is right up the street. This is a wonderful location| right on the Lexington subway line with easy access to taxis as well. Whether you want to go uptown or downtown| you are only minutes away when you stay at the Hotel Giraffe. Highly recommended!,
31,Lovely hotel| great staff,This was our second stay at the Giraffe and it was just as good as the first. Great location| comfortable room and professional| friendly staff that make you feel welcome. We particularly enjoyed the cheese and wine each evening!,
20,Favorite hotel in New York City,I travel to NY to visit family at least twice a year.  Love staying at the Hotel Giraffe.  Beds are so comfortable.  The hotel is quite small so you don't feel lost in the shuffle.  Breakfast is free in the morning in the lobby.  Great coffee.  We always get a suite.  Pull out sofa bed is quite comfortable.  Rooms are larger than average.  Great location. Easy to find taxis.  Love their little balconies.,
2,Everything we expected. And better.,Romantic weekend getaway. Hotel is well-located in the center of Manhattan and close to subway. Great staff overall and the breakfast and wine/cheese are a nice touch| so you don't have to go out each time to find food/drinks.,
16,Excellent stay,I loved my one-night stay here. The service was excellent| the room was large by NYC standards| they host an afternoon reception and provide breakfast| and the location was perfect. I've stayed in many NYC hotels and Hotel Giraffe is my new favorite.,
17,Great staff !!,Wonderful hotel with a good location and great staff .Every day between 5-7 there is a wine and cheese and the staff would do there best to make you feel at home |but there was one server named Laura that was amazing | thanks Laura ! Otherwise enough cannot be said at how professional and welcoming everyone was .Great choice .,
1,Second full week stay we love Hotel Giraffe and staff btw our son lives near and grandchild stayed no problems,See above this was our second full week stay in last two years our son live near and older grandchild visited us at HG staff friendly location stellar perfect I have to honestly praise even knowing HG can only get too popular ,
131,Brilliant hotel - don' stay anywhere else,"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for 6 nights.  The room was a good size and spotless.  Our room was on the 11th floor so it was nice and quiet.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the addition of a ""sleep menu"" including eye masks| ear plugs| etc. was a nice touch.  The rest of the hotel was also great.  The roof top garden was usually quiet - we had it to ourselves on a few occasions.  It was great to take a glass of complimentary prosecco up in the late afternoon / early evening.  There was also complimentary wine| cheese and snacks available downstairs from 5pm to 8pm each day.  This was the perfect interlude after walking around all day and before going out in the evening.  We found the staff at the hotel to be warm and helpful.  In particular| the two…",
156,Not much Has Changed,"Hotel Giraffe was just like I remembered| literally| nothing has changed.  Hotel keeps the property nicely| but it could use a facelift.  The bed was much more comfortable than I remembered| so maybe that area has received some much needed attention.  Pro's: - Good Location - Nice Room terrace - Good Temp Control - Scale in room| robe and slippers - Continental Lobby breakfast - gratis  - David at front ""window""| went out of his way to help me source a restaurant. - two ladies managing breakfast/coffee counter - incredibly delightful| helpful| and human  Needs Improvement - Decor - restaurant/ lounge - service.  Requested coffee maker at front desk| never got it. - shower/bath - poor drain| took shower/foot bath - tv reception| none the first night - missed the Blacklist|…",
2,An Oasis of Calm,From the attentive and helpful staff to the well appointed room| everything was excellent. We loved the complimentary cheese and wine between 5-8pm which either set us up nicely before we went out to eat or offered and oasis of calm after walking round New York all day. We don't have a bad word to say about this hotel. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff| the location means that most things are accessible| (although if you want to go up to Central Park area then taking the subway is a quicker option than walking)| breakfast is included as is coffee all day (if you want it)| and have I mentioned the friendly staff!!!! Our room had a queen bed so I suspect wasn't as big as many of the other rooms in the hotel but it was bigger than other hotel rooms we have stayed in in New…,
4,Wonderful Respite,The hotel was an oasis in New York for us.Loved everything about it! They made it feel like home with the food and drink in the lobby and the welcoming staff. We would definitely go back! While it isn't right around the corner from Central Park| it is half way between the Park and Soho/ Grenwich Village. We are walkers| so the location was perfect!,
32,Spacious and great location,Had a 3 night stay. Boutique European style hotel with large comfortable although somewhat aging decor| great location near Madison Square Park| Eataly| restaurants and bars| not far from Chelsea area or Union Square Park| and easy subway access. Elevator is located just past the front desk so feels safe.   A continental breakfast is included downstairs in a comfortable window-filled lobby area which also has coffee| tea| and snacks available all day (although the restaurant is not quite on site but next door and accessible by elevator). Staff is friendly and helpful. Rooms are a bit noisy as windows are not well insulated and there is a lot of street noise from Park Avenue. Overall a good choice although you will pay somewhat more for the location and size of rooms.,
6,Our two night stay...,We loved the location| the room| the continental breakfast| the unlimited delicious coffee all day long| and nightly cheese and wine. The king bed room with a separate seating area was so very comfortable| especially after walking all over the city.  The lobby area was beautiful| comfortable| and an excellent place for conversation with visiting family member.  We will definitely choose this hotel over any other when visiting NYC!,
14,Perfect,This hotel doesn't need my review because it basically going to say the same great things as everyone else. However if I was ever going back to New York I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else. My wife and I came here on honeymoon and it was fantastic. This was the perfect location within walking distance of so many of the must see places. The staff are fantastic with everyone of them I spoke to being so helpful and pleasant. Nothing was too much hassle for them and everything was done with a smile on their faces. The bed was so comfortable. The breakfast was great each morning and the wine and cheese in the evening was a really nice touch ( and included)!!!!! Our room was spotless and it was serviced each day. I can't pick the highlight of this hotel because it was all…,
74,Great hotel| great staff| convenient location,We stayed here for 10 nights in a king suite on the 10th floor. From the warm welcome at the front door through check in and onto the support staff the emphasis was on service and making our stay pleasant. The room was very comfortable| modern and always neat and tidy. Given the length of our stay| storage was probably a little light but that was a minor issue. You get your choice of pillows| have a very comfortable king size bed and a reasonable level of noise dampening| remembering you are in NYC. The blinds kept things dark early in the morning although generally the room was on the dark side anyway. Breakfast is included in the price and is relatively simple although good in quality with bagels| cereals and fruit. The evening cocktail session for 3 hours every night was also…,
7,Friendly| well presented,Staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms well sized with plenty of natural light 2 good restaurents next door Enjoyed the happy hour each evening Bed very comfortable Easy access to grand central train station and underground train system,
1,?,Nice hotel with nice people. Very good location  walking distanse to many restaurants  and shoppingcenter| and most of the districts. Very nice roofgarden with cold refreshments and service in the evening.,
22,A great spot in New York,"Very nice rooms - clean and very well appointed. The staff were marvelous - friendly| attentive| and really helpful. The mid-town / nomad location is a little out of the way| but the hotel is a block from the Lexington subway line| and getting around is not a problem. The complimentary continental breakfast in the morning was a nice start to the day| and the wine & cheese in the evenings was a terrific way to unwind before heading out to dinner or a show. Along with the complimentary breakfast and wine & cheese| on-property wifi was included - I really appreciated not getting ""nickel & dimed"" for those amenities.",
5,Excellent Hotel,Great location| helpful staff| lovely room with nice liinen and good bed| breakfast fresh and tasty| good atmosphere with happy hour  wine and nibblies and piano.  Recommending to all my friends would definitely stay there again.  Added to my amazing stay in New York City.,
6,Another wonderful stay at the Giraffe,The first thing you encounter when staying at the Giraffe is the incredibly friendly staff who act like they know you and are happy to see you again (even if you've never met)! The next impression is of the warm and welcoming lobby with 24-hour refreshments. Next| you go to your CLEAN| bright room| with its comfortable bed| large bathroom| and fridge (that you can actually use without fear of moving a $25 bottle of coca-cola and finding it on your bill the next day!). Everything about the Giraffe is perfect!,
11,Clean and Comfortable,We enjoyed staying here. It was very clean and comfortable. Service was friendly and helpful. Location was good - only 2 minutes to subway and plenty of places to eat nearby. It may be pricey but it was worth in staying somewhere nice and comfortable. I wouldn't mind to go back again.,
37,Location| staff| breakfast and room GREAT,Hotel Giraffe location in midtown is excellent to get anywhere.  Cabs are easy and subway within 2 minutes!  Staff is great.  Super helpful with directions and they upgraded us to a fabulous suite!  Breakfast lasts until 10:30 so you can go for a run and still not miss breakfast!  Bagels| fruit are fresh and delicious.  Room was spotless.  Unfortunately we missed the happy hour each night because we were out.,
39,Great hotel,We stayed at Hotel Giraffe a few weeks ago on a trip to NYC. We chose the hotel based on recommebdations on Trip Advisor. The hotel is on Park Avenue South| its a central location and away from the trashy| touristy areas of midtown. The hotel itself is clean and comfortable and the staff are wonderful.  A buffet Breakfast is included| although i would recommend Seraphina's restaurant| a couple of blocks uptown for brunch. Early evening| wine and cheese is served| which is a welcome after a long day walking the length and breath of the island.    Its my forth time in NYC and i have stayed at the Washington Square Hotel - charming and great Greenwich Village location| a Comfort Inn in Midtown - ok and the Empire Hotel on the upper west side.  Hotel Giraffe is a great| central…,
76,Super Hotel,Stayed here with friends who had been before.  Great hotel| great staff| lovely room with comfortable bed| cheese and wine in the evening and a lovely breakfast etc etc.  Can't fault it and would go back again.,
15,Brilliant,Lovely wee hotel| staff are so friendly and helpful. Breakfast was nt what I was expecting no meat at all hot or cold! But then my wife booked it so maybe that was right. Anyway we thought the location was great able to use all the modes of transport from the hotel. Plenty of walking some nice bars and fancy resturants near by. Thanks again guys,
64,Nice friendly hotel with wine and cheese!,We spent a few days here and loved our stay.  The rooms aren't huge| but by NYC standards this is the norm I guess. They were well appointed and quiet despite facing the road. The cheese and wine from late afternoon was a great bonus and a good warm-up before an evening out.   Breakfast is included albeit of limited choice| but you can always go elsewhere if you need more variety. You should definitely try the attached Italian restaurant| we didn't try it until the last night thinking it was going to be a run of the mill hotel restaurant but it was very good. The cocktails were especially good!,
1,Hotel Giraffe is a good place to stay,I recommend this hotel because of the excellent| friendly staff| good quality breakfasts which are included in the tariff| and convenient location to subways. The staff in particular were outstanding| and made every effort to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable.,
682,Great hotel for enjoying NYC,We spent a whole week at Hotel Giraffe. 6th Floor| King Suite. We loved this hotel.  Highlights: * lovely decor in public areas and room * balcony allowing you to watch the goings on along Park Avenue day and night * the complimentary wine and cheese 5pm to 8pm| perfect for glass of wine (or two) before going out for dinner * nice| simple breakfast (awesome fresh bagels) * very friendly and helpful team * speedy wifi * good aircon * strong shower * perfect location for exploring NYC.  We loved our stay in NYC and a week in Hotel Giraffe was wonderful.,
9,Great Hotel!,We stayed at Hotel Giraffe at the end of August. Hotel was clean and the staff were great; particularly JR and Gabrielle on Reception for their great restaurant suggestions and Gabi on breakfast/cheese and wine. Would definitely stay here again.,
2,GREAT EXPERIENCE| GREAT HOTEL!!!,Visiting from Scotland and we stayed at Hotel Giraffe from 30th Aug 2014 - 9th September 2014 (10days)   This was our first time visiting NYC and we came for our Wedding & Honeymoon| we were married on 5th September in Brooklyn  Before we came to NYC I had emailed the hotel regarding a number of wedding questions and the communication from the hotel was very quick and helpful to our plans. I doubt we couldn't have picked a better hotel to stay at during our trip. Our room was a lovely spacious Balcony Guestroom with 1 King Bed which was clean and VERY comfortable. The breakfast| snacks| wine & cheese were wonderful and the hotel WiFi was great and very fast. The staff could not have been better| friendlier or more helpful throughout our entire stay. Great location for heading…,
105,Stop searching| stay at this hotel in NY!,I was looking for an hotel clean| clear| with a big bathroom counter top and a big window. Gladly| this search lead me to the Hotel Giraffe. It has all this and MUCH more! It is new| romantic| stylish| perfect decorated. The staff is very kind and helpful. The room and bathroom are very big for NY city. There are plenty of room for your clothes. Everything make you feel special at this hotel. Breakfast is wonderful| simple| but it has everything you need. The coffee is delicious. They have also a happy hour with free cheeses| vegetables| wine and prosecco. They don't have a fitness room at the hotel| but they will give you a free pass for a gym two blocks away. It is quiet| at a nice neighbourhood. I would say| the breakfast should start at 6 am| and sometimes we could listen…,
87,A calm oasis in our New York Stay,A small| chic hotel in New York. Rooms are quite shabby chic with noisy air-con and as our room overlooked Park Ave it was also noisy.   Having read the reviews before staying I am ashamed to say my first impressions were a bit disappointed but as our stay progressed the hotel really grew on me. It was a relaxed| chilled| friendly| calm oasis in the fantastic chaos of New York.   No problems check in|check out| elevators| breakfast| cheese and wine. All in all a really good set up which complements NYC fantastically well.,
132,Great Hotel and Location,This was our first time staying in the Flatiron area (we usually stay near Central Park) and we will stay here again and again.  Hotel giraffe is a wonderful boutique hotel| perfectly situated near Chelsea| Madison Square Park and Penn Station.  We enjoyed walking around the neighborhood and there were excellent restaurants all within walking distance.  The hotel provides free WIFI| free bottled water| free breakfast and a snack bar (in the lobby) that is availabel 24 hours a day.  No extra costs for every little thing.  The rooms are well appointed and modern.  The bar on the 12th floor is a must do.,
32,A Gem in NYC,We stayed at Hotel Giraffe over Labor Day weekend while we attended the US Open.  I was concerned about the location| but the subway was very close so the location was not a factor at all.  In fact| it allowed us to explore some great areas of town that we had not explored before.  The staff is friendly and efficient| the rooms were spotless| and were a great size for NYC.  We were celebrating our anniversary| and were greeted with a note from the staff and a complimentary bottle of wine. We loved the breakfasts of breads| cereal| fresh fruit| yogurts| etc.  The cocktail hour with the complimentary wine| cheese and crackers is a great way to unwind from the day before going out at night.  The room was serviced twice a day| with complimentary water and evening chocolates.  There…,
1,We both like the hotel we will recommend to our friends about this hotel,There is no TV guide book in the room| so we did not watch TV much. It took us a while to find the guides from TV.       We have given the tips to the staff of the hotel which we were happy because they did their jobs very well.       ,
39,Awesome stay,We stayed here mid July as a family of four (2 boys aged 14 and 12). I found this hotel by going on tripadvisor and seeing the highest rated hotels.  All the reviews were great to amazing.  And I have to say they are all right.  The place was great.  A smaller boutique hotel with about 50 rooms.  The rooms were clean| up to date | great amenities.   We had a jr suite that looked over Park Ave and it was wonderful.  The breakfast was a continental type with many options.  The wine and cheese in the evening was great as it allowed us some down time before we got changed to go out for dinner.  The location was close enough but also far enough away from all the touristy areas.  There was a subway line which was on block away and very easy to use.  I will definitely return to this…,
1,Amazing hotel and staff,My wife and myself along with our friends would like to thank the Giraffe hotel and it's staff for an absolutely amazing stay | this hotel really does look after you from the moment you arrive till the sad point when you have to leave . The location alone does not do this hotel justice | it's the whole package where nothing seems to be a problem for them | from giving you information to making last minute restaurant and broadway show bookings for you and making  it a very happy stress free holiday . We shall certainly be returning .,
20,Fabulous NY hotel,We stayed at Hotel Giraffe for 3 nights for a NYC get away weekend.  Great location| just 2 blocks from the subway.  So easy to get around the city from the hotel.  Great service| including a pre-arrival email and phone call offering assistance with anything we might need (tickets| reservations| etc.).  The complimentary breakfast and evening wine & cheese was a lovely addition.  We would definitely stay here again.,
4,What a find in NYC,I hesitate to share this little gem of a place on Park Avenue South. Warm and welcoming with breakfast| all day coffee and cookies | and a happy hour with drinks and nibbles all included. The staff are delightful| accommodation clean and comfortable and only two blocks from the Subway. Will certainly return.,
23,Wonderful stay at Hotel Giraffe,Spent 2 days in Manhattan visiting our son and close family. The Hotel Giraffe was in a perfect location for us to walk to restaurants and parks. The staff was extremely helpful even before our arrival answering questions| suggesting restaurants and making difficult to obtain brunch reservations. BTW they were excellent suggestions! Dinner at Bread and Tulips was also very good. Appreciated amenities (included!) are the breakfast spread and the evening wine and cheese!  They even had cookies out for night!  Also| beautiful and relaxing rooftop patio!  We will definitely return!,
18,Proseco on rooftop terrace & Midtown at your feet... WOW,Stayed in June 2012 & after research opted for Giraffe. Absolutely perfect for 2 newbies to NYC. Very central to so much  & after breakfast in their Lobby Cafe well equipted to absorb all on offer in Manhattan. Loved the Highline| the grand art nouveau buildings such as the Villard Houses| & the atmosphere of Greenwich Village & L'il Italy...plus the other typical 'must see' sites. Drinks on the rooftop terrace ( with the Giraffe!) before heading out for Dinner...& Times Square in the evening. Return to the sumptuous bed to relax...before doing it all over again.,
202,Boutique excellence with service in NYC,Friends recommended this and I decided to try it even though it was a bit more upmarket than what I would usually stay in. The service has been excellent| the rooms are clean and very comfy and QUIET. There is a complimentary continentalish style breakfast that is all I needed as well as an espresso machine with fresh fruit & pastries available all day too. Whenever I asked for advice to get somewhere the staff provided excellent information| with a smile. Love this place,
58,Simply Great!,Honestly| We can not fault anything about this hotel. The King Bed Room with balcony| has been very comfortable for our 7 night stay. The service level has been noticeably outstanding both in the room cleaning| the evening bed turn down service| front desk| and in the lobby lounge| for both breakfast and the evening free wine and nibbles. A special mention must be made for Gabi in the lobby lounge. With great restaurants in the local area| a 15 minute walk to the Empire State Building| a 10 minute taxi ride to Times Square and the theatres| and a subway station just 2 blocks away|  it is definitely a great location too.,
136,Loved it!,This has become my fave hotel in NYC!!! Pretty room with a good size| friendly staff| wine reception and breakfast! Loved the bathroom| too. Small & cozy - everything was perfect!!! I've been to NYC over 30 times| andI usually stay with the Hilton group. However| I will definitely look for this in my future trips. Can't resist this charm and can't wait to go back:},
16,Favorite Midtown Hotel,Hotel Giraffe has become my favorite midtown hotel. My husband and I have stayed there several times in the past couple of years. The rooms are extremely comfortable| modern| and always clean thanks to the hotel's great housekeeping staff. The management and front desk personnel are courteous and friendly| and always there to help us with instructions and recommendations for nearby restaurants. We look forward to returning again during our next visit to New York!,
7,Very good hotel,We really enjoyed our stay in Giraffe. The location is very convenient for walking everywhere. There are good restaurants nearby. The subway is not too far.  It was kind of cool to use a typical NY gym on the 23rd st. We found the rooms pleasant. The decoration is a matter of taste so I will not comment on this. What makes the hotel special is that it delivers full satisfaction and the service is just perfect. Thanks a lot!,
9,Oasis in the City,What a great hotel. After seeing the reviews left by others I decided to book this hotel for our anniversary. The staff is very accommodating and pleasant. Our room was on an upper floor with balcony. Having a room with a balcony in the city adds a whole different experience. Very clean and comfortable. We are no stranger to staying at nice hotels and Hotel Giraffe ranks among the top of our list.,
49,I don't think I will stay anywhere else when visiting NYC,My girlfriends and I planned a wonderful 4 night trip to the city to celebrate our 60th birthdays. The total enjoyment of the trip began and ended with the lovely accommodations we had at the Hotel Giraffe; The staff was wonderful and attentive| our adjoining rooms with balconies and a living room were clean| bright and charming| the daily continental breakfast was substantial| The wine and cheese in early evening were perfectly served and paired  and the rooftop terrace was a welcome and delightful quiet spot for our evening nightcaps. Not quite luxurious| the hotel is beautiful with lovely finishes and décor. We enjoyed personalized service at reasonable prices.  Oh and did I mention the fabulous cappuccino and coffee available 24/7? I might have over indulged on this perk|…,
5,Excellent Hotel,Recently stayed at the Giraffe on two separate occasions in July. Brilliant accommodation| facilities and service. The provision of tea and coffee| snacks and fruit AND wine and cheese in the lounge made the stay even better. The service from the reception and lounge staff was most courteous and efficient. The reception area is clean and comfortable as are the rooms.  Breakfast was quite adequate and sufficient to keep you going until lunchtime. Loved our stay there and will definitely recommend it to friends.,
15,Lovely New York- hotel,Very nice| intimate feel hotel. We had room with small balcony and were satisfied with room size and bed. Very good attending of rooms and service. Lovely atmosphere. We were two couples travelling| perfect for couples but also families. We met quite a few. Great with free wine and snacks every afternoon. Accompanied with live piano music. The breakfast was a bit low key| I found| but ok. That is the only minor minus. ,
6,Great NYC treat,Very friendly and helpful staff.  Very courteous and clean.  Lovely lobby area with free coffee/espresso bar as well as wine and cheese with fruit after 5pm and a lovely included breakfast.  The rooms are very comfortable.  Ours had a separate living room/seating area which would be very nice for a longer stay.  Clean bathrooms and nice modern taste in decorations.  Safe in the closet.  They also provide free water bottles in the room| which I thought was a very nice touch.  WiFi included as well.,
21,Will definately recommend!,Travelled from Melbourne| Australia and arrived to a great hotel with wonderful staff. The afternoon tea everyday was fantastic and the breakfast was delicious. The rooms were quite small but comfortable. Was a bit dissapointed the roof garden was closed for the length of our stay (April 25th-30th). Apart from that| Good times! Keep up the great work.,
4,Great boutique hotel.,We enjoyed everything about our stay. This was a family trip prior to my son leaving for college. The king suite was spacious and the beds were very comfortable| including the pull out bed my son slept on. The room was beautiful with a window that opened onto Park Avenue. The breakfast in the morning was perfect before heading out for a day of sightseeing. Then we returned  for a glass of wine before heading out for dinner.  The staff was friendly and helpful. The location was also great| just a short walk to the subway and parks as well as the Highline .,
2,Highly recommended!!,We absolutely love this hotel! It's beautiful| very well managed and has an excellent staff. The amenities are very generous and of high quality. We especially enjoyed having cocktails on the balcony in our room. You will definitely enjoy your stay at Hotel Giraffe| we certainly did!,
15,A haven in New York,We had an amazing 4 nights here in a double bedded room for ourselves and 21 year old son. The room was not overly large but the beds were extremely comfortable and the room and bathroom were nicely furnished. We were on the 9th floor which was still noisy (see other reviews) but I had earplugs & the noise wasn't a problem | in fact | it was part of the thrill of being in NY.  We like tea first thing in the morning & it was easy to collect from the free 24 hour tea/coffee in the lobby.Breakfast| which is included| was great with plenty of choice| fresh fruit salad|bagels| pastries|yogurts|cereal etc. The wine and cheese was very welcome on arrival back after a busy day in the heat. The hotel is in a superb location within walking distance of the Empire State Building &…,
21,My favorite home away from home,Love this hotel. I also stayed here last summer. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. I am very into customer service. The people at the giraffe hotel are the highest on my list. The room was wonderful. I love the location. Close to everything in the heart of the city near the Empire State Building. The breakfast in the morning is superb. I love the lattes! ,
42,Fantastic Stay,We stayed in a king mini-suite with balcony overlooking Park Avenue. The rooms were light and airy and very clean. My 15 year old daughter used the pull down sofa bed for the four nights we stayed and she said it was very comfortable. The main bed was massive and also really comfortable| with a vast array of pillows to choose from! The hotel staff were super friendly but in no way were they over the top| they really made for a great stay. There was lots of choice at the continental breakfast and again the breakfast serving staff were really helpful bringing coffee to your table. The hotel has a lovely roof terrace where you can get a drink after 5pm. The only downside is the traffic noise from Park Avenue - we booked our stay months ago and requested a high floor| but got the…,
163,Consistent service every time,This is my fourth stay at Giraffe.  The service is exceptional & it really is a bargain when you consider the wonderful breakfast| wine & cheese tastings & coffee & snacks available.  We had a queen room with a small balcony but asked for a room change due to some construction & view issues.  Staff was very gracious & we were quickly moved a few floors up.  Check out was exceptionally quick.  Even received a free bottle of wine in our room.  Excellent place to stay in the city,
215,Perfect!!!,If you are looking for a great place to stay near mid-town| look no further. We found the Hotel Giraffe to be perfect| yes| perfect| in every way. Their best asset| and the hotel has many| is the staff. From the moment we entered the hotel| to the moment we checked out| we were supported and welcomed by the nicest people I have ever encountered in a hotel| anywhere. Our room was updated| very comfortable| and nicely sized; it had a balcony facing 26th street| with doors that kept most of the street noise muted. The breakfast| included in the daily rate| featured a nice variety of items| from fruit| to breads| bagels| cereal| yogurt| etc. The hotel hosts a 3 hour wine and cheese event each day| again with the price included in the room. We were within 1-4 blocks of subway stops…,
2,Another excellent stay,This was our second stay at this hotel and we were just as impressed as we were the first time we visited in April.  From reception to checkout the service was excellent.  We were only able to book a smaller room this time| but it meet our needs quite well. It had everything that we wanted including reading lights. Although directly across from the elevator| we were never bothered by any outside hallway noise.  That's one of the advantages of staying in a small hotel with only 6 rooms per floor. We especially enjoyed opening the balcony door and taking in the sights & sounds of New York.  We took advantage of both the continental breakfast and the wine and cheese service.  Sitting in the lobby sipping wine| niblling on cheese and enjoying live music is a great way to unwind…,
4,Can't really fault it,"Stayed for 3 nights in late July. Rooms were clean and comfortable. We had a balcony room and it was nice to see all the comings and goings on Park Avenue from the 7th floor. Location was good - close to Empire State Building and short walk to the water taxi for downtown (or 2 blocks to subway).   The best bit about the hotel was the breakfast and evening wine and cheese. Coming from the UK| our body clock meant we were early up and early to bed. This worked perfectly for us as we had a big breakfast at the hotel| big lunch out and about and then just the cheese and biscuits in the evening.  Special mention for JR on reception who our daughters found very amusing due to his upbeat enthusiasm - everything is ""wonderful"". Not a level of positivity that you get very often in the UK!",
8,Simply Perfect,This hotel does everything right. Friendly service| large clean rooms| and plenty of perks. We really appreciated the snacks and coffee offered during the day and the drinks and snacks in the evening. Also a very nice continental breakfast in the morning. I'm not sure there is a better place to stay in all of NYC. You can pay a lot more and have a fancier room| but that's all you'll get.       ,
4,Great hotel| recommend!,A great boutique hotel| with amazing service and localization. Rooms are spacious and super clean. The afternoon wine and cheese was a wonderful plus. It is a little far away from the Central Park and the THeatres| but was one blocl from Madison Square| where you have a Subway station that goes up Brodway| so very practical. Fully reccomend for couples| families| work|....       ,
2,Staff Go Above and Beyond! Excellent Hotel! A Gem!!,We stayed here for a week. We arrived about 9am| too early for check in| but was offered breakfast and refreshments whilst we waited. Gabi was absolutely wonderful| knowing what drink to make us at breakfast without even asking. The complimentary wine & cheese evening was wonderful and our wind glasses were frequently topped up. They ran from 5-8pm every night| and were a lovely treat after walking all day. My daughter dropped her biscuits in the elevator just as the door was closing on our way up to the room. A few minutes later| the concierge brought a new plate of biscuits up to our room for her. Absolutely wonderful! Wouldn't go anywhere else now in NY.,
79,One of the best hotel stays I have ever had,I have vacationed in many hotels in my lifetime and my stay at Hotel Giraffe was by far one of the best. The location was great| the surrounding restaurants were fantastic| the employees were always prompt and courteous and the room was exceeded my expectations. I can't wait to return.,
93,A really friendly place to stay.,We arrived after a very long journey| having had not a great experience getting out of the airport or getting to the hotel and were so relieved to be warmly greeted by the hotel staff as soon as we stumbled through the door. And in our week long stay every member of staff was the same. Breakfast was good| we did go out for the all American breakfast experience just for a change on our last day but there is a good selection of fruits| cereals| breads etc and the coffee was excellent. Teas and coffees are available in the lobby all day. If you've got a lovely husband like mine he can go down and get some and bring it back to you in bed in the mornings! The wine and cheese from 5pm - 8pm every evening is a nice touch. Prosecco too| a personal favourite| so that got a big thumbs up…,
90,Best Hotel in NY for the Price,I love this hotel! For a reasonable rate| you get fantastic service| beautiful rooms| many extras| and one of the best rooftop bars in the city! I've stayed at The Giraffe many times| for visits long and short| alone or with friends. Every single visit was perfection. The standard rooms are spacious and the suites are great. The decor throughout is contemporary and high-quality. The lobby is intimate| and a bit lively| since guests are drawn to the complimentary snacks| wine| and all-day lattes and cappuccinos. The rooftop bar| run by the restaurant at street level| is very friendly and nice| and is the perfect place to end a day in the city. Highly recommended!,
37,Perfect birthday!,My boyfriend and I stayed here for my birthday (Memorial Day Weekend) and we loved it! Our room had a balcony| and was spacious and very clean! The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. My boyfriend ordered chocolate covered strawberries and red wine and had them delivered to the room..delicious! We really enjoyed the complimentary cocktail hour every evening; accompanied with cheese| crackers| olives and other choice selections; as well as the complimentary breakfast (fresh fruit and great pastries). The front desk staff was super sweet| and knew the neighborhood well. I was craving mediterranean food and the hotel recommended ilili| and it did not disappoint! We thought the location of this hotel was great (admittedly we love to walk); Times Square| The Met| and other…,
1,Excellent hotel in Manhattan NYC,Excellent hotel located in the heart of Manhattan.  You can if you love walking get around just about all major areas.  We loved the size of our room 1007 which was high up nice street view and excellent size.  Enjoyed the turn down service every night and the calming music switched on when we arrived home from the hustle and bustle of NYC. Our next trip to New York will involve this hotel. The breakfast buffet is great and so is the 24 hour coffee / tea / water service. Did not try the wine and cheese in the evening but looked great was always on our way in/ out for dinner.  Did not have any problem with noise from the street as others have mentioned but I'm sure this was down to being tired from pounding the Manhattan streets all day!  The streets that run parallel to the…,
1,“Great hotel!”,My wife and I spent a week at this hotel for our visit to NYC in July 2014 and come back to Norway early in august. From the greeting at the entrance to checkout six days later| it was a perfect visit.  Very friendly and helpful staff.   Breakfast was first class with a choice that would cater for anyone and a nice touch was every afternoon the was cheese and wine available on a help you self basis plus there was coffee and biscuit available throughout the day. There was always a young clever lady in the reading room during breakfast that kept items well stocked and tables clean. She was also very willing to get anything you may need. It was the same during the evening wine & cheese reception. Whenever we visit NYC we will definitely stay here again!,
148,Very disappointing!!!,I've stayed in dozens of hotels in NYC and this was the worst quality sleep I can recall. We stayed overnight and can only guess by the stellar reviews that must have been given the worst room in the house| for if all rooms were like 203| The Giraffe is AWFUL!! Our room was tiny| mattress was cheap and hard| the pillows terrible & armchairs flimsy and too cheap & awkward for an average person to sit in. The toilet ran so loud and often that I was forced to turned off the water connection during the night to get some sleep!!! Even the remote was defective.  Staff were friendly but uninformed about simple matters like how much it would cost to clean a pair of jeans & other routine hotel related questions.  The elevator was ridiculously slow and while the continental breakfast was…,
3,Great hotel!,We stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for 4 nights this past July. We loved staying here. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We loved the continental breakfast and the wine/cheese every afternoon was great after a day of exploring the city. This hotel is in a perfect location within walking distance to the Empire State building and the flat iron district. We will definitely be back!,
116,Perfect,We've just had a wonderful few days at the Giraffe and can't praise it highly enough. The room was immaculate and beautifully clean and the beds were really comfortable. The staff were helpful and friendly. The complementary breakfast and cheese and wine were just the icing on the cake. We found the location handy for the Empire State Building and for the 4/5/6 subway lines. Very highly recommended.,
91,Very Good,A simple no nonsense friendly hotel in mid town (near Flatiron).  Great wine and cheese from 5-8pm and great continental breakfast served in the lobby.  Very friendly staff esp Gabi serving the above.  Irving on the door also v helpful.,
23,Atmosphere,"If you want views| bacon| bad service or poor location: find another hotel. If you want really good atmosphere| perfect service| nice breakfast| cozy ""wine and dine"" afternoons| spacy rooms: choose this hotel. Really recommendable at all levels.",
9,A real treat in New York,Nearly everything about this hotel was perfect| but the best thing was the friendly and helpful staff. Located centrally within walking distance of the Flat Iron| Empire State and Times square the hotel is relatively small and has a nice personal touch. The complimentary breakfast and cheese and wine buffet in the evening are a real bonus. A special mention has to go to the catering team and concierge| especially Gabi and Cody who stood out amongst a very strong team. I recommend this hotel to couples and families alike.,
13,Our New York hotel of choice,We have stayed at the Hotel Giraffe several times.The location of the hotel is very convenient| and we have never been bothered by traffic noise. The rooms are elegant and clean| and the staff friendly and helpful. The complimentary breakfast is fresh and delicious| and the breakfast staff is service-minded and pleasant. There is a gym available nearby for guests. We will definitely stay here again.,
48,Great Place to Stay,This is a great hotel to stay at while in NYC.  We had a luxury suite.  It was a nice size room| very clean| great service.   We stayed for 5 nights and never experienced any problems.   Great selection of complimentary coffee| water| fruits available all day.   Breakfast was always stocked well and good selections.   Wine and cheeses in the evening was fantastic.   Short walk to metro was very convenient.  HIghly recommend this property.,
18,A little gem,"We stayed at the Hotel Giraffe on the recommendation of some friends and we were not disappointed.  The hotel is ideally located and from the moment we arrived we were treated like welcomed guests.  The staff were all friendly| helpful and polite.  The room was spotlessly clean and the bed was divine!  We stayed in a junior suite and really appreciated the additional space and comfort this provided.  The complimentary breakfast was plentiful and varied;  the wine and canapes in the evening were a nice touch which we appreciated as a ""pick me up"" after a days sightseeing.  Overall we loved the Giraffe and would not hesitate to return on our next visit.",
9,Excellent hotel,We stayed at this fantastic hotel at the end of May for 6 nights. We booked the hotel after reading the reviews and were delighted. We had complimentary tea| coffee and biscuits on arrival as we were early. Tea etc available free all day. The breakfast was fresh and I enjoyed the fresh fruit salad. The hotel even had gluten free options available for me as they took the time to check dietary requirements when we booked. We had requested a small fridge which they were able to provide. The room was a good size - reviews of other hotels indicated that NY rooms were small. Complimentary toiletries. The cheese and wine in the evening was great. Gabriella looked after us particularly well- she is an asset to this hotel| always smiling and friendly| remembering our names and making us…,
2,Perfect small hotel,We stayed here for 8 nights and had a fantastic family holiday visiting New York. The location meant walking was always an option but the metro card was easy to use too.  The use of the 'lobby' for breakfast| all day tea| coffee| biscuits and the cheese and wine in the evening - all included was a great extra and the staff were extremely friendly and eager to help.  The rooms were very comfortable and the extra room in the suite very useful for a family holiday for an extended stay.,
7,The Big Apple,The staff here made me feel welcome. The room was impeccably clean. The breakfast was just what we needed to start our day| and they knew what my husband wanted and brought it to our table on the second day. I wouldn't stay anywhere else--I feel like a valued customer. ,
1,Friendly and service oriented hotel,I really like the hotel and its staff. They are friendly and seem to enjoy interacting with visitors.  Hotel is very well appointed.  I also like the lobby service with snacks and free flowing coffee.  Will be back,
2,We'll be back!,So happy we found Hotel Giraffe. Staff is friendly and attentive without being invasive. Room was very clean and compact with plenty of storage and counter areas. Small balcony with geraniums was lovely. Air conditioning was cool and refreshing. Virtually no noise from building or outside traffic.  Breakfast offered quality breads| fruit| yogurt etc Nightly wine and cheese was generous and delicious. An espresso and cookie after a day of museums and touring was perfect.  We loved the location... walked to many of our destinations. Green line 6 is an easy 3 blocks away- used it for uptown museums as well as southern points. No questions about where we will stay next year for our birthday celebration.,
8,Service and value stand out!,"I have stayed over 200 nights in NYC hotels the past 15 years and this was my first stay at Hotel Giraffe. Overall experience would be in the top of any stay. Warm and professional greeting and attire from the bell and  front desk| an unsolicited bottle of wine was delivered right after checking in by a nice young lady as a ""welcome"" ; greeted each time i arrived back to hotel; nice service during the complimentary wine and snacks in the evening and breakfast (rare to find complementary anything in a hotel anymore); very nice furnished room (Queen Standard with balcony was not a large room but very good sized for a NYC hotel) with plenty of counter room and plugs to work| drawers and closet space and cold A/C (so many of the older NYC hotels have poor A/C); free wifi and|…",
116,A little gem of a hotel,My wife and I spent 4 nights here recently and had a lovely stay. The staff go out of their way to be helpful and nothing is too much trouble. The buffet breakfast in the lobby is really good with cereals| juices| yoghurts| cakes and more and a real espresso machine also and the happy hour every evening is great. We will always be staying here when we visit New York| a lovely boutique hotel in every department.  The nearby park and the famous Eataly food hall is a 5 minute walk away and well worth visiting.,
7,Amazing!,I have been an active traveler for a few decades.  I have never written a travel review.  Mostly because I have not been moved to words for long enough to still want to write about it when I get home.  The Hotel Giraffe changed this for me this week.  I was in New York on a business trip with some colleagues.  I normally stay at Hilton's exclusively| but as of late| I have been unimpressed.  This hotel is amazing!  Absolutely Amazing!  Every request was met with sincere desire to accommodate.    All of the staff get 5 stars from me| but Gaby stands out as someone I would hire to work in one of my restaurants.  She was warm and friendly.  The Giraffe is not the norm for hotels in New York| it is truly exceptional.  I will always stay at the Giraffe when visiting New York from…,
26,All Around Excellent,From check-in to departure| very good service and accommodations for a 4 night stay.  Staff at all levels was friendly and attentive.  Perfect location - walking distance to Union Square or a very close 6 train that accesses all subway lines.  Neighborhood is perfect just for wandering; close to Gramercy| Madison Square Park| Union Square| Herald Square| Bryant Park - tons of attractions| great restaurants and interesting architecture and residential areas.  Room was very functional| quiet| well appointed and comfortable.  Breakfasts were okay - fairly standard continental| but there's a Sara Beth's within a block which is a great breakfast / brunch place and lots of other nice options nearby. Our days were very full| so we didn't get to enjoy evening festivities - something to…,
12,Perfect hotel for a trip to New York,The Giraffe Hotel was so lovely I can't imagine we would have enjoyed our visit to NYC so much if we hadn't stayed here. A small hotel so you really feel welcomed by the staff who couldn't do enough to help. We stayed with our 16 year old and it worked perfectly that we had a king size bed in one room and she slept in a comfy sofa bed in the suite area. Spotlessly clean| very comfortable and well-equipped. The hotel location is excellent and right by Madison Square for evening access to the Shake Shack and Eately and a taxi hop to the Meatpacking District for dinner. The breakfast was much bigger than expected and a real pleasure to eat. The roof bar small but trendy and we were surprised by the quality of the Italian food in the linked restaurant in the basement.  All in all…,
25,Good hotel,A very good boutique hotel. Although I wanted to book the library which was sold out then I had to settle for giraffe but I wasn't disappointed .  The library offered free cookies and drinks during the day  and cheese and wine later in the evening.  My room which was a street view is spacious with a small living room.  This is a nice decent hotel for couples and family and would definitely recommend. ,
4,Fantastic stay at Hotel Giraffe,We stayed at Hotel Giraffe for 7 nights in July and in one word it was fantastic! Fabulous 1 bed suite on the 9th floor for the 3 of us. Staff very helpful and friendly. special mention to Gabi who did breakfast and evening cheese and wine which was lovely after a long day sight seeing,
18,Fantastic hotel,We absolutely loved our stay at The Giraffe in the first week of July| 2014. From the moment we walked in we felt comfortable here as the staff were welcoming and always pleasant A point of difference for this hotel is the complementary drink they offer every evening- for us a perfect end to our busy days. The lounge hostess was exemplary in her friendliness and helpfulness| as she was serving breakfast in the mornings. We also enjoyed being so close to Madison Square Park which was only a five minute stroll away. We liked that the hotel was smaller and therefore more personal.We found the location of the Giraffe great also- easy to get from there to most places. We would definitely stay here again- a real find!,
61,Everything you need,Nice European style hotel with continental breakfast| all day coffee and snacks and a really nice roof top sitting area. We stayed on the top floor in the king suite and no balcony was necessary because the roof top patio was right outside our door. Loved the bagels in the morning as well. The location is not perfect (26th and Park) but the subway is right there on 23rd. The service| however| is perfect- attentive- quick and helpful staff.,
128,First but not the last time,Wow- couldn't wait to write this review about this great place to stay. If you don't want the craziness of Time Square but still be located close to some fantastic restaurants| parks| shopping and transportation| this is the hotel. After researching thru Trip Advisor we chose the Hotel Giraffe and were not disappointed. It is a boutique hotel with a special personality that extended to the wonderful staff. The hotel amenities| the staff| the location| rooftop outdoor space| the complimentary morning breakfast items and evening wine and cheese all add up to a special hotel stay. Thanks Giraffe !!,
253,Number one boutique hotel in NYC,"Stayed here during ""hotel week"" in early January| and consider this hotel in the City.  The service was outstanding and staff went out of their way to be helpful| plus there was an afternoon wine and cheese party for guests| great!",
28,Delightful| cozy home away from home,We have stayed here many times| and look forward to every stay because we know it's going to be as wonderful as the last. What the hotel lacks in size it more than makes up for in personalized attention and generous amenities| like the evening wine and cheese receptions and the complimentary breakfast. The location is not necessarily central| and is rather quiet on weekends (easy street parking!). The staff goes out of its way to make guests feel welcome and comfortable. Never disappointed| always delighted. Strongly Recommended!,
4,Absolutely Superb !!,It was our first time in NYC and we selected Hotel Giraffe on the basis of the reviews on Trip Advisor. The Hotel exceeded our expectations. Superb location| Fastidious cleanliness| First Class service plus all the little things to make it a pleasure to stay - Complimentary breakfast| Snacks and Wine & Cheese in the lobby| free Wifi| Complementary bottles of water in the room and replenished every day| complimentary umbrellas when it rained| limo pick-up/drop-off to airport and more. But most of all the service provided by the staff was the best I have ever experience in any hotel worldwide. Everyone was genuinely warm and helpful and went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The staff on reception where particularly helpful providing some great advice on NYC sightseeing…,
2,Best stay ever,I stayed in this hotel for one week and I have to say| it was awesome!  The staff amazingly friendly| the room very nice and clean with a balcony| the location very convenient| free perks such as breakfast and wine & cheese at night. I loved my stay and can recommend this wonderful hotel to anybody. ,
114,Great boutique hotel- with a few hick-ups,Chose This small nyc hotel After reading The many positive reviews. Oustanding service provided by all staffmembers.Our 1 bedroom suite was Good in si ze and The excellent concept of using The lobby for complimentary breakfast and evening wine and cheese was a Great hit.  The hick-ups:  Aircondition is close to The bedside| so you feel like sleeping in The middle of a polarstorm  Windows lack doubleglazing| so you Can enjoy all The sounds of New York City| Day AND night!!!!!!  We had made reservations months in advance| asking for a suite om a High Floor  They provided us with a suite on 5th floor in a 12 storey hotel!!!!???  And finally i forgot to mention that we Also booked transfer from The airport very early| but nobody showed up,
16,wonderful place| excellent value,The young staff seemed actually happy to have us; they thought of ways to make every request happen. High ceilings and a wall of window with a Juliette balcony make the room spacious. Closet doors have substantial weight and mirrors front and back; easy to check appearances. Robes and slippers are provided; very relaxing. The bathroom counter is easily six feet long and close to two feet wide and there is also a glass shelf. Hot water comes on instantly and stays hot; water pressure is very good. WiFi is free| password protected and is always available; not slow| not spotty. Housekeeping leaves clean| thick towels both morning and night. Breakfast in the Art Deco lobby is generous: baked goods| yogurt| cereals| fresh fruit| hard-cooked eggs. Coffee/tea/espresso machine is on 24…,
6,Excellent,having stayed at many of the better known hotels in NYC many times for business| Hotel Giraffe for a leisure visit was easily one of the best. The staff were excellent and the atmosphere of the hotel really pleasant. ,
5,20th Wedding Anniversary NY Hotel Giraffe,Come to NY yearly. First time staying at Hotel Giraffe. Very clean|  nice hotel. Staff incredibly nice and friendly. Breakfast is great. I will definitely be back. Best hotel so far that I have stayed in NY! Then you Hotel Giraffe for making my 20th wedding anniversary special!,
2,You won't be disappointed!,We were moving our son to NYC over the 4th of July weekend and found this hotel which was conveniently close| pleasingly quiet with nice sized clean rooms| and had a very welcoming staff and a relaxing area to enjoy their complimentary wine and cheese with piano music in the evening as well as a very good breakfast in the morning! I also wanted a hotel which offered valet parking as we had a SUV to park.,
10,280,Another great stay at the Giraffe!,Love love love this hotel!  We had a lovely king room on the 9th floor| so quiet| super clean| and relaxing.  We love that we can pop down to the lobby for breakfast| a glass of wine in the evening| or a cookie or two before bed.  I can't say enough about the staff.  All of the people we came into contact with were friendly and professional.  We can't wait to return!
30,Couldn't have had a better stay,My husband| daughter and I were in New York for a long weekend.  We had never vacationed in New York before.  We chose the Hotel Giraffe based on Trip Advisor reviews and were very pleased.  The room had a separate bedroom| with a door separating it from the living room area that had a pull-out sofa.  This combination worked well for us.  The room fronted on Park Avenue and had a tiny balcony just big enough to stand on so you could see up and down Park.  The beds were comfortable and the climate control worked well.    The thing that really set this hotel off was the friendliness of the staff.  Everyone went out of their way to make sure we were enjoying our stay. From the guys at the front desk who patiently answered our questions and always asked how things were going to the…,
3,Great staff and location!,Wow from the moment you walk in I got greeted and the wine and cheese and breakfast where great! And walking distance to the flatiron building and Eataly great gelato and italian food. Rooms very clean and nice| highly recommend it.,
37,My go to NYC Hotel,"Once again my husband and I stayed at the Hotel Giraffe as a one night date night ""vacation."" We were upgraded to the top floor suite upon arrival and the room was more than spacious.   Overall the location is great (right near 4/5/6 subway and Madison Square Park). The happy hour is nice and relaxing and the fact that there is breakfast in the morning before I'm ready to face the world is perfect. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will spend the $5 to have food delivered to my room so I can be a little lazy.  Why am I not giving the hotel a ""five?"" Two reasons. The room upgrade (which was great) was next to the outdoor deck so a little loud but not intrusive. I'm curious what it would be like on a really nice night. Secondly there were ants in the room. Very small and…",
49,Great location,Got off to a bad start when the car I'd booked through the hotel  failed to turn up at the airport.  Ended up just getting a cab. Reception were most apologetic and promised a bottle of white wine as compensation but that failed to turn up as well.  Location is very central. Empire State building is within walking distance. Times square is only a couple of subway stops away.   Didn't like the glass bathroom door. A curtain would be nice. Liked the foam mattress topper you could request.  Staff were very pleasant and helpful. There was complimentary tea/coffee throughout the day. Breakfast was OK| but no hot options. And because most of the tables were for 4 people it was sometimes a problem finding somewhere to sit. But maybe we came down at the busiest time.,
2,Very Friendly,Stayed in room 704 in which was a Classic with a king bed on a Saturday night.  Room was nice| current and roomy.  Street noise is a touch loud but its NYC.  The iHome clock radio had a cool sleep music feature built-in.    The service was excellent. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Lots of extras that were complimentary. Wine and cheese| breakfast| fruit all day and bottles of water in the room.   It is also close to the 6 train which was also helpful.   Would definitely recommend the hotel if you dont mind paying more for quality and service.,
62,Execellent hotel in a good location,We had a family gathering over 4 days & everyone loved the Giraffe.  It is a small boutique type hotel| our twin room with balcony was a reasonable size| comfy beds| good bathroom & shower (did not care for the fluted glass door as we would rather have some privacy). Short walk to subway & Union Square & Empire State Building.  What we loved best was the complimentary tea/coffee machine in the lobby along with the afternoon cakes and 5pm wine & nibbles.  Great to unwind after a hectic day in NYC (there was a piano player in the lobby each evening). The staff were brilliant with the kids| reception & concierge really helpful.  The Giraffe will be my first choice from now on.,
2,highly recommend this hotel in NYC,I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights this past week for a business meeting.  I HIGHLY recommend this for business purposes for a smaller/midsize group (25 people max) as they have a great space on their top floor (12th) with roof top patio connected to the meeting room.  However| I would also HIGHLY recommend this hotel for a personal trip also.  The rooms were a decent size (especially in NYC) for a couple to be extremely comfortable - which is not usually the case in the city.  I felt that the room rate was reasonable and the location was fantastic for Penn Station| subways| restaurants| bars| etc.  The staff was extremely kind - I especially remember Chris when he greeted me when I arrived by offering me a glass of wine after a very long day of awful travel (delays| planes|…,
2,Hotel Giraffe - our home away from home,I feel bad that its taken so long to write this review|but nearly a year on and we only have the greatest memories of this hotel.  My son and I stayed a total of 21 nights. While most of it was spent from early in the morning until late at night soaking up all there is to see and do in this wonderful city; when we did arrive back| we were always greeted warmly and with an enquiry about our day.  The hotel's team served a light breakfast each morning| welcoming and hospitable. We were on the 11th floor with a small balcony. A fridge was made available on request and the housekeeping staff were nothing short of brilliant. Thank you Hotel Giraffe for making our stay truly memorable. We hope to be back!,
1,Thank you Giraffe,The first thing we noticed when we arrived at the hotel was the knidness of the staff|always ready to help you. The room was clean and comfortable. At the end of the day we were cheered by classical music and chocolate in the hotel room :one of the things we liked best together with cheese and wine served during the aperitive.       ,
198,Perfect in every way,This hotel was recommended by a friend for very good reason.  The welcome was terrific| even before we arrived.  We had organised through the hotel for a car to collect us at the airport.  When we checked in to fly to NYC the airport was not Newark as our travel agent had posted| but rather JFK| so a quick email to the hotel and our driver was sent to the correct airport and the change confirmed with me.  We had pre arrival emails regarding any special requirements too.  The three of us booked a deluxe one bedroom suite| which had a sofa bed in the lounge area.  This was perfect for us.  The staff welcomed us effusively| and having flown from Calgary and missed lunch we took full advantage of the cheese and drinks in the lobby once we had dropped our bags in the room. As it was…,
2,My favorite hotel in NYC,Don´t even question it| I have stayed all over the city over the past 10 years and you can´t beat the Giraffe for location/price and superior service|  I don´t know how they do it| but they really surpassed all my expectations!  i´ll be back in September!,
12,Great hotel!,"My favorite in NYC.  Perfect location| very friendly and helpful staff| and wonderful ""feel""  Couldn't ask for a better experience. The breakfast and afternoon wine and cheese are great touches for this excellent hotel.  If you like the hustle and bustle of a large hotel| this is not the place for you. . . but if you like a very personal feel| try this it out.               ",
8,Great Hotel and Staff,My husband and i recently stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for 10 nights. The hotel is quite modern in style and is exceptionally clean and tidy. The breakfasts are great with plenty of choice and items that they run out of are continually replenished.   The staff are all happy to help in any way and nothing is a bother to them and they are all very friendly and approachable.  There is free tea and coffee with cookies and pastries 24/7. The wine reception between 5-8pm is excellent and there is a piano player during this time making for a very relaxed atmosphere.  The breakfast and wine reception staff are great especially Gabriella who does a great job and is very attentive without being over the top and she made our stay very enjoyable.   I thoroughly recommend this hotel and would…,
521,Fantastic Stay,We loved Hotel Giraffe.  Just spent 4 nights here July 2 - July 6.  From the amazing staff| including| but not limited to JR| Laura| Gabi| Ron| and Simona - thank you all for making our stay so fantastic.  Our room was well appointed|  on the 6th floor| with a balcony overlooking Park Avenue.  Room had everything we could possibly want.  Loved the turn down service at night complete with complimentary bottled water and chocolates.  The breakfast in the morning and the wine and cheese hours at night just complimented the rest of the stay.  Be sure to visit the outdoor patio on the 12th floor.  We will definitely recommend this hotel and will be sure to return.  We are missing the coffee machine in the lobby!  Also loved the room darkening shades and it was amazing how sound proof…,
39,Prefect..Prefect..Prefect for Families Traveling to NYC!!!,This was our first stay at Hotel Giraffe and we are counting down the days to returning. The staff was friendly and accommodating.The complementary breakfast| wine and cheese reception was excellent. Every morning we would start our day with the complementary breakfast and head out to sight see. The location was perfect: very close to Madison Square and subway lines. It's quiet and my little one was able to sleep peacefully. This hotel is super clean and the rooms are spacious. We would definitely stay here again and we would HIGHLY recommend this hotel! Thank you for helping us make wonderful memories with our kids!,
164,Perfect location| perfect hotel,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel Giraffe| a contemporary boutique hotel. We found the staff to be personable and helpful - particularly JR at the Reception Desk and Gabriella who served us morning coffee and wine and cheese in the evening.  The Hotel is clean and quiet.  The complementary breakfast and wine and cheese reception was appreciated.  The hotel is WiFi accessible.  The location was perfect:  very close to Madison Square| the Flatiron Building and other historic buildings.  Near to several subways lines.  A short walk to Eataly!  We would definitely stay there again.  No Times Square hotel experience for us!,
65,Highly Recommended,This was my first stay at the Hotel Giraffe and it was a great experience. All the staff were welcoming| friendly and went out of their way to make my stay as enjoyable and easy as possible. The front desk staff were welcoming and accommodating| the bell staff pleasant and attentive| and the breakfast staff were friendly and efficient. My room was spacious and attractively appointed. The bed and linens were comfortableI have stayed at their partner hotel the Elysee many times and the Giraffe maintains the same high standards with a lovely updated décor and ambience. I will return.,
15,An Oasis of calm in NYC,The service and accommodation was excellent at this privately owned and friendly hotel.  The room we had was of ample size and the bed was exceptionally comfortable (we did specify a Kingsize room). In the reception lounge you could slways get complimentary tea and coffee and there was wifi available throughout the building.  There is a small cocktail bar on the roof open to residents and non-residents.  There are plenty of good places to eat nearby with Eataly (try prime rib sandwich) and Lady M (try cheesecake) 'must visit' venues.,
92,Good| not great,Chose the Giraffe as a different choice for a special getaway due to reviews and location and came away a bit underwhelmed.  No complaints on the staff...always friendly and attentive.  However| lacking a bar/restaurant onsite forced us to wander out| the bed was unremarkable| even uncomfortable| the HVAC annoying| and the room just ok.  While the stay was fine| it was not memorable or offers a reason for a repeat stay.,
10,Great stay,My wife and I just returned from 3 nights at the giraffe.  It is a cozy hotel in Manhattan away from the hustle and bustle.  The rooms were clean and very comfortable.  The most important asset of this hotel is their staff.  Always a smile on their faces| never in too much of a hurry to help you and happy to be there.  We plan to come back.,
1,Wonderful hotel,Our stay was perfect from the moment we arrived.  The staff go above and beyond to help with anything one might need. The room was beautiful and the food great. This hotel is now where I will stay on future New York trips.,
8,Hotel Giraffe is worth the premium,Since ordinary N.Y. hotels can be pricey|  I was curious to see whether the premium for Hotel Giraffe would be worthwhile. It was.  Staff were pleasant and helpful. our room was great and public areas - main floor and rooftop bar - were also great. ,
25,unique and boutique,I just adore this hotel| and will continue to book a room each year for my parents' annual visit to New York City.  This time round was the best yet - we were very generously given an upgrade to a suite for the bargain price of an extra $10.   The location of Hotel Giraffe is fantastic - and hanging out on the rooftop garden on a hot summer's day - above and away from the hustle and bustle of midtown Manhattan was absolute bliss.   The staff go out of their way in their level of service... Hotel Giraffe has managed to incorporate all the comforts and amenities of a chain brand hotel| but has also created a unique| boutique atmosphere at the same time.   The complimentary cheese and wine| served to guests in the lounge each evening contributed hugely to the 'special' factor|…,
10,Wow| thank you to all the staff| you were great,Well| where to begin| we came from the uk for a 5 night break in NY| mom and dad with 11 and 14 year old lads.  From the moment we arrived at the hotel| the staff couldn't do enough to help us.  I used trip advisor to select a hotel and can only say all the positive reviews are absolutely right. We had a two double (queen) sized beds and the room for such a city was great.  The ac was superb and quiet but devilishly efficient.    There is a small amount of sound through the double glazing but this is a large metropolitan city| I didn't expect any less.  Actually| this reminded me I was in NY and no one in the family suffered from lack if sleep.  If this noise bothers you you can avail yourself of any if the many items that the hotel give out free of charge if you request them…,
31,Oasis on Park Avenue,My wife and I spent 9 days at Hotel Giraffe (arriving June 7| departing June 16th) and we would highly recommend this hotel for a splurge in New York City. We found the staff very helpful and friendly| starting with Ashley who made our arrangements and enthusiastically accommodated our special requests. Laura and Gabi were exceptional hosts for the complimentary breakfast and happy hour| and everyone made us feel like valued guests. The hotel itself is well-located at the corner of Park Avenue and 26th street; it is a 2 block walk to the Lexington (#6) subway| easy walk to many of the sites (Empire State Bldg| Flatiron Bldg| Madison Sq| Union Sq| grand central terminal| times sq.). Our King Suite was spacious| modern| quiet and cool. The relatively small size of the hotel (72…,
108,Hotel Giraffe,Wonderful boutique  hotel in downtown New York. We went for my daughter's 30th birthday. Everyone was very accommodating and pleasant. The valet was helpful when parking my car| not easy at rush hour! The wine and cheese was lovely and relaxing| the staff very helpful. The selection was great! The from was beautiful with a terrace overlooking Park Avenue South. With the door closed no road noise. Bathroom and closet space plentiful! Very comfortable bed with down pillows and comforters! Breakfast was terrific!,
131,Good hotels need not cost a fortune,The Trip Advisor reviews are correct.   Room very clean and well-equipped.  Staff professional and friendly.  Free continental breakfast in NYC!  Bed a bit too firm for my taste| but everyone prefers something different.  A great value| style| comfort| location choice.,
67,Great New York trip,Spent 4 nights in Hotel Giraffe on my recent New York visit| had looked at numerous hotels but booked here after reading other reviews.  For me it lived up to my expectations|  had a king suite on the 26th street side so very little noise| really spacious| clean and well maintained during the stay.  The breakfast service was great even when it was busy extra tables were put in the area| really great customer service from all the staff I encountered.  The location was great being a little out of the way of some of the busy spots but near enough to get around without any trouble.  I really hope to visit New York again and will definitely look to stay at Hotel Giraffe when I do.,
1,fantastic hotel,We spent 4 nights at the Hotel Giraffe in NYC. (2 adults| 2 kids) and had a fabulous time. Location is great| rooms are roomy and absolutely clean. Beds are comfy! The staff at Hotel Giraffe is very friendly and we felt 'at home'. Perfect to have a breakfast before heading out to a long day in the city. And what was best: to come back in the afternoon and be able to sit in the lobby| have a glass of wine and some nibbles free of charge. Thanks to all at Hotel Giraffe| this was truly an amazing experience and we would never consider any other hotel in NYC| should we return! Best regards.,
1,Second visit,"This is our second visit to this wonderful 72 room hotel. Centrally located at Park Ave South and 26 st. We like it being small and well kept. Staff is extremely friendly and very helpful.. Due to severe weather we arrived at the hotel a day late. We were not charged for the night which we ""missed"".",
2,Everything we hoped for,After reading the reviews| our expectations were high and the Hotel Giraffe met and exceeded them. The hotel is clean and conveniently located. The staff is friendly and helpful. We will stay here again as soon as possible.,
11,Wonderful stay,I had originally made my reservations months ago. I had a last minute change in plans| so I had to adjust the room type| which I was able to do with no issues. Upon arrival the staff were thoughtful and accomodating. One day it rained and we were ill-prepared| so the hotel provided us with umbrellas to use the entire day. JR at the front desk was so friendly and helpful. My travel companion indicated that they would never stay elsewhere in future visits to New York. The rooms were clean and comfortable| and the staff was great. It was a top notch visit. We had a great experience and hope to visit again soon.,
5,Hotel Giraffe - GREAT.,From the time I arrived at the front desk till the time I checked out five days later – My experience was pure delightful. The front deck agents were professional and helpful| the housekeepers were amazing| and the lobby staff were kind and accommodating. The Hotel Giraffe is jewel. I recommend this hotel for business travel as well as leisure travel. I would not change a thing. Great Job Staff - Great Hotel.,
1,Charming Sophistication,Hotel Giraffe is the gem in the Murray Hill area. Helpful| informed staff| lovely rooms| breakfast in the lobby and a wine hour at the end of the day. It's perfect! The location really works for anyone on business.               ,
34,Excellent choice in a good position,Excellent hotel| staff incredibly accommodating| nothing too much trouble. Would defiantly return again! Great hotel for families &  individuals alike| breakfast plus wine & cheeses included on an evening| book! You wont be disappointed with your choice.,
69,Can I live there?,We only stayed one night prior to a cruise and wanted to stay longer. The staff were incredibly helpful| professional| and pleasant.  Our junior suite was tastefully decorated and soothing. We slept so well| we both woke up and said| we have to check out this mattress! We did and are shopping for one just like it. The street noise was minimal| the evening and a.m. goodies were delightful. I'm so happy we chose this hotel. We hope to return and stay there as a base for more sightseeing in the futre.,
83,Excellent in Every way,"Great location. Great service. Lovely room. Situated in New York's NoMad District (Park Avenue South at 26th Street)| this lovely boutique hotel is close to Madison Square Park| Empire State Building| and Macy's. Area attractions also include Union Square and fine dining -- do NOT miss EATALY (across Madison Square Park at 200 5th Avenue).  Complimentary breakfast and refreshments are served all day in the Giraffe lobby including evening wine and cheese| plus free wifi. Never had to go into the mini-bar. Bread & Tulips Restaurant serves lunch and dinner and you get 20% off for staying in the hotel. Gorgeous roof garden bar (though not much of a view). We were upgraded to a corner ""Classic Suite"" - which was a good value - comfortable bedroom and a sitting room with a really nice…",
34,Fantastic hotel!,We stayed here from Tuesday to Saturday last week and we chose this hotel as part of our wedding holiday because of the excellent reviews it got and they were right!  Upon arriving and after checking in| our luggage was taken up to our room by the nice porter.  We stayed in the balcony suite with a king bed| which was huge!! The separate living room with the balcony was very spacious and you could watch the busy New York life go by from the comfort of the room. The air conditioning was very good| one in the bedroom and another in the living area. Both had HD tv's with loads of channels. The bathroom was nice and the shower was very powerful. There was a safe| minibar| complimentary water| bathrobes and slippers in the room and an umbrella (which can be borrowed also at…,
6,An excellent hotel,My daughter and I spent four nights at the Giraffe. Such a lovely hotel; very professionally run| delightful staff| very comfortable rooms and a relaxed atmosphere. We thoroughly enjoyed the breakfasts and cocktail hour after a busy day sightseeing and shopping.  I'd definitely recommend any of the hotels owned by this group.              ,
4,Great hotel| great location,Visited from UK| stayed at hotel for 8 nights last week of May. Location was great| very close to various subway stations for easy access to whole of New York City and beyond whilst being away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square. Free breakfast and Wine/Cheese evening very nice touch however a little repetitive| some variety would make this even better. Free WI-FI throughout the building was a definitely plus| great download speed and never lost connection and all in room amenities were great (fridge provided free of charge etc). Room and bathroom good size for family of three however queen size beds little smaller than expected TV channel were extensive to allow for rest after long day seeing the sights. Some city noise could be heard from the eighth floor but nothing to…,
75,Excellent Hotel in Good Location,A late review| but wanted to say how much we enjoyed our stay here. Lovely room| and so nice to have a balcony view in the city. Great neighbourhood to be in| and not noisy at all. Excellent service from the staff of course.   The best part was to have a breakfast in the morning and the cheese and wine in the evening| unusual in the US and much appreciated. It was good to have something to eat before setting off for a days sightseeing| and great to relax in the evening with a glass of wine after a hard day hitting the shops.  Highly recommend.,
6,Boutique Hotel Charm,Great location for our stay in NY| after a stressful drive into the city with my companion| we could not have been more graciously greeted| and the wine hour was a real plus! Rooms were small and it was very pricey.,
44,Return visit,After some time searching other hotels we returned to The Giraffe five years after our initial visit.  The location in Midtown is perfect if you want to be in the hustle and bustle of everything. The hotel is now located in the up and coming area of Nomad with its excellent restaurants.  Staff as always consistently courteous| helpful and professional.  The café staff warm and welcoming and the breakfast tasty and plentiful. The evening wine and cheese with pianist always a treat.  The room with balcony was very large| fantastic bed for a very fussy couple| views on to Park Avenue South and toward Madison Square Garden.  Excellent facilities| immaculate level of comfort and cleanliness.   The cost does reflect the quality of the hotel| with added tax did exceed £2|000 for seven…,
15,Short stay| but very nice,Booked this on the basis of reviews and was very pleased. So nice to have a room that is actually larger than the bed so you can move around a bit (we had a king size room) and the bathroom is pretty decent too. Staff were helpful and courteous| although they seemed to resort to google for most specific questions - which I suppose is better than guessing? Cheese and wine and nibbles in the evening is a nice touch. Would stay there again.,
13,Fantastic Experience,We stayed for six nights and had a great visit. Room was spacious and the service was efficient but also very relaxed. Great area for bars and restaurants - recommend The Grey Bar on 26th at Broadway. Will definitely return!,
336,Lives up to the expectations!,I booked this hotel based on it's TripAdvisor rating and reviews and was not disappointed. Having been I can completely understand why this place is so highly rated. It's not much to look at from the front| not what you'd call a landmark building but the WOW factor really happens when you step instead.   This hotel has some of the friendliest and most helpful staff I have ever come across. Nothing was too much trouble and you were always greeted with a sincere smile| with staff often pre-empting how they could help you - be it carrying your luggage| hailing you a cab or just filling up your water glass.   Our room was lovely| spacious and clean. The free wi-fi worked really well.  Yes there's a little noise to be heard outside at night but you are in the centre of one of the…,
1,Great experience,Staff is ready and willing to make your stay as trouble free as possible. Rooftop provides a tranquil spot to rest up for your next adventure.  Breakfast was great and the staff is there to help with toasting breads and directions with the coffee maker. ,
3,Brilliant Hotel,Spent 5 nights at the Hotel Giraffe 3rd - 8th May 2014. What a gem this hotel is. We had a Classic King Suite at the back of the hotel facing onto 26th Street. The room had everything we needed and was relatively quite. This is NYC at the end of the day and there will always be street noise. The staff are friendly and attentive| always willing to help and advise| reception staff (Simona if I recall correctly) spent 45mins making a call to arrange our return pick up for which we were very grateful. The concierges are very helpful offering advice on how to get about| particularly on the subway which is only two streets away. The girls in the breakfast lounge/bar are attentive and we found the regular evening cheese & wine to be a very nice touch| particularly after a long day of…,
1,Wonderful stay at Hotel Giraffe,We had amazing service with very friendly| helpful staff. Our room was unusually large for NYC (Classic Guestroom with king bed). Daily continental breakfast was great and daily wine/cheese reception each night was outstanding. Beautiful rooftop seating too. Couldn't have been nicer. Easy to get taxis and the subway.,
1,A Great Weekend,The Hotel Giraffe is a warm and friendly place to be.  The lobby is so comfortable and the staff is so friendly and helpful that people hang around to socialize.  The room we had was facing the street and had a small balcony.  The room and bath are lovely and very clean.  We would definitely stay here again.,
5,Great Hotel,I must have stayed in at least 250 hotels in my life for work and vacations| and Hotel Giraffe is the best of the non-resort hotels I have stayed at. We had a one bedroom suite that was large and comfortable and| very important for me| quiet. I could not hear the guests in the adjoining room| and the only street noise we heard was the sirens. The staff is extremely helpful| the breakfast is great and a time saver| and on those days we had a heavy lunch| the evening wine and snacks were enough for dinner. I have found my perfect NYC hotel and will return on our once or twice yearly visits to NYC.,
390,Absolutely Spot-on,Hotel Giraffe is lovely. The hotel is relatively small| the staff get to recognize you and go of their way to make sure your holiday runs smoothly. The concierge can offer advice on where to go| how to get there and what and what not to see. The rooms are very clean| and spacious| with a good range of quality fittings and extras (we requested an empty fridge for the room). The hotel is very well located| close to the Flatiron Building and Empire State| and only 2 short blocks away from the subway| which we used extensively to travel virtually everywhere on Manhattan island. The breakfast is simple| but perfectly adequate and coffee/tea is available all day. There is also a cheese and wine each evening| again| a simple affair| but very welcome after a day out. The success of this…,
1,excellent choice,I stayed at Giraffe with my family and it was really enjoyable stay for everybody. We liked breakfast| wine reception| and 24 hour snack service at free of charge.Location was great so we can go anywhere easily and neighborfood was also good..You can pick any kinds of restaurant | shops| etc. We'Il definitely go back to Giraffe!,
5,Nice place to stay in NYC,"I like this hotel. The staff are very efficient and pleasant and every request we made - for extra blankets| directions| recommendations  - was met with professionalism and genuine interest. The buffet breakfast is just perfect to get you going for the day| and the staff that helped out at the food area/bar  throughout the day were very accommodating| even when busy with many guests asking for coffee| toaster| etc. I found the noise from Park Avenue to be a bit much| but once we turned on the ""waves"" from the sound machine| we were able to get past some of the honking out on the street. A great| clean| well-located hotel - would stay here again.",
34,Perfect,What a great hotel.  There is a good reason why it rates so highly - basically it is spot on.  They do all the important things well and they add some extras too.  I took my wife here to celebrate her 40th birthday so I was more than usually concerned that it would fit the bill.  I need not have worried.  The welcome was great| they arranged a limo from JFK for me| and laid on a bottle of fizz for us on arrival.  The room (we booked a suite - we were on the 9th floor) was really nice| very clean| with fresh clean linen and nice towels.  They even change the shower curtain between guests.  There was a large TV in each of our rooms along with a DVD player.  Our room had a balcony out onto Park Avenue which was great - I'd cetainly recommed this room| but I've no reason to believe…,
34,Great hotel,"We stayed at The Giraffe with family members and one young child. Rooms were very comfortable with nice toiletries| bathrobes and slippers.  A buffet breakfast was included and a buffet was laid out every evening - wine and nibble.  There was a roof garden with a good view where you could take a glass of wine and enjoy the evening  sun.  The hotel was just across the road from Madison Park.   This was our first visit to New York and we had a fabulous time - the re is so much to do and see and we found everyone very helpful and friendly.  Don't miss going ""Up the Rock"" and the Natural History Museum.  I enjoyed a trip to the Guggenheim  Museum by Central Park - fit this in with a visit to Strawberry Field.",
51,Perfect Hotel in a Perfect Location,My Mum and I stayed here in December for the 5 days for our 21st and 50th Birthdays. After a long 8 hour flight| we were greeted by polite staff who helped us take our bags straight to our rooms. Our room was perfect - clean| spacious| modern and comfortable with a selection of snacks (which you had to pay for)| free wi-fi and a large flat screen TV - it felt like a home from home. The breakfast was continental complete with bread| cereal| crossiants| fruit and fresh orange juice and coffee etc etc and wine and cheese at cocktail hour was great to come back too after a long day in the City.  There is also a Mexican Restaurant called 'Dos Caminos' next to the hotel - if you love a good mexican I would definitely recommend a visit and also Bread & Tulips - we received a 20% off…,
7,At Home at Hotel Giraffe - New York,This was by far the most wonderful| boutique like hotel we stayed at. It was like being at home and greeted by friends. Good location and public transport easy. Definitely a five star rating. Thanks to all who made our stay so wonderful and always had a smile and kind word. All the extras were amazing - breakfast| drinks and nibbles all day and happy hour with complimentary wine| cheeses and yummy food awesome. There was some traffic noise though which is anywhere in New York New York. Loved it and recommend the stay. 15 minute walk to Times Square. It was good to stay away from the chaos. Transport on the metro easy. Thanks to all the wonderful staff at Hotel Giraffe for making us feel valued and at home|I have recommended it to friends. I was delighted to find that Mr. Big…,
1,Perfect location for a weekend getaway!,My husband and I stayed here over Memorial Day weekend ad had a wonderful time. Rooms were clean| stylish| and comfortable and the staff were discreet but helpful. We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast as well as the wine and cheese offerings in the evenings-it worked out perfectly as a title snack before seeing a show. The location was great for us as a base for exploring all of favorite parts of the city. Definitely would stay here again. ,
15,All we would wish it to be!,We have thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night stay at Hotel Giraffe.  Our room was spacious and as we expected| very clean and the bed extremely comfortable with lovely soft linen.  All the staff were most helpful and courteous and professional.  We would choose this hotel again.,
9,Excellent boutique hotel in New York,Fabulous service| comfort| location and all around great boutique hotel in Manhattan. Enjoyed the happy hour very much and the 24 hour cookies didn't hurt either!!!. Having a choice of newspapers was a nice touch too.,
1,Little Gem,Never have I felt so comfortable in a big city.   This little boutique hotel is loaded with amenities that will impress:    quality service| continental breakfast| wine and cheese at cocktail hour and a lovely lobby to use as a resting point.   The rooms are well-suited to a long stay| including the best bathroom lighting I've ever seen in a hotel.   You wont be disappointed.,
1,Turning 40 in New York,Turning 40 in New York was just perfect by staying at Hotel Giraffe with its good location and its staff so nice| always smiling and helpful. We enjoyed the good breakfeast and the marvelous wine and cheese! We just loved this place!,
4,One of the best,I've travelled the world & Hotel Giraffe is one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in. The staff are wonderful -the most helpful I've ever come across with the nicest attitude. The room was great - bed - fabulously comfortable & free breakfast & cheese & wine every day -the icing on the cake.,
18,Awesome!,Stayed with my daughter in April for Spring break.  We felt very well looked after.  The room was beautiful| spacious and clean.  The front desk staff were professional and very helpful.  The breakfast and snacks were fantastic. We will be back!  ,
258,Boutique Luxury with Heart and Soul,Now this was an unexpected surprise.  What a GREAT boutique hotel.  For starters the staff is awesome.  Friendly| accomodating| and always one step ahead of you which is great.  The lobby is small but cozy with a grand piano in the center ot it.  From 4 to 8PM there's a hosted complimentary cheese and wine bar plus yummy snacks throughout the day.  The rooms are stylish| super clean and laid out nicely.  Had a problem with the TV remote but that's not the hotels fault.  There's two elevators| and even when it's busy| they're still pretty speedy.  There's an outdoor patio on the top floor that gets plenty of sunshine and comfortable seating.  The building is only 12 stories tall| so if you're looking for a stunning view| it's not there.  But if you're looking for luxury without…,
1,Lovely boutique hotel,Very comfortable| small hotel with good sized rooms and bathrooms.  All more than adequately furnished. The breakfast which was included in the price was perfect and the cheese and wine offered in the evening was very welcoming after a long day in the city.  The staff were very hospitable and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again in future.,
84,Lovely hotel,I would come back here.  The rooftop terrace and complimentary breakfast are great.  Free wifi.  Guys at the desk were wonderful and super friendly.  We checked in at 8pm on a Thursday.  We had a balcony room and really liked that too.,
4,Gorgeous Giraffe!,I truly cannot say enough positive things about the fabulous experience my mother and I had here in late April this year! The attention to detail| cheerful demeanour of all members of staff whenever approached for restaurant advice or any other information or help| the cleanliness of the hotel| and the willingness of all staff to 'pitch' in wherever necessary I have never encountered before anywhere in the world.  Sadly I didn't catch everyone's names so please forgive me for the ones that I've forgotten or didn't take note of but a big thank you to JR| Chris and David on the front desk and Laura on the wine reception! You were truly exceptional!   Next time in I/we are in New York  there is only one place to stay and that is the Giraffe!,
2,Love the Giraffe!,Staff all great from booking questions| to check in and to check out. Helpful restaurant recommendations.  Love the wine and snacks for 3 hours at night and good breakfast. Very nice bathroom and room size very good for Manhattan,
4,great experience,I love the service - the location is OK....the beds are fine...but there is something about the place that make it great.  the wine hour is nice. the fron t desk always goes out of its way to do the right thing.   ask for a room with a little balcony,
92,pricet but lots to recommend,26th and Park Avenue South.  Nice wine/cheese in airy lobby; cold but varied buffet breakfast buffet that can be delivered at no extra charge.  Pricey rooms| but well appointed.  Lighting a bit dim for reading; bed nice and firm.  Friendly staff all around.  Stay on the 26th street side to minimize (not eliminate) traffic noise -- also lovely French doors onto tiny balcony.  2 blocks to #6 subway| 1 block to Murray Hill South Asian neighborhood (Lexington).  Attached bar/restaurant on lower level.  Very enjoyable and great location.  Rooms small for the expense.,
1,a great NYC experience,We loved the room| the great breakfast|happy hour every night| snacks at all times and very friendly and helpful staff. We also loved dining at the restaurant Bread and Tulips. We will return. We loved having diffent newspapers to read daily. The car service to the airport was super..      ,
5,Marvelous Home Away From Home!,My daughter and I just returned from 10 nights at the Hotel Giraffe and we could not be happier with our choice.  Our reservations were handled thru Ashley and she made sure everything was perfect.  The staff at the hotel were pleasant| polite and engaging and always met our needs.  The king balcony suite was awesome.  It was on the 5th floor and faced Park Avenue and yes| the city noise was present but that's part of the experience of visiting New York.  No noise what so ever came from inside the hotel| we slept like babies.  We started every day with the morning offerings and found everything to be fresh and tasty.  The ladies in the morning were wonderful.  And always nice to come back to the wind and cheese hour as a prelude to our evening activities.  The neighborhood is…,
71,Very pleasant indeed!,"Excellent location. Good value for money. Very friendly assistants. Immediate service.  Poor on picking us up at airport. Limousine was late and refused to fetch us inside airport. We had to go out and find him. Very poor help in recommending restaurants in the area. Ended up going to over 6 restaurants... each one with a waiting time of 30 to 60"". Very noisy location and hard to sleep. But we guess that is NY...",
38,Great location| nice amenities| friendly staff,My wife and I were recently in NY for 2 days of business and 2 days of leisure.  We picked the hotel mainly because the location was convenient for my wife's work| and we were pleasantly surprised.  The rooms are relatively spacious by Manhattan standards; we had no trouble leaving both of our suitcases open on the floor while we were there.  For me| the best feature is the lobby area.  There is always complimentary coffee| tea and some light snacks available to enjoy while coming or going of if you're meeting friends before dinner.  In the evening| there's wine and cheese available as well.    The location is also great.  It avoids the chaos of Midtown/Times Sqaure| and there are lots of good restaurants nearby.  It's two blocks from the 6 train and three blocks from Madison…,
4,Great hotel| very convenient location,The Hotel Giraffe is a great place to stay at if you want to visit New York in the best possible conditions. The location is super convenient (2 metro stops within 3 blocks)| and so we waled a lot! What we really loved about it is that it is a small hotel hotel for NY. Boutique hotel are really perfect for a quiet stay when you visit New York and you want to come back to your hotel and just relax (wine and cheese at night were really appreciated). We had a suite overlooking E 26th| so rather quiet at night (for NY at least!). The sitting room was not really big| but way enough for us. Rooms were very clean| the beds very very comfortable. The staff is really nice and helpful| from the booking to the time we left. I already recommend this hotel to anyone I know visiting New York!…,
33,We're home,We stayed in this 4 star boutique hotel for 10 nights and couldn't be happier.  Travelled with our teenage daughter so the suite on the 12th floor was perfect. Room was quiet| clean and tidy.  Beds comfy. Linen| white fluffy towels and toiletries were of high quality. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were friendly but professional.  Organised airport transfer for us to and from hotel. Perfect location close to subway and restaurants.  The breakfast was fresh and plentiful. Evening cheese and wine a perfect touch. Having travelled a lot I highly recommend these boutique hotels that continue to get it right.  No waiting for lifts no hustle and bustle in big foyers| check in| check out quick and efficient and always very attentive.  We will return and stay at the…,
33,A gem of a hotel!,Stayed here for 3 nights in April and could not have wished for a better experience. From first booking our reservation to arriving the staff could not have been more helpful with advice on where to visit and arranging transport from the airport to the hotel. On arriving the help continued with restaurant suggestions and bookings. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful at all times. We stayed in a king size balcony room and although we didn't have much of a view| it was good to experience the hustle and bustle of New York life. The bed was huge and the room was ample big enough. The turn down service every was a nice touch along with the bathrobes and slippers. The cheese and wine reception every evening was most welcome after a full day sightseeing and shopping. Hot…,
136,Excellent!!,The Hotel Giraffe was our first stop on a 3 week whirlwind trip across the USA and the best of the 6 places we subsequently stayed in. Beautiful hotel|we had a balcony room which was perfect. The breakfast|cheese and wine in the evening were all great. Position for us was ideal|we are walkers| and never once used the subway!! Times Square one way|Union Square the other! The staff were perfect but the lady who served the wines& cheese was exceptional(never got her name|unfortunately) Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.,
110,Fab location and hotel,What a wonderful find - it was our first trip to NYC and what a great impression the staff made - polite| helpful and attentive| but not overly pushy or in your face| which we liked..  All the staff were friendly and helpful - booked restaurants and helped us with the subway and gave great advice.  The breakfast and wine and cheese are a great way to start and end hectic days and the rooms are spacious| clean and comfortable| what more could you ask for.  You thoroughly deserve your Tripadvisor rating - and we will definitely be back to enjoy the hotel again - we are NYC converts.,
16,Great hotel!,I love this hotel!  The rooms are always clean & comfortable.  The complimentary breakfast is very enjoyable| as is the evening reception.  They staff is very courteous and helpful.  One of my favorite hotels un NYC!,
1,A little attention....,My wife and I came to NY from San Francisco to celebrate our anniversary. The facilities were very nice| but the staff was less than enthusiastic... Although they knew we were visiting from out of town and we were a bit tired upon check-in| not a word about the neighborhood or where we might get dinner in the area. No mention of the restaurant in the hotel. During our entire stay| with a staff of at least 2-3 people at the front desk| not once did any staff member ask if they could be of assistance in finding or suggesting something interesting to do or see in The City. No proactive interest at all. Everyone was polite| but uninterested. We don't expect tour guides| but showing a little interest in your visiting guests goes along way. On our last trip in 2007| we stayed at the…,
65,Giraffe - Great Place!,I recently spent one night at the Hotel Giraffe on very short notice. I chose it due to the location (and because of the funky name)| and left the next day a huge fan.  Making the online reservation the day of arrival worked incredibly well (not always the case| since some reservation systems block you| or make it impossible to process online)| the correspondence with the front desk was friendly and incredibly helpful| and check-in upon arrival easy and uncomplicated. My room was spotless| comfortable| and the bathrobe so incredibly comfortable that I ended up purchasing one for my mother.  Breakfast in the lobby is all you need| the staff available at all times for special requests| and the value for money great (all the more considering you are in New York). I will definitely…,
2,Giraffe is great,Our daughter is a big fan of giraffes so once we'd found this hotel when looking for somewhere to stay in New York then there was probably no other alternative. Hotel Giraffe lived up to our expectations though and our daughter was excited & delighted. From the decor to the facilities to the giraffe statue on the roof terrace everything was a hit. The beds are comfy| wi-fi is fast| breakfast and other refreshments through-out the day delicious. And if you want something to eat when you've arrived late into town and don't want to start exploring then Bread & Tulips is excellent too.,
1,Friendly in nature,"This was the second time we stayed at the Giraffe. We returned because what I felt the first time was that this was a hotel with personel that were honest and helpful| rightly proud of the work they did| and simply service minded and in a friendly way always wanted to make sure the guest was happy.  Our feelings are exactly the same after this second time. We arrived jet lagged and tired| and I was grumpy and disappointed that we didn't get a high floor as requested. The personel at the desk were very friendly| (despite my awful mood)| and reassured me they would try to do a change. Next day they called me on my phone when we were out| and asked for permission to do a ""room-move""| and when we got back later that day we had a higher floor and my son was happy. (I also apologized…",
3,A little treasure!,We stayed for 3 nights in April 2014 - 2 adults 2 children. The room was spotless| big enough (you shouldn't be spending too long in your room in NYC!!).  Great location for exploring both uptown and downtown| and a quieter area so it's good to get away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square etc.  The evening wine and cheese reception is great and the kids loved the cookies and tea/hot chocolate offered throughout the day. The breakfast was good too and if it's busy just ask for a table and they will set one up for you. A good selection of restaurants also situated close by. If we come to New York again we won't be staying anywhere else but Hotel Giraffe.  You deserve your rating on Trip Advisor xx,
5,Hidden gem in NYC, consistently  friendly and Superb service and attention.Excellent location for exploring  mid and  lower Manhattan. The morning buffet and evening wine and cheese are great extras that make for a great and relaxing way to enjoy your stay in NY        ,
3,New York break,Great hotel with most helpful & welcoming staff.Very comfortable &quiet(by New York standards!) bedrooms. Breakfasts are good & afternoon wine & canapés most enjoyable. Hotel is well placed for metro mid & downtown.a large number of varied eating houses close by|would recommend a visit to Eataly the other side of Madison Square on 5th Avenue.,
16,Exceptional Service,We stayed here with my husband and 7-year old daughter last June. We had a fantastic stay and we really loved this hotel. The 'cheese and wine' happy hour was fantastic and a great touch; the breakfasts were amazing too. The hotel has a really warm feel about it - the staff are excellent. Our room (a suite with balcony) was perfect for us and much larger than usual hotel rooms in NYC. I'm looking forward to trying out their sister hotel| The Library. Thank you Giraffe for a wonderful visit.,
40,I heart Giraffe,Please don't look at the Giraffe because then I can't have it all to myself! Excellent location| beyond-gracious staff| comfortable and oversized-by-NY-standards rooms = high value given all of those assets. We love staying here and chose it for a couple of anniversary trips| our 14th the most recent on the last weekend of March. Gramercy neighborhood is super| great restaurants all around and right on subway.,
2,8,Excellent!,The only negative about the hotel is I had just one night to stay here this time!  I've been to NYC many times and this is by far the best hotel that I've stayed at there.  It was clean| the staff were all super nice and helpful and it's in a great location| on Park and 26th.  It's pretty close to at least a couple of subways.  They had complimentary fruit| muffins| cookies| water| and coffee in the afternoon.  I wasn't there in the early evening| but I believe they have complimentary cheese in the late afternoon.  I also checked out before breakfast| but I believe it too is complimentary.  The room was extremely large| especially for NYC standards and the amenities in the room were nice.  Can't wait to return!
1,Wonderful romantic weekend,My husband and I had a delightful weekend at Hotel Giraffe. The staff was consistently helpful and gracious| offering assistance with things like filling our ice bucket or hailing a taxi| and pointing out the many wonderful features of the hotel like the complimentary wine and cheese hour and the discount at the affiliated restaurant| Bread & Tulips (which was delicious!). We also hosted a gathering of 20 friends in the bar at Bread & Tulips| and we were able to reserve the lounge area without paying any additional fees. Our room was beautiful and even had a small balcony. Thank you!,
193,Nice stay,I stayed with my wife at this hotel| which is well located| close to subway station. The staff is well trained and helpful. The breakfast is well served. The room and facilities are clean and comfortable. I would stay there again.,
40,Great hotel,The Giraffe has become my standard hotel in New York. Functionally located on the 6 train line (that serves most the places I visit). Deeply friendly. Comfortable. Clean. Doesn't nickel-and-dime you with extra charges.  I have now spent about 30 nights there - and I have plenty of other options. Its almost home.   --  As a regular guests there are only two minuses. The area of New York is not the most fascinating and the elevators are slow - often very slow. But these are quibbles about a great establishment.,
44,Great hotel. Attentive Service. Good location.,Stayed here on business March 27-29| 2014. The hotel staff has excellent and very attentive customer service. They anticipate or assist with every need. You don't experience service like that  often. Great rooms with everything you need| nice chocolates at turn down service and great amenitites through the day (breakfast| coffee/snacks| wine/cheese reception)| etc. Location is great too. Near everything| but tucked away on a quieter street.,
1,The best hotel,A perfect hotel! We went with our 3|5 yr old son and we all loved it. Perfect service. Relaxed surroundings. Perfect location. I really recommend it to everyone. We will come back next time we're in NYC.,
14,Lovely Hotel,Just stayed at the Giraffee for our anniversary and can highly recommend it.  The staff is very accommodating and friendly.  The room is perfectly appointed couldn't ask for anything more.  We particularly liked the location on 26th street as you can get downtown or uptown easily from that location.  We didn't participate in the wine and cheese but we did enjoy the bagels in the morning.  We were very comfortable during our 2 night stay as this hotel and will plan to stay here again.,
58,Totally Amazing,First to the owner| what ever you pay these guys is not enough!| where does one start?| from house keeping to doormen| via reception and wine staff| THANK YOU| nothing could have made our stay any better| totally superb stay / experience| great location| at breakfast there is all you need| coffee all day| wine in the evening| piano| spotless rooms| and staff who genuinely smile and converse with you| Mike Gabriella and Jose and the rest of the staff| THANK YOU! ,
39,Great all-round hotel,I love staying at the Giraffe. It's a great hotel for doing business in New York| especially for women. It's comfortable with just enough personality| rooms are warm| spacious and quiet| with great bathrooms| good to return to after a long day of meetings or exploring New York. I also like that breakfast is included| and wi-fi is free. The staff are generally very friendly and helpful. The location is also very handy for the subway.,
16,A great stay in NYC,Hotel Giraffee| located 26th Str Park Av South. A very nice design hotel. We stayed 2 adults and 2 adult children in one room for 5 days. Excellent service| breakfast included| and just not a lousy continental one. At 5 pm complimentary wine and cheese is served| just perfect after a hard day in Manhattan. Recommended!,
10,Good option,Had 2 night stay with my teenage son|in King suite. Living room was dark as it faced wall but that suited us| it was quiet!  Modern|clean room|comfortable bed & bedding| turn down service. Roof terrace is nice. Good location| safe| easy to walk anywhere.  Took us less than 30 mins to walk to Times square.  Staff are friendly but not in your face.  Free bagels| pastries| fruit & cereal breakfast & cheese/crackers/wine in evening is a bonus in NYC.  I am taking one star off because the lobby gathering area/breakfast area was rather impersonal & drafty as main doors opening/closing caused cold breeze & is not as cozy/private as their sister hotel 'library gathering room' on upper floor . If you want your coffee or breakfast in room you can request it| there's a list of extras &…,
59,Great boutique hotel,This was my second time staying at the Giraffe Hotel. I chose it primarily for its location| but also for the excellent service and amenities it offers. The hotel presents a terrific wine and cheese spread for a few hours later in the day and a great complimentary continental breakfast each morning. Whole fruit and cookies and muffins are available in the lobby throughout the day. The first time I stayed here| I was with my sister and aunt and we had one of the suites with a balcony. The size was perfect for the 3 of us and we did not feel too confined at all. When I returned on this trip with my husband| I thought I was booking the same room| but was disappointed to find out we were on the end of the hall and the room did not have a balcony. Although I was told the size of the…,
1,Love the hotel!,Nice| silent| big room. Enjoyed the nice lobby/café with complementary coffee (excellent coffemachine) and  the wine and cheese receptions in the afternoons. Friendly staff and great service. Loved my stay here!,
7,Amazing Hotel,We make many trips to NYC from Long Island to visit our daughter.  Our stay at the Giraffe was incredible.  The most important aspect was the friendly| helpful staff.  they could not have been nicer.  They helped us with our restaurant selection and had a great sense of humor.  The lobby was fun and classy.  We had the king suite which was as nice as any suite we have been in anywhere in NYC.  You cannot go wrong by staying at the Giraffe.  Our new home away from home.,
10,Will be my NYC home away from home!,I stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for a mommy/daughter weekend in October 2013.   I am not sure where to begin.  I visit NYC once or twice a year and I have never had a better experience than at the Giraffe.  The lobby wine reception is generous| classy and more than welcome benefit after a day of travel or exploring the city. The breakfast is something the adults enjoyed and our girls were over the moon!   The rooms are above and beyond in EVERY way!  They are spacious| luxurious and the balconies added a fun treat so that the girls could see the taxis go by :-).   The bathrooms are gorgeous and the service was absolutely 5 star and we cannot WAIT to go back.,
23,great hotel in middle of New York,"Loved the location. Loved the cheese and wine in the evenings and staff very helpful. Walking distance from Empire State Building and ""The Rock"". Broadway not too far away as is the Flat iron district. Would recommend bus to us as well as the Greenwich Village food tour.",
4,Great NYC Boutique Hotel,Great boutique hotel near midtown| but far enough away to skip the crazy tourist crowds. Charming decor and atmosphere| welcoming and attentive staff. Great price includes morning breakfast bar and wine & cheese with live piano music in the evenings.,
9,Excellent hotel - perfect for a weekend,This was my 2nd stay at Hotel Giraffe and everything about the experience was excellent.  The staff were attentive and professional| and went out of their way to make sure that our stay was perfect in everyday.    The hotel is centrally located in Manhattan so is close to most attractions.  The buffet breakfast and complimentary cheese & wine in the evenings were a really nice touch that made the hotel feel more relaxed and a home from home.    Highly recommended and I would definitely stay here again!,
1,Cozy| Comfortable and Convenient,The warm atmosphere emanates from candles in the lobby to the music playing in your room at turn down time. The location is away from midtown but cabs on Park Ave are frequent and access to the subway at 23rd and 28th streets makes public transit to almost anywhere in the city simple. The 23rd Street bus will take you straight to the High Line. The lower level restaurant will not disappoint. They take very good care of you without it feeling over the top.,
5,Fantastic Find in Great Location!,Great value and terrific| big rooms near Flatiron and ESB.  Loved having a balcony and enjoyed all the complimentary offerings.  Service was great and the hotel was super clean and roomy.  Loved our stay and can't wait to go back!,
18,Boutique gem in great location,I met a friend for a girl's weeklong trip to NYC.  We had a wonderful experience at the hotel.  The service was excellent.  The staff were very friendly and helpful with making reservations and suggestions.  The location is also central so it's easy to get to many different parts of the city.  I've stayed at many different hotels in the city over the years.  While this may not be the fanciest hotel| I had one of my more pleasant stays.  The size of the hotel makes it more enjoyable.  The wine| cheese and free breakfast in the lobby were all very nice extras.,
1,a home away from home in New York,In all my travels I have never come across a warmer| friendlier| attentive hotel than Giraffe. 24/7 coffee cheese snacks and drinks free and a chocolate on my pillow!! And it's all done in a comfortable environment!,
147,Terrific Hotel in Manhattan,The Hotel Giraffe was a splurge for us| but well worth it!  The staff was great| especially JR & Chris at the front desk who patiently helped me review how to get where| made arrangements for me and looked up a laundry.  The ladies at the morning breakfast took such great care of us| preparing a beautiful tray when we ate upstairs one day.  Loved the wine and cheese in the evening!  We had a 2 bed balcony suite and enjoyed being able to look out at all the activity. Nightly turndown service was great - it was a pleasure to come back to a room that was lit softly with music playing.  Location was great for all of our adventures - within a few blocks of two different subway lines.  Make sure to ask the front desk for the NYC Concierge map and you will easily be able to find your…,
108,A head above the rest. (See what I did there? Giraffe?),Okay| here is an honest review: I lived in New York for a decade| and I have traveled to New York for at least one week per year for the last eleven years. I have stayed at more than a few hotels. The Giraffe has the biggest sink area| the strongest water pressure and some of the nicest staff I have ever experienced. It felt like home away from home. It is efficient and clean. The towels are thick. And the service is attentive.  We stayed in Room 706| a King Suite| with our 9 and 14-y-o kids| and it was exceptionally comfortable. The other reviews are correct. Book now.,
1,Excellent Service,The hotel staff are great| service was excellent.  They where very helpful with questions and any extra arrangements that we requested including tickets to shows| and car service from and to the airport.  Rooms are clean| bed was comfortable| all the little things are included in the room| and a couple of extra's such as comp. water bottles each day| wine and cheese in lobby everyday| a good selection for breakfast| and a full coffee bar in lobby. The hotel is located a bit south of Time Square| but if you mind walking a bit| it is an excellent choice.   The only draw back was the restaurant located in the hotel.  It is not actually part of the hotel| but you can access it from the hotel elevator.  The food is okay| not great| service is okay| but not great.  You receive a 20%…,
1,Perfect NY Hotel,I cannot say enough positive things about Hotel Giraffe. The hotel itself was small and beautiful. The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. The complimentary breakfast and wine/cheese reception was incredibly convenient and also delicious. The price was also unbeatable for NYC. I will definitely be returning to Hotel Giraffe in the future!,
12,Simply outstanding,My wife and I stayed two nights in a king suite and could not have been happier with the choice.  Room was nicely laid out and everything was top quality.  An example: the door to the bathroom was solid wood with a large panel of privacy glass.  The included continental breakfast was a great option as was the afternoon wine and cheese.  The staff was professional| friendly and obviously into taking care of guests.  The location was ideal for our weekend plans.  I would definitely stay again and recommend it to friends.,
4,Really nice place to stay,Lovely hotel| extremely friendly staff.  The location is very convenient for people planning to visit Broadway shows| as the hotel is just a couple of blocks away from Madison Square Park and the yellow NQR line| which you pick up in Times Square.  Bread and Tulips has excellent food in a casual setting.  The breakfast options each morning are just what you need -- cereals| pastries| oatmeal| fruit -- and the late afternoon wine bar is a great way to relax after a long day.,
15,Elegant Oasis with great staff,We enjoyed our stay very much and found the following aspects of the hotel to be exceptional; staff| cleanliness| comfort| location| breakfast and wine reception. The young men working at the front desk were so helpful and friendly. Gabriella| at the wine and cheese reception| was so pleasant and kind. We stayed in a suite with two adults and our kids; 10 & 14.  We set a comfortable temperature on the thermostat and kept the fan running which blocked out any street noise during the night. All the best.,
4,Great Stay| Friendly Staff| Not super touristy location! 3.7.14,I like to travel. And when I travel I like to experience neighborhoods and not necessarily tourist traps. The location of hotel giraffe is perfect for that. In the flat iron district close to a few parks| still walking to flat iron and empire state building| but also cool to walk to SoHo shopping and other cool neighborhoods.  Staff is super nice| they call cabs| give good directions| very polite and helpful! And best of all-complimentary wine and cheese at 5pm-so nice to relax to as well as save money on snacks and breakfast. Complimentary breakfast (with lots of choices and actually tasty foods and healthy stuff-not just danishes etc) and wifi (with no access probs) Rooms are spacious (we had a room with two double beds) and they are updated with good lighting (I had dark…,
10,excellent as ever,I am a repeat visitor to library collection many times to Giraffe and Casablanca. Unless you experience this Hotel group you don't know what you are missing! They have got it all right! Choose your location in NYC then choose your Library Hotel and everything will be Perfect! ,
32,Perfect Small Hotel,Can't say enough about this hotel! Perfect location in the Flatiron District- can walk to everything from Times Square to SoHo. It's the little things that make the hotel great: fabulous staff| rooms with Memory Foam pillows| excellent light breakfast| wine and cheese in the evening. All for a reasonable price by New York standards. Definitely my go to hotel in the future! ,
43,The reviews are right!!,Booked this hotel for out first visit to nyc based on the TA reviews. They weren't wrong!   Arrived at 2pm| checked in quickly and found complementary wine in the room.   Free continental breakfast is plentiful and staff are more than willing to get you more coffee/toast.   We were never at the hotel for the free wine and cheese between 5 and 7pm but we heard it was a lovely way to finish off a hard days sightseeing.   24/7 coffee facilities in reception are useful when you come in and are freezing!   Reception staff very knowledgable about restaurants to eat at in different neighbourhoods| recommended a particularly good one near Central Park.  Central location within easy waking distance of most of the sights. Would never stay anywhere else if we visited again!,
1,A Gem in New York,"I discovered this boutique hotel last November visiting my son in New York.  I am so impressed with their friendliness and the ""extras"" they provide like free breakfast| free wine and cheese hour. It is my favorite hotel in New York.",
4,One word: Excellent!,Myself and my fiancé stayed at Hotel Giraffe at the beginning of January 2014. We were impressed with the service of all staff throughout| and the room was very impressive. Complimentary breakfast and evening wine and cheese made the price great value for money and the central location meant that we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go.  The hotel restaurant (Bread & Tulips) was probably the best quality and best value food we ate throughout our stay| eating there twice in the 10 day stay - the waitress even remembered us on our second visit.  The general noise of the city was the only thing which affected our sleep and would have been the same anywhere we had stayed| the hotel offers a lot of ways to combat the noise such as ear plugs and a SleepPhones system which you…,
48,Delightfully simple,"Most hotels in NYC tend to be either very large| impersonal or extremely ""trendy/hipster"". I wanted something a bit more personal and a room with a balcony. I booked this hotel based on their tripadvisor ratings and was not disappointed. Yes| you do pay a premium for being in NYC and in a good location| but I think the pricing is adequate for what the hotel has to offer. The staff is delightful| rooms are simple but clean and charming| breakfast is good and the hotel has a lovely laid-back atmosphere| possibly because it tends to attract a very unassuming crowd: a nice mix of business travellers and tourists looking for somewhere quiet to stay| with no gimmicks. If I had to make a single recommendation to the hotel it would be to possibly consider adding tea/coffee making…",
6,Hotel Giraffe,Great hotel-we stay there last weekend. (2/21/2014) Big room | excellent service and very good continental breakfast. We loved wine and cheese hrs (specially piano accompaniment) We used to stay at Library hotel (sister to Giraffe) but  now we changing our priority) it will be Giraffe and then if there is no room we will go to Library.,
2,489,Quiet| Friendly| Clean and Perfect,A quick stay in Manhattan; looking for something a little bit different than the usual 'big box' brand property. Took a chance on something new (looking at high TripAdvisor scores) and selected Hotel Giraffe. Location is just a few blocks south of the main midtown CBD. This creates an incredibly quiet scene. Hardly think you are on a main street! The building is small| with just a few rooms per floor. We had a corner facing Park Avenue| and still no noise! The staff are attentive| and very knowledgeable. It is clear they enjoy their environment| nothing feels fake! The guest room was furnished comfortably| very understated. Clean bathrooms. Turndown service. There is a complementary breakfast on the main floor| and while we did not use it| I am told that there is complementary…
1,Wonderful Stay!,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel Giraffe! From beginning to end| we were extremely impressed with our room| hotel  amenities and level of service. The neighborhood was also great! All of the staff were so friendly and helpful. Whether it was check-in| providing general info| or waiting on us during the complementary wine and cheese reception or breakfast| they were always pleasant and attentive. We stayed in a king suite and had plenty of room for 3 adults to spread out| relax and maintain privacy when we needed it. The only negative was the fact that we had to cancel one of our planned night's stay due to the unending snow days cutting my school vacation short (I'm a teacher). I would stay here again in a heartbeat!,
3,Lovely Boutique Hotel,If you are looking for a clean| comfortable| quiet| friendly| upscale| reasonably priced hotel to stay in the city then this is the place. There is free wine and cheese every evening and free continental breakfast every morning in the lobby| as well as a 24 hour self service cappuccino machine. The rooms are cozy and relaxing. We enjoyed watching the snow from our balcony over Park Avenue. The hotel is convenient to public transportation and not that difficult to park if you bring your own car. We have stayed there twice already and will gladly return the next time we want to get away,
44,Perfect for familiy of four,Perfect NY Hotel for a family of four people in one room| as most other places usually only accept 3 people. Very friendly staff. Complementary breakfast and afternoon wine & cheese are wonderful! Both can become full meals. I would not hesitate to come back to The Giraffe again and again.,
3,Excellent stay!,The location is perfect for grabbing a cab or the subway to go uptown or downtown. They have a great free breakfast every morning and wine and cheese each evening. The service was excellent; everyone was friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. I highly recommend Hotel Giraffe.       ,
1,Low key luxury,I found the hotel to be upscale without being pretentious.  The staff was friendly.  Everything is very clean and modern and comfortable. The wine in the afternoon was wonderful and the coffee in the morning was great.,
1,The Giraffe Says...,Great location a block from the flatiron building| and the awesome food hall Eataly. Within striking distance of the theater district| central park| the Brooklyn bridge| and the 911 memorial. The only way they came up short was that there are only 7 floors- not very tall for a Giraffe. But the smaller size is an asset- customer service is excellent.,
22,A lovely hotel,We stayed for 4 nights over New Years Eve. A good| little hotel with only about 75 rooms and a new feeling to it. Free wifi both in room and lobby. Good size rooms with all the amenities you need| hairdryer| bathrobe and slippers. At first we were a little bummed that there was no tray with coffee/ tee and kettle but that is available in the lobby all day so no problem. Bed was big and nice with ample amount of pillows. Although our room had a small balcony and a view of Park Avenue there was very little noice from the street. (maybe because of the holidays). Breakfast was very good with a good selection of bagels and pastries| cream cheese| fresh fruit salad| oat meal| cereals| orange and other juices and coffee and tea and news papers. The complimentary cheese and wine in the…,
6,Never been more impressed,I've never been more impressed by a hotel stay than I was at this hotel with the funny name.  The room was well appointed| the bed was very comfortable and the noise level was low (for NYC).  The staff could not have been more helpful| but they were also unobtrusive.  The Continental breakfast in the lobby was first rate and probably would've cost me dozens of dollars elsewhere on its own (again| a NYC thing).  This place is a gem.,
11,Pitch Perfect!,This stay exceeded my expectations on every level. I needed to be in the area for business and chose the hotel for proximity| I will return next time in order to have a wonderful experience. The staff could not have been more attentive nor the accommodations more pleasing.,
28,Excellent,Stayed here for one night when we went out with friends in the city. The hotel staff were fantastic and the complimentary wine and cheese night was a very welcome surprise. The room was amazing! A huge bed and even a lounge. We didn't think we would get to use this but the 1pm check-out ensured we could. The late check-out was one of the best features. Also| the roof terrace looked like it would be a very cool place to enjoy a refreshing drink in the summer. It was freezing when we were there so we couldn't really enjoy this. In summary| if you want a comfortable| clean and well appointed hotel you can't go wrong with hotel giraffe. Definitely 5 stars!,
51,outstanding hotel from service to room-an oasis in busy NYC!,We stayed at the hotel giraffe for 4 nights over Super Bowl weekend.   This hotel was great!!  We had a king suite which was perfect.  Had separate rooms between bedroom and living room.   Small but nicely decorated.   The continental breakfast was delicious and there was wine and cheese in the afternoon-which was very good.  also| any time of day-if you popped in the hotel there were cookies and coffee/tea/hot chocolate.   The restaurant attached was also delicious.  The staff were always very pleasant and helpful.   The lobby was comfortable and inviting place to come into after touring around the bustling city.,
74,Diamond hotel and Staff,This hotel is fabulous from check in to check out. The staff are all very friendly and make you feel at home as soon as you enter . The hotel is spotlessly clean and beautiful . Jose greeted us and took our luggage he is lovely and very friendly . Reception staff are very friendly and will do anything for you to ensure your stay runs smoothly | they ordered our show tickets and tour tickets all from reception | they are always smiling and ready to help.  Breakfast is wonderful with a huge choice in lovely piano lounge which is so comfortable . Cheese and wine in the evenings is a joy | again very comfortable and homely . The room was huge | with a huge bed and a lovely bathroom all you need toiletries even fab slippers and snugly bathrobes. Nightly bed turn down service was a…,
49,Fantastic hotel!,This was our first visit to New York and we picked the best hotel!  It was fantastic - lovely clean rooms and very helpful staff.  The breakfast in the morning in the large lobby area was nice - plenty to choose from| and they happily cooked up the porridge for me too!  There was a coffee machine and tea available all the time too. The wine and nibbles in the evening was a great touch| especially after a long day sight seeing in the polar blast which had hit New York!,
17,Wonderful pleasant experience,"Lovely hotel with very pleasant people.  Nice room.  FREE Wi-Fi!  Complimentary breakfast and complimentary wine & cheese ""happy hour"" with finger foods and live piano in lobby.  So comfortable and in a good location.  Across from Manzanilla restaurant| which is very good as well.  I will definitely plan to stay here again.  I highly recommend it.",
28,Unique-  in a great way!,I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. It's not a typical NYC hotel. There was a balcony in our room| a lovely complimentary wine| cheese| olives| and nuts in the early evening| and complimentary breakfast ( eggs| toasted bagels| espresso| cappuccino| cereal| croissants| etc).  The staff were absolutely wonderful.  The location is in a very safe area within waking distance to nice shops and great restaurants.  We saw a concert at Irving Plaza and it was perfect for that.  Room was surprisingly big with a great bathroom.  Very clean- not a stray hair or spec of mold anywhere--  I'm very picky. Overall wonderful!!! ,
29,Exceeded High Expectations,Stayed here based on TA reviews| and it is all true!  Warm hospitality|  Example:  The doorman recognized me a block away and came out in the frigid cold to open the door and welcome me - upon arrival and more than once over several days.  I had booked the single queen room| which was immaculately clean and generously sized| included a balcony| and was cozy and surprisingly quiet.  Turn down service nightly| and many amenities offered at no extra charge.  Example: two bottles of water!  Then there is the food.  Best breakfast I have ever had at a hotel included in the room fee.  Fresh croissants of the highest quality with jam| pastries| bagels and cream cheese| cereals| fresh fruit| juices| espresso/cappucino/latte/coffee/tea; all beautifully presented and attended by friendly|…,
2,Just the place to stay in New York!,Lovely welcome.  Efficient service.  Clean and well-appointed rooms.  Superb location.  And we particularly appreciated the wine and cheese thing in the late afternoon.  Just the place to stay in New York| especially if you like characterful independent places which reflect their exciting environment.,
1,love the giraffe!,This was our second stay at the Hotel Giraffe and we had a fabulous time!  The staff is so helpful and friendly| our room was nicely appointed and comfortable and the wine hour and complimentary breakfasts were great!  Also| we love the location! We only stay at the giraffe when we to to NYC!  ,
10,It's not cool| but it's awesome,This place is just weird| but it's actually fantastic. The rooftop deck (with namesake giraffe statue) is a fantastic enclave above lower Manhattan. The nightly happy hour with free wine and cheese is delightful. And the suites are larger than most NY apartments. The beds are as hard as everyone says| and although they offer foam pads upon request| no one in my party actually received one.,
49,Wow! I give it a 10!,First time at the Giraffe but I plan on staying there whenever we come to NYC! An amazing place- gracious and professional staff! Immaculately kept hotel! We had a small suite on the second floor- spotless and very quiet!  Beautiful bathroom and all the amnenities ! great turndown service!  Kudos to housekeeping!! Two televisions- complimentary water- mini bar and a safe in the closet amazingly located at the proper height!!! Each morning there was a delicious complimentary breakfast complete with fruit| berries|  pastries| toast| bagels| cereal| juice and coffee with a lovely service staff. During the day there was coffe tea hot chocolate cookies and pastries available to enjoy.  Complimentary wine and cheese available late afternoon. We had dinner in the pretty Bread and…,
4,A perfect visit again,Me and our family have stayed in Giraffe several times before and it has become a natural choice for us. This time I was alone visiting my daughter in NYC. Giraffe has a perfect location| clean rooms and friendly staff. On top of that breakfast included| free coffee and bakery during the day and the wine and cheese reception are a nice bonus. Everything was just perfect and for our next visit hopefully in May we are sure to book Giraffe again. As I have said before New York is a great city and staying in Giraffe makes the visit even better!,
18,Oasis,I decided to surprise my husband to a weekend getaway for his 40th birthday| and after spending quite a bit of time researching hotels in NYC| I decided on Hotel Giraffe. And the result? PERFECTLY TERRIFIC!!!  I also (like many others before this review) cannot say enough about their level of customer service| graciousness of the staff|(they bend over backwards for you) good sized rooms for Nyc| (VERY CLEAN)...but felt warm and cozy LOVED the complimentary wine and cheese in the evenings(between 5-7) nice continental breakfast in the am(they'll even deliver it to your room for a small charge if you don't feel like getting up:) The rooftop patio Is oh so pretty| not necessarily somewhere you want to spend lots of time in the colder months| but very nice just the same.Our room was…,
80,Great service,My husband and I stayed here for two nights while in NYC for a weekend getaway.  It's really wonderfully located| and the staff was phenomenal.  We arrived late thanks to problems with our train| and as a result had to cancel our dinner reservations.  Upon check in| we were greeted warmly and it was suggested we have dinner at Bread and Tulips| located adjacent to the lobby of the hotel.  They even called to make sure they could accommodate us since it was later in the evening.  Our room was clean and well appointed.  I typically request rooms away from the elevator| and forgot to do so for this hotel stay and I was worried it would be noisy.  We had absolutely no problems with noise| including street noise (which I read other people experienced).  We enjoyed breakfast here both…,
2,always a good trip,We have been staying there for long weekends for 3 years now.  always clean| easy breakfast| nice wine & cheese before you go out at night.  right next to a small park| Eataly and SD26.   small| no crowds| just an all around great place.,
14,great stay,Fabulous stay| ideal location| friendly and helpful staff. We loved this hotel. We were 2 adults and 2 children sharing a quad room it was fantastic. We loved the informal breakfast| cosy and relaxed. The wine in the evening was a great time for the adults to catch up without the kids. Excellent stay all round will visit again,
50,Don't stay anywhere else| loved Hotel Giraffe,I cannot say enough about this hotel. We were forced to extend our stay in New York after being snowed in. We chose this hotel for our stay| it was fantastic. The staff were warm and welcoming and very accommodating. Check in was easy and the room was beautiful and large enough for our family of 4. The breakfast was perfect and the cheese and wine in the afternoon a delight to come back to in the afternoon/evening. The hotel is ideally situated with easy access to all the big attractions and great shopping| but far enough away from the hectic pace of New York. Loved it and would highly recommend to anyone. Thank you for a wonderful stay.,
39,what a gem,I was there for my sister's wedding. Staff could not have been more pleasant| although no doorman or assistance with my luggage on arrival. Had a suite with a comfortable bed and a refrigerator as requested. Food in the restaurant was delicious but service could have been better. The breakfast staff was efficient and the breakfast perfect. Music was pleasant and not too loud. Evening wine was appreciated and delicious. I will be back!,
7,Wonderful getaway (Shabbos friendly),We spent Friday night and Saturday night at Hotel Giraffe. The rooms| hotel and staff are wonderful. We informed the staff on Friday of the specific issues that Shabbos observers have when staying in a hotel i.e. electronic entry| room light| ice machine. The staff was on top of everything and they passed the information on to the other staff members. When I came back from Shul on Saturday| a staff member spotted me| and met me at my room to open the door - I didn't have to ask. They arranged for ice to be brought up at specific times and  for the lights to be turned off on Friday night. They also supplied us with 2 refrigerators at no extra charge. This is not a kosher hotel and you must bring your own meals for shabbos or eat out. When I called the hotel prior to our stay they…,
48,Brilliant hotel,My boyfriend and I booked at hotel giraffe when coming to New York City to celebrate our birthdays... On arrival we had a bottle if red and beautiful chocolates waiting for us to start our birthday celebrations| so this already added spark to the hotel. Throughout our stay the hotel cleanliness and service was brilliant. The breakfast was great| but more importantly we loved the wine/prosseco with the cheese and biscuits| olives etc in the early part of the evening that the hotel offered complimentarily! It was a beautiful hotel| and would highly reccommend. However| only downside which isn't really part of the hotel| however| the restuarant that is attached to the hotel that they offer 20% off isn't great at all and I wouldn't reccommend. It seems the 20% deal is great| until…,
27,Great getaway!,We spent two nights at Hotel Giraffe and it felt like a vacation. The small size makes it feel cosy| and the staff was so helpful with tips for getting around and finding places to eat. The room was much bigger than I expected in the city: roomy sitting area with couch| tv| chair and giant window| then nice bedroom and bathroom. Quiet and clean| and they surprised us with champagne for our anniversary! Breakfast and happy hour were also nicer than expected: delicious baked goods| fruit| and espresso machine in the morning and nice wine and cheese reception in the evening. we walked to the gym just a few blocks away and it met our needs. Lobby was cold| but it was the weekend of a major snowstorm. We loved Hotel Giraffe and can't wait to return!,
1,Loved This Place!,You are going to love this hotel for so many reasons. Chief among them is the welcoming| helpful| knowledge staff. Let them guide you to restaurants and services| rely on them you won't be disappointed.  The rooms were a nice size and so was the bathroom. Well appointed with your choice of pillows and mattress topper if you want.   We were very satisfied with the continental breakfast it was ample and kept us going till dinner.  Since we were visiting during the recent polar vortex we appreciated the hot chocolate and coffee after a day of being outside.  We could relax with a hot drink and read the New York Times or Wall St. Journal in their comfy nicely furnished lobby| it became our late afternoon living room.  We will definitely stay here again and would look forward to…,
1,Perfect New York Hotel,Stayed here for 7 nights over New Year and will definitely stay here again. From the staff to excellent breakfasts| 24 hour hot drinks & cookies| cheese & wine receptions and bedrooms| we could not fault this hotel. We stayed in the suite on the 12th floor and had no problems with noise. Our flight was delayed so we arrived a couple of hours later than expected and yet after taking only about 5 minutes to check in| a bottle of champagne which we had pre-ordered was waiting on ice in our room. On the morning of our departure we got a call in our room asking if we'd like reception to check if our flight was affected by the snow storm - a very nice touch. Location of hotel is excellent - we only took the subway once and taxis a few times as it was so nice to walk everywhere.,
1,Fabulous boutique hotel in the city - don't stay anywhere else!,I only have excellent things to say about my 2 recent stays at the Hotel Giraffe in December 2013 and January 2014.  The first stay was with 3 other girlfriends for 11 nights.  The hotel was fantastic and the staff catered to our every request.  Breakfast was served every morning in the lobby with an excellent array of fresh baked goods| cereals| fruit| yoghurt and boiled eggs.  Not to mention espresso coffee and tea.  The staff were only too happy to assist| including preparing oatmeal to your liking.  The wine and cheese reception from 5-8pm every evening was an absolute treat and a great way to start the evening.  While there is no gym onsite| Hotel Giraffe offers guests compliemtnary passes to the NYSC gym a short walk away – and if you ask me| that is a lot better than any…,
4,Wonderful stay at the Giraffe,The staff are the most gracious and helpful that we have run into at any time in a New York Hotel.  The wine and cheese hospitality time was most appreciated and in an intimate setting. Our room was clean with all the necessary amenities.  For our stay the location was perfect as our family lives just around the corner.  Dining and cab availability was accessible.                     ,
30,great location great hotel,would recommend and stay here again| the location was great| close to a lot of fabulous restaurants| walking distance to most sights and 2 mins to the metro. Only issue was the cost| as a week cost $4500.00,
3,All good,We stayed for four nights over new year. The all day hot drinks and cookies plus the wine and cheese work very well and the continental breakfasts are perfect. Rooms have all you need. Staff were all great. Would heartily recommend.,
14,Another excellent stay with one small complaint...,We stay here every January for my husband's birthday.  The staff is professional and the rooms are very comfortable. The only glitch in the service was that I ordered a bottle of Prosecco to be delivered to the room. I was expecting it to be there when we arrived or at least soon thereafter. Unfortunately| we did not receive it until after we had left for the night several hours later to see a show and have dinner.  By the time we got back to the room after midnight| we did not want it. We packed it up and took it home with us. Still| I would highly recommend this hotel and we plan to return next year.,
1,Giraffatastic,We had a great stay| even my wife| who is very| very fussy had no complaints - she even said that she enjoyed it! Superb location| breakfasted like lords of Bagel manor and drank wine in the evening like Bacchus. Room was stylish and good size| staff were friendly and knowledgeable. We had a great stay wi-fives all round       ,
34,Well located| comfortable lodging,We found the Hotel Giraffe to be great value and very well located to New York's subway system. This made traveling around much easier!  Hotel staff were attentive to our needs and nothing was to much for them. The room was a little small but then| we didn't come to a New York to stay there! All modern amenities were available and the 24 coffee and tea in the lobby was very welcome.,
4,Great wedding experience here,We chose the Hotel Giraffe based on the fact that it was part of the chain of hotels we've liked| but had not actually stayed there before booking a few rooms for family and friends| as well as the rooftop room for a small| informal wedding reception in between the wedding itself and a dinner out.   The staff was uniformly helpful. I wonder if it's because it's not a massively huge hotel? In any case| they were gracious with all kind of things--the fact that I checked 50x to make sure the room reservations for everyone were straight|  that I wanted to see the table layout for the event| and that we were traveling with a toddler and wanted a rented stroller and other equipment in the room when we arrived.  We were in a suite| and although it was a little weird to look into…,
178,Good location and service,Chose this hotel based on rating and availability. Flatiron district good choice as easy to get to any other part of Manhattan. We had the one bedroom suite which was a great size for New York. It's only weakness was road noise. Reception area packed morning and evening for free breakfast and wine reception. Nice space to meet other guests could have done with a bit more festive decoration.  Overall would recommend as a solid central location,
1,An oasis of calm in NYC,We cannot praise this hotel highly enough. The bedroom was more than adequate for our family of 2 adults and 2 grown up children| very spacious| comfortable and clean with all the amenities you would expect of a first class hotel. All the staff we encountered were friendly| courteous and could not do enough for us. The continental breakfasts were of the highest quality and more than enough to set you up for the day. The complimentary wine and cheese served in the evening in the comfortable lobby were a delightful end to a day sightseeing/shopping. We would definitely stay here again and would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone.,
287,Fantastic hotel to stay in New York !,We love the Giraffe ! We stayed there 6 nights in August 2013 with our kids aged 7 and 10. This followed a trip in Florida where we stayed in several hotels and the Giraffe was the last of our 3 weeks trip in the US… and it was far away the best hotel we had during all our trip in the US ! We particularly loved the perfect boutique hotel size| the design| comfort and amenities of the room| the location| the cleanliness| the nice lobby with the good cookies… all along the day| the cool but efficient staff| the rooftop bar| the wine and cheese hours| the adjacent Bread and Tulip restaurant and the fantastic location. We particularly liked to relax in the lobby with a glass of white wine after a full day of visit while Kids ate cookies and played. There is free WIFI all over the…,
145,Would stay again,Hotel Giraffe is a solid moderate hotel.  This hotel was an expensive option for us but when we arrived we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the accommodation and the inclusions. We had for two rooms at the end of the corridor that could be separated from the other rooms by an external door.    The rooms were a little darker and older than expected from the pictures on the website but still nice and a good size.  The master bedroom had a king bed| TV with wardrobes and draws for clothing.  It would have been better to have some more power points close to the bed.   There was a separate lounge area with a pull out sofa bed. There was still room to walk around with the bed left open.  The mattress was not the most comfortable so I asked for a pillow top mattress to be…,
1,Fabulous hotel,Hotel Giraffe is small but potent! The employees were extremely helpful and pleasant.--best customer service ever!   The location is great and rooms are very nice. We loved our stay here. Check out rooftop patio.               ,
12,Wow.... What a great place to stay in New York,We booked the Giraffe after reading reviews in TA.... What a fantastic boutique hotel! Warm and welcoming| intimate yet slick and professional. We had a 2 room suite for our family of 3.clean spacious| balcony| lots of extra touches and nothing too much trouble for the ever smiling staff. Complimentary Breakfast | the most amazing coffee machine which is free to use all day and night plus yummy home made cookies.... Cheese and wine also complimentary between 5&8pm whilst listening to the pianist..   We'll placed for both walking and hailing the yellow cab!! A great way to spend Christmas| we would definitely return. Fabulous .,
1,Amazing,I had never heard of the Hotel Giraffe until I received a gift certificate for a gift. Went with my mom and hubby this past Friday and I was amazed! It was so beautiful. Our room was so nice. They had a wine and cheese reception which was so nice. The entire staff were so friendly and helpful. Highly recommend it and will stay again. Thanks again for a wonderful visit!!,
3,Perfect,Great location with a balcony. The staff was fun and very friendly. The wine and cheese Hour was very relaxing and a great bonus to the stay. The room was big and the staff even brought us a complimentary bottle of wine to celebrate our honeymoon,
5,Family stay at the Hotel Giraffe- you won't be disappointed !,We pre booked a 5 night stay in a 2 bedroom suite. The staff are the most pleasant and helpful I have ever had the pleasure to deal with in any hotel. Nothing is too much trouble for them. Breakfast- amazing- loads of choice and fab coffee! Wine and cheese 5-8PM- WOW!! After a hard day shopping this was such a lovely treat to come back too. The hotel is very well situated and we managed to walk to everything with ease. The location is safe| near the subway and plenty of restaurants to visit. Overall- Lovely stay in a clean and comfortable hotel and if customer service is important to you- stay here!!!,
114,Christmas starts here,First time staying here and we will definitely stay again. Staff| rooms| location all made this an awesome holiday. The breakfast and evening drinks were so much more than we had expected! I cannot fault anything about staying at Hotel Giraffe. ,
1,Highly Recommended,Beautiful hotel| great location. The staff was friendly| professional| and helpful. We took full advantage of the morning breakfasts (fruit| yogurt| pastries and excellent coffee)' before spending the day  sightseeing. We returned in time for the evening wine and cheese before heading out for the evening.  The king suite was spacious and well appointed. Love this hotel! ,
9,Very Noisy,Have stayed here about 4 times. Great Location| friendly staff| very clean hotel| but very noisy due to heavy traffic area. Maybe there are rooms on the lower floors that are quieter. The Garbage trucks kept us up all night. It was a Sunday and maybe that is we hen the commercial garbage trucks pick up.,
25,Loved this hotel the staff are so helpful,This hotel is great you can walk to most things and the staff are really helpful they just made my stay even better. The breakfast had everything you want it was fab. When I go back to New York I will be staying there| thanks so much for looking after me on my big day xx ,
80,Small| comfortable| friendly!,This is a great boutique hotel in the Flatiron district. The rooms are not large | but they are very comfortable and well appointed. The free continental breakfast and afternoon wine and cheese spread make for great amenities that take the edge off the price which while not overly expensive was not cheap by NYC standards. From the doormen to the front end personnel expect nothing but the most courteous and friendly service. If there is any negative| it involves getting a cab in the evening...sometimes one cannot be found and that fact can be a little scary especially if you have theater tickets. All in all| however| we have stayed here many times and rate it as one of our favorites in the City!,
23,Pretty good,Very comfortable room and extremely nice staff. it is right beside the Armory on Park Avenue. I am a light sleeper and  unfortunately stayed there  just after a big fashion show. The noise of the dismantling of the show continued for the 6 nights I was there! Lorries clunking around all night. Found  the immediate vicinity is a bit boring.  You have to walk a few blocks to get to restaurants and shops,
163,Good Location - Helpful Staff - Comfortable Rooms,Located in mid town New York the Hotel Giraffe is on an ideal location on Park Avenue such that getting up or down town is easy. So much so that most of what the city has to offer is within walking distance. If not the the subway is just on the door step and taxis are abundant. The hotel staff are very helpful and friendly. The rooms are comfortable and well equipped. Cleanliness is very good.   There are hot drinks in reception 24 7 and the couple hours the hotel serves cheese and wine is really very pleasant - particularly as it comes after a long day in e city and just before a night out. Ideal.  To be recommended.,
1,December 2013,this was our third stay and it was very good.  We are very impressed with the staff and the consistency of the quality of service. We will be visiting NYC on a regular basis for business and plan on staying with you guys from now on.                ,
56,Excellent small hotel,Small hotel by NYC standards| and all the better for it. Location is excellent| close to Washington State Park and a block from the Metro. Walkable within 15-20 mins both to midtown and to Greenwich Village/SOHO| but in a quiet area. Several cafes and restaurants within a block. The hotel itself is great| very low key. Lobby is bright and the breakfast light and a nice change from cooked fare. The evening cheese and wine is a real bonus at the end of the day| and a lovely start to the evening. The room was excellent| very comfortable and spacious. Shower fairly poor| which is my only complaint about the hotel at all. It's not the cheapest| but will happily return next time in New York,
57,Very good hotel!,My girlfriends and I enjoyed our stay at Hotel Giraffe. The staff was incredibly helpful before we visited and was more than happy to give dinner recommendations and make reservations for us. They were wonderful! We only ran into one employee who was not very friendly when my pregnant friend asked for a mattress topper one evening when we arrived back to the hotel for the evening. He acted like he didn’t know what a mattress topper was (even though we had already discussed this with the concierge earlier) and was less than thrilled when we asked for one. Other than that| everyone was exceptionally helpful and friendly! The hotel is very cute and the complimentary wine and cheese was great. There were three girls on the trip so we booked the biggest room they offered. The room…,
30,Lovely in every way!,This hotel has ruined me for others!  The location was amazing| and the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  I love staying in smaller hotels because the staff is also smaller and tend to recognize you when you walk past the desk.    We had a corner suite| so we had a birds-eye view of both 26th and Park| beautiful window gazing while the snow was falling during our first evening!  The hotel was even kind enough to send up chocolate covered strawberries and wine because they knew that we were celebrating my bachelorette weekend.,
3,Fantastic Hotel can't wait to go back,Love this hotel| been there now 5 times and its always superb. Rooms are wonderfully fresh and clean. All the staff are wonderfully service minded at all times. Food is amazing| love the breakfast! I just love this place period!,
52,A Fabulous Stay,We stayed here from November 28th to December 2nd and I don't believe we could have made a better choice. After reading the reviews here and hearing from friends who experienced the Hotel Giraffe| it was an excellent choice. The staff were so friendly and helpful| our room was a great size and overlooked Park Avenue. A big enough space for three that we were not 'on top of each other'|comfortable bed and sofa bed and free wifi made our King suite perfect for our needs. The complimentary breakfast and evening wine and cheese were just what we needed to get us started first thing in the morning and enough to hold us over before dinner in the evening. A lovely| calm neighborhood to come back to after navigating harried crowds all day! I look forward to staying here again on my next…,
1,Can't fault it,I stayed here over thanksgiving for 4 days and I think it is probably one of the nicest city hotels I have ever stayed in. Location is good| but away from the real hecticness of the city... The staff were great| really helpful and friendly. Our room was a really good size| especially for New york and were well equipped. The complimentary wine and cheese every evening was such a nice touch and was a great start to an evening out.   I would go back and stay here any time I am lucky enough to return to NYC and would recommend to anyone else,
10,What a fab hotel,We stayed at the giraffe for five days from thanksgiving. What a fab hotel the staff could not be more helpful. The rooms perfect bed cosy and comfortable with great pillows- very important there are so many hotels out there with soft pillows. It was really quiet at night and the complementary breakfast in the morning perfect. A bonus is the wine and cheese from five to eight| a nice relaxant after shopping. We will certainly be back and would recommend this hotel to everybody.,
78,Stylish and well run,This is a very nice hotel particularly if you like being just below the midtown Manhattan streets.  Rooms are spacious by New York standards| very well fitted| and the staff are energetic and helpful.  The happy hour in the lobby lounge is a nice touch.  All in all| a very professional establishment with an informal air to it.,
2,Great Hotel!,Great stay at the Hotel Giraffe!  Service was great.  Nice to have breakfast & wine included.  Rooms are spacious for NYC.  Per some of the other reviews:  It IS noisy in the room with the sleeper sofa| but the bedrooms were surprisingly quite.  We will definitely be back!                ,
3,Nice and clean,Really nice hotel. It's new| it's clean and the staff is ok. The wine and cheese in the afternoon where the cherry to the cake! After a long day walking all over a glass of wine is very much appreciated! This hotel is a little bit expensive but for NY and it's location it's worth it.,
2,Anoter great stay at the Giraffe,In mid November we spent 4 nights at the Giraffe| along with two friends.  This was our second stay at the Giraffe and the first for our friends.  They were thrilled with the Giraffe and can't wait to join us there again. The front desk/door staff were friendly and really helpful with directions and bookings.  The staff supporting the breakfast and cocktails hour were terrific. Keep up the good work! E & J,
57,"A "" neck"" above other boutique hotels",Stayed over a weekend in the summer and found it to be a delightful| hospitable| and low key boutique. Service was excellent and downstairs inviting with wine and cheese served in early evening and coffee and fruit in the morning. Walking distance to restaurants and cultural attractions including the High Line. Would stay in this area and this hotel again. Good  Value! ,
118,Hidden Gem in Big Apple,Having travelled to New York City a number of times in the past| I have to say the Hotel Giraffe exceeded all expectations. This is a hidden gem in the Big Apple! Service| the hallmark of true luxury| is sublime! The setting is breathtaking - and made for the best hotel experience I have had in a long time!  From the moment my mom and I arrived on the property till we departed the customer service of the entire staff was extraordinaire. I am huge on customer service and this staff exceeded all of my expectations beginning with our arrival! The staff was extremely lovely and accommodating. They went out of their way to make us feel welcome and at home. They could not have offered a higher level of customer service. Having such a great option for breakfast| daily reception and…,
81,Totally OK but overpriced,We were a bit disappointed by this hotel to be honest. Having read some of the reviews here on TA| we thought it would be more of a chic boutique hotel in the European sense of a boutique hotel. It's not. I think that most of guests at the hotel are from North America and that the hotel| from North American standards| is a boutique hotel.   We had a room with a balcony on the second floor. The room was OK| quite spacious with a comfortable bed| but it was dark and the balcony was completely useless. The space of the room was not used to its full benefits and some things| like the TV| were placed in awkward locations. We were also disappointed that there was no kettle in the room. Breakfast was OK but really nothing special. We didn't try the cheese and wine. Location of the…,
21,Lovely stay at the Giraffe,We stayed at the Giraffe for one night and had a very nice stay.  The really nice touch which the Giraffe did well was the breakfast selection in the morning which was very relaxed and also afternoon cheese and wine.  Only negative was that lounge area was quite cold and a number of other people were still wrapped up.  Saying that the food/drink quality was good and the staff were helpful and friendly.  We booked a standard double room and although it was clean and stylish| it was small with not a lot of space to move around| which we were slightly disappointed with.  We were on a low floor and there was noise from the street but nevertheless had a good stay.  I would stay at the Giraffe again should we be in that part of NYC.,
49,Fantastic Boutique Hotel w/ Great Location,I come to NYC 2 to 3 times per year and usually stay a week at a time and I am always looking for a Hotel that feels like home.  This is the place!!! The rooms are just the right size with a very comfortable bed| nice sheets and excellent pillows. The bathroom has everything you could possibly need and was very well kept. The wifi was very good and the breakfast was simple but to the point. However| the best part of my visit was the excellent service by the staff that were always willing to assist and help with a huge smile on their face.,
84,Excellent perfectly located hotel,Location is excellent: very close to 28th st subway station which can take directly up to Downtown Financial District (Wall St. or Ground Zero) or in the opposite direction to Grand Central Station or Central Park (Metropolitan Museum) Area is safe and nice looking - real New York| not like touristy Time Sq| walking distance to Madison Sq or Union Sq We managed to walk from the hotel to Time Sq in 20 min Hotel is very cosy with rooms of a descent size (for New York)| clean| very well equipped. Corner suite with a balcony is a real gem with views over Park Ave Windows do have double glazing and good sound proofness| so we have not mentioned any serious disturbing street noise (anyway its New York) Bed was quite firm but very very comfortable (which was perfect for us but one can…,
2,Great hotel with great staff,This was my first ever visit to the US and I had booked the hotel as a surprise birthday treat for my boyfriend. The hotel was great| we had a spacious room with a little balcony and complimentary bottles of water. The location was great and within walking distance of the Flatiron building| Madison Square Park within a few more blocks you can get to Empire State  building and Macys.  We loved the fact we had access to free wifi| coffee and biscuits 24/7| fab breakfast which included fresh fruit| bagels| croissants| pastry| hard boiled eggs| cereal| OJ| and different types of coffee drink.    The real asset were the staff| in particular Simona who was so lovely and pointed out some really great places to visit and things to do| as well as Mike who was able to give some great…,
28,The best Manhattan hotel I ever stayed in,So unlike Manhattan| So good... This hotel does not have doormen in fancy uniform| nor a Lobby that looks like the living room of the rich and famous. What it has are very comfortable and cozy rooms (We had a balcony! in Manhattan!)| great atmosphere and the best service we ever got in Manhattan: always smiling| always attentive.  It is not located at the centre of things| but it is mere 200m from a metro station. Great hotel. Will definitley go back!,
1,335,Lovely hotel with nice view,I really like all their hotels| but Library hotel and Giraffe are my favourite. Good comfortable beds| very good service everywhere in the hotel.  Breakfast very limited| but the cheese and wine afternoon offer is really a nice gesture and good as a break from busy NYC.   I stayed in a suite| I can't recommend it enough.   Looking forward to be back.
50,Some of the Best Amenities We've Seen!,Our stay with Hotel Giraffe was more than we could have expected. All of the staff is welcoming and the hotel itself was beautiful. The morning started with a full breakfast included for all the guests that left us full for most of the day! If you need a snack or a quick coffee pick me up| they have an espresso machine and pastries available all day| and to top it off every evening you can join them for their complimentary wine and cheese reception.    The atmosphere was relaxed and the beds were comfortable! We both had to get some work done while we were in NYC so we appreciated the free WIFI at the hotel. The location allowed us to walk to most places or jump on the nearby train if we were going further.   We would definitely recommend Hotel Giraffe if you are visiting NYC|…,
59,Great boutique hotel!,I recently stayed at the Hotel Giraffe with my aunt and sister. We reserved the king suite with balcony view which was perfect for the 3 of us. It was spacious enough and the main bedroom had doors to separate it from the living area. The bathroom was a nice size| although with only one sink. Our tub was clogged on the day we were leaving| but seemed fine the other days we were there. There is a lot of closet and storage space| along with a safe| 2 robes| slippers| mini bar and complimentary water bottles. Turn down service is also available. My aunt said the sleep sofa was comfortable and she enjoyed the large flat screen tv and balcony view in her area. Just to be clear| the balcony is more like 2 large windows where you can step out onto an enclosed ledge and look out| but it…,
13,Confirmation of a good choice,Back to Hotel Giraffe after 3 years to confirm that this is one of the best options in NY. Same good service| nice room| good complimentary breakfast and happy hour| free wi-fi are among the good reasons for keeping coming back.,
375,Yeah| really great place,Agree with most everything written about the Giraffe| it was a really nice hotel with great furnishings in the rooms and top quality throughout.  Location in lower midtown is also excellent.  But what really sets it apart is the wine and cheese and free breakfast in the lounge/open room on the main floor; both were very good| much better than I expected| and a really unique touch for a hotel that is generally a good value in the higher end bracket in NY city.  Excellent choice for a weekend visit.,
168,Very good!,Nice hotel| beautiful decor| spacious room with a floor to ceiling window. The breakfast is good and we loved the happy hour with sparkling wine| red wine| fruits| pastries| nuts. Very good price x benefits. I had a lot of packages coming in and they hold all of them withou charge.,
1,A little gem in the city!,Just about every aspect of this hotel was outstanding| especially the service and attention to detail.  I have stayed at many hotels in NYC| most of which cost more and deliver a lot less. The hotel room even featured a nice little balcony for some fresh air and a view of the city streets.  I will be back!       ,
34,Excellent As Usual,Great experience as usual at The Giraffe.  New construction compared to older hotels; still have air conditioning in guest rooms from Oct-April unlike 95% of most other NYC hotels.  That is critical on warm fall or spring days in orderto sleep at night.  Staff is great; never snobbish.  Highly recommend.,
17,Wonderful stay in New York!!!,As a result of using the Trip Advisor recommendations we ended up booking the Giraffe Hotel for our 2 week stay in Manhattan.My husband and I and our 11 year old daughter chose a trip to New York for an anniversary celebration.The Giraffe was chosen because we needed a room for 3 people but we preferred a separate space for our daughter.We chose  a Classic King Suite which had a pull out sofa bed and her own TV.This set up worked perfectly because we all had a quiet private space but still close enough to be together as a family. The breakfast was fresh and very satisfying with cereal|toast loads of fresh fruit|yogurt and boiled eggs.The free WIFI was a boon and loved by one and all as was the evening drinks and nibbles Mmmmmm lovely!! We would like to thank the friendly ladies…,
50,Great Little Boutique Hotel in the Big Apple!,NYC is one busy city 24/7| but you can get away from the madding crowds at this little hotel.  Suite room was large enough for a 6 night stay and pretty well appointed. With a good coffee bar| continental breakfast each AM and live piano jazz| wine and cheese each afternoon at 5:00 PM the house offers an almost sophisticated family feel.  Would we return being the big question; Yes!,
15,always a delight,Sometimes the best surprise is no surprise - second visit a charm! Hotel Giraffe aims to please on so many levels - great rooms| service and a can do attitude! From the charming complimentary cocktail to the attentive service| it is a true delight to stay at this hotel - every request is greeted with a desire to please. Rooms are spacious| clean and comfortable. Our request for late check out was no problem and any information we needed was quickly provided| we will be back!,
5,New York Short Break,We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights last month and highly recommend it. We had a junior suite as there were 3 of us. The room was very spacious. The complementary continental breakfast was very good as was the complementary wine and cheese in the evening. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We had room service which is provided by the Bread & Tulip restaurant| and which was excellent.,
15,Had a lovely stay,I had 2 nights at Hotel Giraffe.  It is in a fabulously handy area with some great shopping! Lovely comfortable room with balcony which was really nice. On the evening I arrived it had been heavily raining all day and continued into the night so I had dinner at Bread & Tulips which is downstairs next to the hotel and the servece & food was excellent!  Through the hotel I organised a car to collect me from JFK which was great and meant that I didn't have to come off a flight from Sydney and look for a taxi!  The 'happy hour' for guests is a really nice touch and the complimentary breakfast great!  I would certainly stay again on my next visit to New York!,
285,Perfect Location,Spent 3 nights at the Giraffe and we are return visitors.  Staff is fantastic and friendly.  The rooms are nice and for NY quite spacious.  It is a nice size of a hotel and it feels more European.  It serves a very nice Continental Breakfast with unlimited coffee.  Newspapers are in th lobby for sharing.  During the day there are beverages and cookies. In the evening you are treated to wine and cheese before going out on the town.  It is a perfect loction... close to The Village and easy enough to walk Uptown if you wish.  Subway is close by and since you are on Park Ave. S there are lots of taxis going both ways.,
2,Excellent stay at Hotel Giraffe,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel Giraffe| from the comfortable beds and beautiful rooms| to the delicious breakast and wine/cheese every evening. Great location for access throughout the city| and very helpful/pleasant staff.,
22,Last night treat in NYC,We had spent several weeks travelling around and wanted to have a treat for our last night in NYC.  I don't think we could have picked better than the Giraffe.  The location (close to everything but not super-busy) was ideal for us| as was being across the street from the subway.  The check in was friendly and efficient and the room| with our little balcony with a view down Park Avenue| was large and nicely decorated| with cute touches like some interesting books on the shelf to look at.  We were presently surprised by the quantity and quality of the little extras included with the room cost: wi-fi| excellent wine and cheese and a good breakfast (with a great coffee machine| which is rare in NYC in my experience) all provided gratis.  Unfortunately| we didn't have time to…,
20,A really great hotel,Just spent 3 days at the giraffe and thought it was perfect. The room was not tiny | the service was kind and attending and the breakfast was just what one needs to start the day.  I definitely want to come back,
1,Wonderful hotel,This was our first time in New York and couldn't have wished for a better hotel. The staff were so friendly and helpful| nothing was too much trouble. The complimentary breakfasts were lovely and took place in a really pleasant lobby area. The bedroom we had was a suite and it was worth every penny we paid with excellent facilities and furniture. The location is quite superb with subway stations very close and Grand Central Terminal a short walk up the Avenue. All in all a great place to stay.  October 2013  B&M W from Cheshire,
205,Stellar Staff,Jose| Jayla| Ashley| Front Desk| Wine&Cheese Bar| Breakfast Bar| housekeeping. Giraffe Staff makes this the best stay in Manhattan. It's the reason we keep coming back.   Dr.&Mrs. Gary & Carol Levine thesidetrek.com,
61,Wonderful place to stay in NYC,We stayed at the Hotel Giraffe on a little trip to NYC for our 30th anniversary. I would never have known of the place if not for Tripadvisor's reviews. The hotel is located in the Flatiron district| a great area of the city. I loved the fact that the hotel was in not one of the huge overcrowded areas like Times Square. The staff were warm and friendly| the lobby was cozy and featured continental breakfast in the morning and wine and cheese at night. The rooftop lounge was lovely| but it was a little too cold to use it. I booked a suite for our trip| and the room was very comfortable. All in all I would highly recommend this hotel.,
1,Amazing stay at Hotel Giraffe!,As former residents of NYC and frequent travelers there| my Husband and I stumbled upon this gem of a Hotel by accident as part of a wedding block.   Not only was the room spacious| clean and comfortable| the service was amazing!  There was a beautiful breakfast spread every morning| free coffee throughout the day and wine and cheese in the evenings.  The staff was amazingly helpful- everything from cleaning up the room for the bride and groom to helping with directions and restaurant recommendations.  The other great thing about this hotel is it's location!  Situated outside the hustle and bustle of Time Square| we had easy access to all of our usual haunts downtown/Union Square as well as the wedding festivities in Central Park.   This is now the ONLY hotel I will stay at in…,
57,Nice Boutique Hotel reasonable rates for Manhattan,This small hotel on Park Avenue S is ideally placed for a Manhattan trip whether business or pleasure. It is small quiet and very well appointed. The rooms are not huge but large given the usual size of Hotel rooms in New York.  The breakfast is serve yourself and varied and the quiet lounge area is a good central meeting place for coffee. There are always opportunities to cut the hotels rack rates and the beds are comfortable bathrooms pretty lux' and the are staff friendly. I would definitely stay there again and have recommended it to friends.,
23,Extraordinary Service,I chose the hotel because we were visiting our daughter and wanted a comfortable homelike atmosphere.  The lobby has a lovely meeting place where there are refreshments placed out all day and evening.  They serve a wonderful complimentary continental breakfast. The pastries are to die for.  The staff is so attentive.  Everything you ask for you get and with a gracious smile.  The rooms are comfortable| serene and you can ask for a feather bed topper because the beds are somewhat firm.  The bathroom is large and beautifully appointed.  I am a former New Yorker and have stayed in many hotels in Manhattan| this by far is the best.,
2,Excellent in every way.,We stayed for 2 nights and wished it was longer. The staff were very helpful and friendly| The breakfast was lovely and the early evening drinks and nibbles were great. Great location too. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.,
51,Great Boutique Hotel,We stayed for a ing weekend at Hotel Giraffe. The location is perfect for moving around the city. Walking distance to Broadway| Times Square| and Upper East Side Its a bit of a hike to Central Park and 5th Ave shopping| but its easy to catch a quick cab.  The service here is excellent. The hotel held our bags during our early checking| and held them late as we played in the city at the end of day on Monday.  The breakfast is mostly coffee| juice| fruit| cereals and muffins. The espresso machine pumps out great self serve coffee drinks.  We had a two room suite which was clean| comfortable and quiet - even though on the third floor corner to Park Avenue traffic.We discovered a great local sports bar around the corner on Lexington - Barfly| along with a short walk to Pizza and…,
16,My new favorite hotel in NYC,My husband and I enjoyed a three-night stay at Hotel Giraffe earlier this month| and can't wait to return! Our room was very nice and comfortable| the staff friendly| and the location of the hotel excellent.,
170,An Excellent Hotel!,A few weeks ago I and three lady friends were guests at this excellent hotel. Everything was absolutely wonderful from the moment we entered. The staff was welcoming| courteous and helpful. Our room was very spacious (we never once tripped over each other)| quiet and clean. The beds were most comfortable and the linens and towels were luxurious| as were the bathroom amenities. A delicious breakfast was included and wine and cheese was served in the early evening. Certainly a nice way to end a day of shopping/sightseeing! The hotel is convenient to the subway and is within walking distance to shops and restaurants. This is my second visit here| the first being with my husband. The ladies could not say enough about this hotel and the consensus was that they would definitely stay…,
14,Great location,This hotel's location was perfect for both uptown| downtown and west-side activities.  Subway stops were close by.  The staff was wonderful in suggesting routes to where we wanted to go| and they also booked a car with tax| tolls| tips included for us to get back to the airport.  The 1pm checkout time allowed us a morning museum visit.    The breakfast offerings were fresh pastries| bagels| fruit salad| boiled eggs| hot and cold cereals| yogurt.  A cappuccino machine was available and a large variety of teas.  The regular coffee was a bit weak| and lukewarm|  unfortunately. The breakfast staff was hustling daily to make sure tables were available| bagels or bread was toasted| coffee refilled. Fresh apples and bananas were available in the lobby all day long!! -- A very nice…,
75,We love the Giraffe,The Giraffe is a high quality hotel; you pay a lot but you also get a lot. We love the afternoon receptions and the breakfasts. We love the lobby--it is elegant and welcoming. The service is good; people are polite and not pretentious. ,
22,Excellent stay Hotel Giraffe as always,I stay in manhattan as a getaway atleast once or twice a year.  I've stayed in so many different hotels because I like to experience them all.  However| Hotel Giraffe is the only one I have stayed at more than once.  Service is excellent| and the wine and cheese/breakfast for hotel guests is an endearing touch.  Most importantly all the staff is courteous and friendly which you cannot say about all hotel staff in NYC.,
37,Superb Choice in NYC,The Hotel Giraffe is both elegant and friendly.  Located near Madison Park| two subway lines| and great restaurants| it is the perfect place to call home when you visit NYC for business or pleasure.  The service is outstanding| as are the amenities.  The hotel offers free (and delicious) breakfasts and evening wine and cheese offerings.  The adjacent restaurant| Bread & Tulips| offers a discount for Giraffe visitors.,
37,Quiet Retreat,I loved coming back to our room after a long day of shopping and having the afternoon wine and cheese.  The hotel is a short walk to shopping and restaurants.  The room we had was quiet and the staff friendly and helpful.  I had them arrange a car service to the hotel and back to the airport for me and it worked out well.  I would definitely stay there again.,
2,A great hotel we would recommend,An excellent 'haven' in NYC.  Staff are welcoming and helpful and the rooms are exceptionally clean and comfortable. The breakfasts are good and we very much enjoyed the evening ambience in the lounge with wine and snacks available. It's central location makes it ideal for exploring the city. We would recommend this hotel and would stay here again.,
39,afternoon wine and cheese,I love little boutique hotels in big cities that offer afternoon refreshments and breakfast without charging more than the big hotels. The staff is super friendly and helpful. They have a rooftop sitting area that was unfortunately closed while we were there but looks nice and would be great if the weather cooperates. the rooms are nothing particularly special but nice and clean. We had a balcony room which just creates more noise than ambiance. Overall a very good stay and I would return.,
1,NYC Trip,The most positive aspect of this hotel was the staff. They were courteous| accommodating| and extremely helpful. The front desk was knowledgeable and able to answer all questions regarding directions and transportation. The staff personnel provided for a very friendly atmosphere.,
7,First visit to New York,We really enjoyed our stay in Hotel Giraffe with our teenage son.  The service was great| rooms attractive and comfortable| and complimentary breakfasts (fresh fruit salad| yoghurt| selection of cereals and pastries| bagels| croissants| etc) and wine and cheese receptions a big plus.  We had a suite with a King sized bed and sofa bed in the lounge - bed was very comfortable.  There were TVs in both rooms and three wardrobes.  The area has plenty of restaurants and is very close to Madison Square Park and Union Square.  There are shopping opportunities nearby and you can walk to the mid-town area.  Subway stations are a block or two away and can take you anywhere you need to go.  We found the staff really helpful with bookings for attractions and shows.  My only (very small)…,
8,Nice room!,"Overall excellent stay. Staff was very polite. The room was very nice however I would recommend getting the ""matress topper"" the bed was hard. Maybe I am just spoiled with my awesome mattress at home| so it makes me biased. Also| we decided to eat at Bread & Tulips because are room did have a peak of the menu. It showed they offered steak but after we made reservations and was seated the steak was not on the menu they had and was not available at all. That was a disappointment. Guess they should update that. When we checked out I had thought I left something behind and called the front desk the gentleman that answered my call did an awesome job and sent a bell hop right away to check. He call me back within five minutes to let me know that they couldn't find what I was looking…",
1,Wonderful Stay in NYC,Hotel Giraffe staff provided a very pleasant stay in NYC. The staff were calm| warm| helpful| and efficient. The room was very comfortable. I felt there was attention to my safety and comfort. A long day of meetings| networking| and business can be exhausting. On returning to the room| I found the bed turned down| the lights gently on| and relaxing music greeted me after a long day - it was most welcomed! Would recommend this hotel to those traveling to NYC. ,
9,Fantastic Hotel in Great NYC Location,We recently stayed in the Hotel Giraffe and thought the place was fantastic.  It's all about the extra's!  Apart from the room and service being exceptional| we loved the included breakfast| free drinks and canapés and roof top area!  Both the reception desk and concierge were really helpful with anything we asked| which made our New York experience even better! We loved our room| which had the added lounge (worth it if you're doing extra shopping or just want a sitting space) - and it was huge in comparison to other hotels I've stayed at.  Totally recommend this hotel for your holiday stay.,
63,Breakfast,I am a born and bred New Yorker but travel extensively and intensively| 85 countries in total. Almost always stay in Trip advisor highly recommended boutique hotels or guest houses. I presently live in Ecuador and will be visiting NYC quarterly. Hotel Giraffe is now my hotel of choice - great service and fabulous surrounding neighborhoods. My only disappointment is the breakfasts. I am very familiar with Sarabeths and agree it is a viable alternative. But frankly| the breakfast at the hotel ranks close to the bottom of the list of the many hotels and guesthouses i have stayed at world-wide For me| at a minimum I would like to have   fried eggs | sunny side up| and nova scotia salmon on a toasted bagel with cream cheese and raw- onion(my favorite),
55,Superb,As novices to New York and to the States generally| Tripadvisor came up trumps yet again with this little gem for our five night stay.  The room was stylish with a modern twist and as we were on the seventh floor| we were slightly away from what noise there was (it is NY after all).  The location was excellent.  Ten minutes on foot to the bohemian Madison Square Park and its gaggle of permanent food vendors| 10 minutes to the Empire State| 20 minutes to Grand Central and 30 or so minutes to the bottom of Central Park. The room rate is not cheap| but the breakfast and the classy but not staid wine sessions between 5-8pm every evening| including a selection of cheeses and savoury snacks| really were the perfect start to a stroll to one of many nearby bars and restaurants.  We…,
133,This is where you want to stay!,We came on a Thursday| and stayed 4 nights. The booking was swift| and the correspondence with the hotel was great. They where very helpful. We booked an airport pickup from the airport to the hotel| which we would recommend. The breakfast is exactly what you need| but some ham would be great. Cheese and wine in the evening was perfect after a long day. The rooms nice and roomy. Would definitely stay here again.,
33,Very good| but not my style,The hotel is exceptionally clean| very cute| and the staff is as good as you will find in the city.  However| does lack in a few areas.  There is no real room service.  You can have the cereal and such from the lobby brought to your room| but it is not a great experience.  That said| what struck me most was the energy.  I needed a very quiet| kind hotel for a business trip.  This is the perfect place.  But| if you are looking for a little trendier place or a few amenities| there are other places in NYC.  Giraffe is your place if you want very little hotel traffic and just the quieter vibe.,
80,Great Boutique Hotel in Perfect Location,We just got back from a great stay. Very nice room on the 4th floor. The bed was very firm. The bathroom is nice. Lots of storage in the room. The staff was very attentive with questions and quickly bringing up ice or whatever else you need. The hotel was sold out| but did not seem crowded and never waited for an elevator. The location is perfect. We spent a lot of time in lower Manhattan but also got up to the upper west side and never had a problem finding a cab to bring us back. I don't think we ever spent more than $12 on one. It's the perfect location. If you're a walker like us| we walked to Central Park one day and SoHo another. No problem. The terrace on the 12th floor was nice| but the $12 drinks were the weakest I've ever had. During the day there was rarely anyone…,
1,Always a perfect stay at the Hotel Giraffe !!,We chose to stay at the Hotel Giraffe on numerous occasions| and most importantly| on our wedding night. What can I say| the hotel is absolutely wonderful. The service is impeccable – the staff was so accommodating with providing everything we needed| and even things that we didn’t realize we needed (i.e. bar stools delivered to our suite for hair/makeup styling). The rooms are spacious and comfortable| with modern décor and most with a wonderful view of Park Avenue.  For our wedding night| they decorated the room with beautiful red rose petals.  The hotel itself it situated perfectly on classy Park Ave| with easy access to the train station and few blocks away from the flatiron district and amazing NYC shopping !! And the best part is unwinding to your fill of wine and cheese…,
104,Perfect Hotel!,I booked this hotel last minute using Hotel Tonight| but I will happily book it again and again.  Hotel Giraffe is a perfect hotel.  The access at the corner of 26th and Park is very easy--cabs are plentiful all day and night long and you are 1.5 blocks from the subway.  The lobby is bright and welcoming| but not at all loud or crazy.  The breakfast is simple| but ample and the wine/cheese reception in the afternoon is a lovely touch.  There is also a rooftop garden which is simple| but adds just another nice touch.  Inside| the rooms are spacious by NY standards and well appointed with everything a traveler needs from plenty of power ports to plenty of surface space to plenty of storage including a large closet with full size mirrors.  The king size bed is incredibly…,
8,Hotel Giraffe,Haad a wonderful time with our 10 year old grandson for his birthday trip.  Staff was great -- birthday cupcake in the room for grandson; everyone we met wished him happy birthday.  Happy Hour and breakfast were just great.  Room was just right for us. Great collection of DVD's to borrow.  Used room service and the meal was very good.,
5,Disappointed,The room was clean and spacious. The complimentary breakfast reminded me of something you'd get at Motel 6 or Super 8. Cheap| cheap| cheap. The minibar had the worst selections of snacks imaginable. Good service? Sometimes. Good location. Way| way over priced. They have a high opinion of themselves. This is not an elite hotel.,
9,Great hotel| but be aware of noise on low floor balcony rooms,I've previously stayed in the sister hotel (Library Hotel| also excellent) and went for this hotel in the hope of something new and also equivalent good service. No regrets on the choice| enjoyable stay in a good easy to access location in Midtown. Clean| pleasant| good service. Furthermore we made a few challenges for the hotel on room changes| date changes etc and never got any hassle or issues back| which isn't always the case when dealing with hotels.  My one complaint is that being in a balcony room low down on one night| I had some issues when sleeping on a lower level with noise coming through the balcony doors. Its inevitable with the loose sealing large doors that you will get some noise getting through late at night - its not the hotels fault| but its annoying when you…,
19,Simply Great!,We stayed at Hotel Giraffe for one week in September and found out that all the positive Tripadvisor reviews did not lie: Large rooms (compared to New York standard)| scrupulous cleanliness| impeccable service and a cozy ambiance. The hotel's location is unbeatable - ideal for all daytime and evening acitivities| but far away from midtown's noisiness. The rooftop garden is awesome (although| unfortunately| not operated on all evenings despite the warm weather). Thanks to the Hotel Giraffe team for making us feel at home!,
57,a diamond in midtown Manhatten,it's allways pleasent to write a review about a hotel we enjoyed! we stayed in a king suite (room 1101) for 3 nights with our daughter and loved every moment! the suite is not too large| but very comfort and clean. our bed was very  comfortable. our daughter slept on a soffa that was pulled out and wasn't too cosy as it's  springs were noisy| but all other things were great and very spoily - the afternoon wine and cheese was very tranquill way to start the evening after a day on the noisy streets. we shall recomend this hotel to our friends.,
59,Small boutique that is a gem,I stayed here in September 2011| my first time ever in NYC-Being that it is a boutique that means things are smaller| such as the reception area-It can get a bit crowded when you walk in| and the elevator as well-Slowest thing ever and small-  On to the good| our room had a living room and a bedroom-To be honest we only used the bedroom section-The bathroom was small but nice| funny thing is that it had a glass panel on the door so you could kind of see what was going on in the bathroom-I mention this b/c this was the first time I had ever traveled with my boyfriend-I was mortified that he could see me pee! We laugh now about it but it is odd if you are not comfortable with the person you are staying with ;)  The best thing about this hotel is the breakfast and wine/cheese in…,
1,Excellent stay!,Hotel Giraffe deserves its great reputation! They took great care of us during our extended weekend stay. This hotel takes great effort to address the needs and concerns of travelers in the middle of a big city. We will definitely be returning whenever we stay in NYC.,
3,Truly excellent hotel,My family and I stayed at the Giraffe in August for 5 nights. We had two rooms next to each other| one with a living area which suited us perfectly. The rooms are comfortable| clean and well-appointed. The staff were more than welcoming (even when we arrived 6 hours late at 2am) and were always happy to help with whatever we needed. The complimentary breakfast was a great addition| with plenty to choose from. A special mention has to go to the wonderful girls who run the breakfasts so efficiently and went out of their way to accommodate us. The location of the hotel was perfect; close to a couple of subway stations and a walkable distance to a number of major attractions. The free wi-fi was also a great bonus. We hope to return to the Giraffe in the not-too-distant future and…,
66,Fantastic visit to NYC,This hotel is a gem in mid-town Manhatten.  Close to the subway and there is so many places you can walk in the vicinity.  I would definitely recommend this boutique hotel as it is a quiet spot with not so many guests.  The breakfast is a wonderful plus as is the complimentary wine and cheese.,
1,Terrific Accomodations,Our stay at Hotel Giraffe was a pleasure. The staff was accommodating and not pretentious in any way. The room was beautiful| extremely clean and the decor was very classic yet modern. The rooftop was spectacular! It doesn't feel like a standard hotel| but like a residence.This is our second visit to this hotel in 2 months| and we look forward to our next stay at Hotel Giraffe.,
1,Great Hotel,I stayed here with my wife for a week. WOW. Amazing Hotel. Awesome location. Brilliant staff. Highlight was the breakfast which is a leisurely serve yourself affair and free afternoon drinks and chesse and crackers. They say it is the little things that make a difference. So true when it comes to this hotel,
7,Great hotel in New York,My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights. We had a lovely room on the 7th floor. The staff are all very friendly and extremely helpful. Kathleen was especially helpful when we had a problem with our credit card on checking in which was much appreciated. The location is perfect| a nice area which had some lovely restaurants nearby. Great for accessing the subway which was really easy to use.  The rooms are great.  We asked for a mini fridge and a mattress topper. Nothing seemed to be a problem. There was even a bottle of wine left in the room as it was my birthday. Great having free wi fi in the room. Continental breakfasts were ideal and kept us going till lunch time. The icing on the cake was the wine and nibbles from 5 till 8 every night for free. Great to come back…,
2,Nice and very friendly hotel in New York,We (me| my wife and our 24 year old son) stayed at the Giraffe in September 13 for four days. We were impressed by the friendliness of the staff| the good location close to all the main attractions and the underground| the clean and nicely decorated infrastructure and - considering the location - also the price. We especially liked the ease with which we could accommodate our son for two nights in our small suite| the breakfast (free of charge and you could even invite friends etc.) and the afternoon wine and snack at the lobby. Overall| we can highly recommend this hotel and will certainly come back.,
91,Great location and outstanding service,We stayed 7 nights in a suite at this terrific hotel. It was our last leg of a 6 week world holiday. From the moment I booked| asked questions| requested a driver to pick us up from the port| everyone was helpful and nothing too much trouble.  When we checked in JR was super helpful and identified that because I had medication that required refrigeration he organised another small fridge to store them without me asking! How customer focussed is that. Special mention also to Simone| Mike and Brian. In other words everyone we encountered provided us with great service and made us feel special.  The room was large and comfortable and ours was on the corner of Park Ave and E 26th. The double glazing definately reduced the noise but lets face it New Yorkers love using their car horns…,
4,Great Hotel in New York,Loved the hotel| staff were helpful| friendly and very efficient. It was close to everything| subway| taxi ranks etc. Loved the piano playing and wine and cheese each afternoon. Clean and spacious rooms and will definitely be staying here again| next time I am in the Big Apple :-),
55,Well located| classy hotel,Enjoyed a week in NYC.  Hotel Giraffe was very well appointed| we had a king suite| so plenty of room. Balcony was too small to enjoy| but even with the doors open the noise wasn't too bad. Staff were excellent| discreet and helpful. Loved the wine and cheese each night| a very nice way to start your evening. Breakfast was also very good| we really enjoyed the club hotel  vibe.,
77,High quality hotel,My wife and I spent a couple of nights here at the end of a two week visit to the East Coast. The Giraffe is the best hotel we have ever stayed at in Manhattan. The location was not our preferred area but we found it fine for all the things we had planned and relatively quiet. The decorative quality and finishing here are very good indeed; so many New York hotels are just shabby. The staff were all delightful| welcoming and efficient. Our room on the 7th floor was quiet| large and comfortable and the bathroom was clean and well fitted. Breakfast in the lobby is included and offers good choices. We really liked the wine and snacks offering in the evening| just perfect after a busy day in the city. We found some great Indian restaurants round the corner from the hotel on Lexington…,
66,Great service,We arrived late to this hotel and wanted a glass of wine.  The bar was closed but the staff sent us a complimentary bottle to the room. The rooms are well appointed and quiet even though on a busy street. The balcony is kind of a mute point as you can't sit out there on it. The beds were comfortable and the location is great. They have a complimentary breakfast in the lobby. The staff are very friendly. I would stay here again.,
1,Impeccable service and a great location!!,Hotel Giraffe is a warm and welcoming oasis| nestled in the heart of the New York bustle.  The hotel was cosy| clean and comfortable where you could share a complimentary wine and cheese evening| reflecting on the day's activities. Waking up to their continental breakfast which was more than substantial (loved the oven-fresh bagels!) we felt rested and invigorated to take on another exciting adventure NYC had to offer. Thank you to all the staff who made our stay not only welcoming| but one of the memorable highlights of our trip to the USA.,
28,What a lovely hotel,This is a great hotel in a quieter part of Manhattan.  The staff were very  helpful with every aspect of our stay.  We particularly enjoyed the wine | cheese and nibbles between 5 and 7pm| we will be back.,
17,Great base for exploring Manhattan,My boyfriend did extensive research before booking the Hotel Giraffe| and it definitely paid off.  Our room| which by Manhattan standards was huge| was on the 7th floor with a balcony overlooking Park Avenue yet we were never disturbed by the street noise.    The daily cheese and wine reception is a lovely touch| and a great way to break the day up.  We had drinks in the rooftop bar (highlighted in the Stylist magazine as one of the coolest hangouts during NY Fashion Week) which is a lovely| quiet spot above the bustle.  Breakfast is included| and the buffet was fine - just time your breakfast carefully as there aren't that many tables.  The staff were all charming| and very helpful. I'd definitely stay here again and have recommended it to friends.,
3,Fantastic boutique hotel,Just returned from a honeymoon- we spent the first part of the trip in New York at this hotel| and I cannot say enough positive things about the service and the overall experience. The room was luxurious and absolutely huge (we did splash out and get a king size suite)| and very well appointed- lovely bathroom and the bed was so relaxing. The staff at the hotel were endlessly helpful and assisted us with absolutely everything| and always with an incredibly courteous manner. We felt 100% at home while staying there| and I would highly recommend it!,
2,Just right,"We had a girl's weekend in NYC to celebrate a special birthday.  Included were my two daughters| my best friend growing up| and her two nieces.  Having lived in NY for twelve years| I wanted a place to meet up with old friends and the breakfast and ""happy hour"" were perfect for that.  The staff was cheerful and very helpful!  The location was great| close to the subway| easy to get a cab| close to shopping| and accessible to great restaurants.  We will definitely come back!",
229,Great hotel and spot on Manhattan,We were staying |me and my husband and our daughter 17 for four nights in this hotel and it was a great hotel with the little extra such as 24 hr refreshment in the lobby with fruit|great coffemachine| tea| and every afternoon between 5-8 pm it was served wine and cheese. The hotel is situated perfect for subway| walks to Gramercy Park| Flatiron and Empire State Building and the staff here is really serviceminded.. we really felt us like home..In our room we had 2 queens Size beds |french balcony|and everything was perfect except for the noise from outside.  We lived on 7th floor but we heard everthing in to our room even the people down on the street talking. We know that we are in Manhattan and a big city and we are used to firetrucks| police and ambulance passing in the…,
1,First stay in NYC,This hotel was recommended by a friend who had lived in NYC. We stayed 5 nights in December for a shopping trip and we honestly couldn't fault the hotel| from the wonderful staff to the cleanliness. Comfy rooms and peace and quiet. We are returning again his December and have this hotel again. Excellent 10/10.,
11,Perfect!,Loved every minute of our time in New York and the hotel was a massive part of that! The cheese and wine| the breakfast| the gorgeous restaurant in the basement| the umbrellas available to borrow and especially the location. Perfect.,
8,New York| New York,This was our first time to New York and Hotel Giraffe was fantastic| exceeded our expectations.  The complimentary drinks were definitely a bonus.  The rooms were comfortable and the staff friendly and helpful. it is within walking distance of major shopping. The subway is just around the corner for access to all the touristy things.,
2,Hotel Giraffe - NYC,The family decided to have a last minute| fun-filled weekend in Manhattan.   The Hotel was able to accommodate our requests and they exceeded our expectations.   The Hotel is off and away from the Tourist parts of town| but provides a fantastic exposure to living in Manhattan and seeing the day-to-day as New Yorkers do.   Highly recommend this property whether you are along| a couple| or have children!,
2,Great Hotel for a Great Honeymoon,Great Location| friendly and welcoming staff. Great breakfast | and very tasty wine and cheese bar!!! Nice Roof top bar| options to get free vouchers to NY fitness club Got a bottle of wine for our honeymoon| a nice courtesy and much appreciated. Will stay there again next trip to NY!!       ,
37,Return visit and just as lovely. The guest is first for sure!,This is my third stay at Hotel Giraffe and they definitely met our very high expectations. The rooms were very comfortable and relatively quiet for New York. So many aspects of the staff and the services clearly put the guest first. The later check out time - 1 pm was really appreciated and we loved the complimentary wine and cheese in the evening (very generous in availability and offerings) and breakfast (ditto).  I also used the gym down the street| which they supplied a guest pass to. Overall| I have only compliments| no complaints.,
77,The place to stay in NYC,This hotel is just perfect for a short stay in Manhattan. It is well appointed and very good value with an excellent continental breakfast and wine and cheese party both included in the price. The staff are all very friendly and highly professional. We had a drink and shared a small pizza at the roof top bar before going to the theater| which was a perfect start to the evening. We found it by accident but I have already told friends that Hotel Giraffe is the place to stay when in NYC.,
75,great place !,Location is great | Staff are lovely| rooms are clean comfy and a good size. Breakfast is great and Free. Lovely wine served every evening . Its a real find this Hotel. Great prices and great value. Normally we stay at the Gramercy... this is better value and way more homey.,
2,Great experience,Beautiful small hotel well locted in Manhatan. Always clean. The personnel is young and devoted. The continental breakfast is perfect and the wine and chees every day is a good initiative. We will go back there when we go in NY.,
6,NYC visit,Our stay at Hotel Giraffe was wonderful from start to finish! The only thing I would change is| not spending the extra money on a balcony room. Although it was nice| not enough room to sit out there. The entire hotel promotes a feeling of relaxation and is very welcoming. The staff is wonderful as well. Very nice location too.                     ,
8,Good location| nice cozy hotel,"We wanted to visit Manhattan on foot and this hotel was a great place to start with. The rooms are nice and cozy. If you don't live in the downtown area of a big city then you may need a couple of days to get used to the  morning noise (all sorts of utility trucks| cars etc.) - for this reason I gave the ""Sleep quality"" a 3 star - the bed was quite comfy. The staff was very helpful with suggestions on how to enjoy a visit to NY. The breakfast was great and the complimentary cheese and wine in the early evening a nice touch. Listening to live piano music while enjoying a glass of wine| especially after a few good hours on foot in NY... nice| eh?",
78,Great Hotel,I only stayed here for one night but have to say| I had a great experience: Staff were very attentive and knowledgeable| overall atmosphere very relaxing| room well appointed and clean. The complimentary evening (5.00 - 8.00PM) cheese and wine along with the continental breakfast also made for good overall value. Definitely a hotel I will return to next time I am in New York.,
301,This place rocks! Rooftop garden is such a respite in the city,Stayed 2 nights on business.  Really nice rooms - clean modern and comfortable.  The hospitality is outstanding - continental| Euro-style breakfast and rooftop garden are wonderful amenities.  The place is expensive| but was perfectly located for my trip and worth the peace of mind.  I love the soothing music playing in my room after a hard day.  just what I needed to wind down.,
5,A great NYC hotel!,We stayed here on our honeymoon in March and loved the hotel. After requesting a balcony we were offered an immediate upgrade as it was our honeymoon and this was indicative of the excellent service we received throughout our stay. The hotel is not fancy in the lobby with a no frills small check-in counter| however this is still very neat. Aside from this there is a fantastic and very generous complimentary cheese and wine service every evening which gives you a chance to meet people or just enjoy an aperitif before heading out. There is also a great Italian restaurant in the basement of the of the hotel. The room was very large and the view quite lovely. If you don't mind walking we were within walking distance of lots of great boroughs-Noho| Soho| Little Italy etc. All in all…,
142,Quiet in Gramercy,I stayed 4 nights a this hotel in a King room with a balcony. It was nice and clean and had ample space. Very good for sleeping if you are tired. Very good wi fi also. I ordered a pick up service at the airport and the driver will not wait for me.  Breakfast is continental only which is healthy but might be limited to some. Room service is also limited but there are so many nice restaurants within 1 block of the hotel that I didn't miss it.,
186,Friendly and relaxed small hotel 15 minutes from Empire State Building,Stayed here for 8 days in August following TA reviews and personal recommendation. The hotel is small (7 rooms to each of its 10ish accommodation floors)| the staff get to recognise you and there was not the normal pressure to tip everyone who moved. Breakfasts are simple continental style buffet and free tea| coffee| fruit and biscuits throughout the day and wine| cheese and nibbles between 5 and 8 p.m. in the foyer seating area make for a pleasant way to spend the day and is much more sociable than retreating to your room.  We were also pleasantly surprised by the size of the room| kingsize bed and plenty more room and a courtesy umbrella. We stayed on floor 10 on the 23rd street side with no balcony and had only minimal road noise. The lack of a balcony I think made no…,
5,Great place to stay,Great value for money. Location is very good. Enjoyed very much the wine and cheese in the evenings. Friendly staff- helpful and not intrusive.Great bathroom and amenities. Lighting in the room could have been a little brighter                     ,
10,Review of 8 night stay in Hotel Giraffe| NYC,My wife and I| and two daughters (aged 19 & 21) have just returned to UK having spent 8 nights at the Hotel Giraffe.  It was my first time in NYC| and this Hotel was selected after spending a considerable amount of time reviewing options on both trip advisor and other sites.  We were not disappointed.  My wife had been in NYC before| and did not think this hotel would be as good as the one she stayed at previously. She admits that she was wrong (doesn't happen often!). The self service continental breakfasts each morning were first class| with a great selection on offer| and really did set you up for the day.   Tea/Coffee| biscuits| and fruit all available during the day| and the cheese and wine each night was excellent. I don't think there are too many hotels that provide this.…,
78,Fantastic,We had 13 nights in NYC at the Giraffe and had a brilliant time. The hotel made the trip! The oasis in the middle of manhattan was fantastic. The room was great and serviced very well ( twice daily often). The roof top was a great pace to relax during day or have a drink in the evening! The foyer coupled as a breakfast bar and club lounge - great! I think the biggest assets was the staff - they personally seemed interested. I would recommend this hotel to you and your friends - super!,
74,Highly recommended - great hotel & location,Although I have tried several other hotels near Times Square & Columbus Circle| this was my first stay around the Union Square area. I'll be back. It is so nice to be aware from the tourist hordes in midtown| but still be in an active area full of shops/restaurants with quick metro access to Grand Central| Noho| etc. This hotel first wins your heart with their welcoming staff| and we were really taken with Gabrielle's friendly service. Their lobby doubles as a pseudo-club lounge with complimentary breakfast| all day snacks/drinks and evening wine & cheese. Be warned - it was so nice to sit down to drinks and fruit/cookies after sightseeing that it was hard to leave! We liked our suite which was roomy with lots of closet space/hangers. Being away from Times Square| the rooms were…,
37,One of the best hotels in NYC,My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Giraffe as our first night away from our 21 month old.    Our night began with a wine and cheese happy hour and then were provided with a bottle of wine upon entering our room. The room had plenty of space and the bathroom was organized really well. Not super spacious but good counter space and a good shower.   The bed was a bit firm and not super comfortable| but we could have asked for a mattress topper.   In the morning the breakfast was perfect for what we needed (croissants| fruit| coffee) and we were also given wine and chocolates the night prior as an acknowledgement of our night away.   The only downside was that upon checkout we were given the wrong bill and it was approximately $200 less than what we were paying. When we asked how…,
105,Excellent location and service,We recently stayed two nights at the Giraffe -- our first stay| although like other reviewers| we have stayed at their chain's other property| the Hotel Elysee| as well. The Giraffe is in a great part of town| with easy access to restaurants and shopping. Noise was not a problem at all. We started out on the 11th floor with a queen size bed and decided we preferred a king. One call to the front desk and they made arrangements for us to move| no problem. They even transferred our luggage while we were out. We ended up on the 8th floor| and again no noise issue. As compared to the Elysee| the Giraffe is decorated in a more modern style and the bathrooms are larger| which was great. We did not take advantage of the breakfast and unfortunately missed the evening reception| but…,
3,Great hotel in great location with AWESOME staff,I read about the Hotel Giraffe in an inflight magazine on a WestJet flight I had recently taken.  The reviews here on TripAdvisor were great and it sounded like exactly what we wanted for the weekend.   The included breakfast was great -- I was able to have a gluten free bagel every day. My husband enjoyed the wine and cheese at the end of the day (I'm pregnant so I enjoyed the cheese & water).  The location is great.  The staff is very helpful and they seem totally relaxed.  ,
209,Great location| people & property,This was our 2nd stay and it did not disappoint. The staff is excellent| rooms are top notch and the free breakfast and cocktail hours perfect. If your searching for a mid town location this is the place. Don't count on an early checking| this place is busy!,
15,Nice leisure hotel| not good if you are in a hurry,I stayed in this hotel with my family in a suite style room with a pull-out couch which was much appreciated.  The beds were comfortable. The extras were great| continental breakfast| and coffee| tea| espresso drinks and fruit available in the lobby all day.   It is definitely a leisure hotel.  The service was very friendly| but we were staying with a car which was valet parked by the hotel.  The hotel promises that you will have your car within 20 - 30 minutes| however| we had to wait a full hour on one of the days.  The elevators are really slow| and we chose to take the stairs most of the time because the wait was just too long.  This hotel would not be a good place to stay if you are in a rush to get places.   It wasn't all that clean.  The toilet in the room had old urine…,
6,Perfect NYC Home Base,We stayed here recently with our boys| 8 and 10. I wasn't immediately impressed with the hotel but it won me over on all levels pretty quickly. Contrary to what I'd read elsewhere| not all rooms have balconies; our did not. This| although a little disappointing at first| didn't really bother me and we saved by booking a non-balcony room. The room was clean| comfortable and spacious. I had read another guest's comment prior to arriving about the glass in the bathroom door. It is just transparent enough that you don't feel like you've got complete privacy in there. A bit weird but hey| we're all family! We were on the second floor and it was very convenient to use the stairs instead of waiting for the elevator.  One of my favorite things is the free breakfast in the lobby. I don't…,
3,Always our go to place,We just recently stayed at Hotel Giraffe in NYC.  We had previously stayed at their other location uptown| Hotel Elyse| so we thought we'd give Hotel Giraffe a try since it is closer to where our daughter lives.  You can't get any better than these hotels.  The service is 1st class| the accommodations are 1st class and the staff is so pleasant.  You feel so valued at Hotel Giraffe. As far as prices go| they are not the most expensive| but after you experience the service| you will believe you are staying in the most expensive hotel in Manhattan.  The best part| they are a small chain of hotels (I believe 4 of them)| and that to me is so important.   We will return Hotel Giraffe| and we will look forward to our next return!,
98,Lovely|handy|comfy|Manhattan boutique hotel.,Myself| my wife and our two teenage kids|16 and 13| stayed at the Giraffe| twice| on our two weeks trip to the States. The Hotel is well located for the Manhattan sights; we walked a lot and also used the nearby subways. The hotel is really clean and relatively modern. The room| a two double bed with balcony| was great. The bathroom was large and well equipped; the beds were large and comfortable. The hotel staff were marvellous| the reception staff were all friendly and very helpful with info re trips and shows etc. The continental breakfast was lovely| fresh bagels and pastries| fruit and cereals. The free cheese and wine in the evenings was fab| just right to set you up for a night out. The house keeping was exceptional| clean towels morning and night. All in all a really…,
14,Hotel Giraffe - Fantastic,What a great Hotel.  Stayed here for nine nights in August| 2013.  We stayed in a King suite with a small balcony on the 8th floor.  Very roomy and comfortable with very little or no street noise.  Breakfast| all day coffee and evening wine and cheese all complimentary.  Midtown located with a short walk to the Subway and many restaurants in near proximity.  Extremely nice to come back too at the end of the day.  Without hesitation we will come back/recommend.,
1,Raving about your hotel!,We have not stopped recommending your hotel to our family & friends since we came home! We stayed in July (2 adults| 2 teenage children) and your hotel offered everything we wanted - and more! Our rooms were spacious and comfortable and the extras offered| at no extra cost (eg. comfort pillows| comfort mattress| empty mini fridge etc) made them even better. The staff were helpful and friendly and very kindly delivered a bottle of wine to our room to mark our wedding anniversary. The lobby was bright and clean| breakfast was delicious (a lovely fresh fruit salad| fresh pastries| bagels etc) and an excellent range of teas and coffee to suit every taste And we loved the early evening wine and cheese reception! The hotel contributed to our fabulous holiday just as much as the…,
34,Five great days stay!,Stayed at the Giraffe for five great days in July| can't praise the place highly enough !!! Probably the best boutique hotel we've stayed in anywhere on our journeys around the world - staff excellent and friendly| breakfast very good and staff really on the ball| rooms very nice. Hotel is situated in a great spot for exploring NY| with added bonus of free wine and nibbles every evening! Will stay there again when in NYC .,
2,Excellent Hotel!,My family and I just spent four days at the Hotel Giraffe and were very impressed by it. The staff were all attentive and excellent. The room was really nice and very comfortable. The free breakfast and the Happy Hour wine and snacks were great in the evening. Perfect way to end a full day of sightseeing in New York City. The location of the hotel is also very good. Walking distance to a lot of attractions and great shopping. Can't wait to go back!!!!!!!!,
137,Fantastic Hotel,We love hotel Giraffe. If you want a very clean| modern hotel with large bedrooms| this is for you  As a family of four we had two double beds| the rooms are very spacious and the rate included breakfast and evening cheese and wine. The location is very good| a short walk to Eataly our favorite Italian restaurants.  We stayed here for 3 nights| followed two weeks later for 3 nights at The Jade Hotel in Greenwich Village. No contest| no hesitation in recommending for value| comfort and friendliness.,
459,Great location,My two teenagers and I stayed 13 nights at the Hotel Giraffe this summer while my daughter attended a summer dance camp. It was very convenient with two teenagers that breakfast is included as well as afternoon snacks. Before our arrival| I also requested a mini fridge for the room which was a great addition at no charge. The hotel is in a great location just two blocks from the 6 Subway or a short walk to Madison Square Park for the N/R which will take you to Times Square. We used the N/R a number of times to attend several Broadway shows and the 6 to go to Yankees Stadium for a game. A Shake Shack location is in Madison Square Park so you can grab a shake on your walk back! Another great teenage eatery was by Madison Square Park: Schnipper's. An OK deli (Cafe CNN) is a few…,
122,Fantastic boutique hotel,Best hotel ever in NY. Nice| tidy rooms. Enough space. Excellent service 24/7 Always helpful staff at front desk| helped out with everything. Breakfast included| really nice. Wine and cheese in the evening. Drink| fruit| cakes 24/7 all complimentary.,
3,A home away from home,"Hotel Giraffe is all we hope for in a hotel; welcoming and serviceminded as well as with a stylish interior. It is such a ""civilized"" place! We will definitevely stay there next time we visit New York.",
56,Lovely!!,This is a great boutique hotel.  The rooms were excellent (though honestly not as nice as the Library| which hold through the 'theme' approach better) -- extremely clean and spacious. The staff was great| bringing us a free bottle of wine for my friend's birthday. The value-add's are terrific -- cookies| water & coffee/tea all day (including cappucino!); wine & cheese in the evenings; a very complete breakfast in the mornings. I loved the wine & cheese| and the breakfast is continental super-plus -- there was cereal| fruit| yogurt| bagels| toast| hard boiled eggs| and coffee/tea.  Fantastic service and the lobby is lovely.  Overall can't say enough nice things!,
112,It was OK,Booked the hotel based on excellent reviews like your previous reviewer; same balcony problem  - or lack of - not even mentioned at checkin. We were allocated 3rd floor; no balcony; very dark lounge facing internal walls which frankly you would not want to spend a lot of time in. Friends staying on floor 7 had the sort of airy suite we expected. Elegant| ours was not and because we were on a low floor there was a bit of street noise in the bedroom at night.  I have stayed all over NYC and I do prefer the quieter areas and this fitted the bill altho the nearest subway was a bit of a walk. The hotel staff were excellent and I could not have asked for more as my daughters got ready for older daughter's wedding in our suite. The lobby is light and airy as per the photo and breakfast…,
27,Everything a hotel ought to. Be.,The Hotel Giraffe is everything a hotel ought to be. My expectations may be modest| but few hotels measure up. I want a great location (in this case midtown); a welcoming place (great staff); a comfy bed; a clean room; a place to put my toothbrush| cosmetics| and suitcase; room to walk around the bed; a balcony from which to check the weather; and a sense that they appreciate my business. That's all. But the Giraffe offers more: a great breakfast| interesting people watching| coffee and cookies whenever I want| wine and tasty tidbits from 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm| and chocolates on the pillow. Did I mention a great cappuccino whenever I want it? Yes| I love this hotel and hope to go back.,
9,So I think I would have to say average,I was really excited to stay here as a result of the glowing reviews on TA.  My husband and I and our two teen aged sons (14 and 16) were in Cooperstown for a day then in NYC for 2 days.  I had booked a 2 double bed + balcony.  Once we got to the room| no balcony.  Simple enough.  Went downstairs to have this corrected and evidently the room we were originally assigned had a problem so we were downgraded to a room without a balcony.  No communication of this at check in.  I will say the problem was ultimately corrected| with  very bad communication| so I am putting that to the side.  However| at a 5 star hotel I would expect much better in dealing with a problem such as this.  Location - 20 minute walk to most things which is more than I would do next time with my kids.  We…,
3,Gracious and Gorgeous,Our stay was simply lovely.  Where to begin?  The rooms are elegant and comfortable.  The breakfast each morning includes delicious pastries and a latte that is perfection.  What makes this hotel a standout is the staff.  I noticed that all guests are treated like good friends| warm smiles and conversation are constant.  Some guests who are regulars were greeted with hugs. This hotel is a rare gem.  We will be back. Thank you to all of the Hotel Giraffe staff.,
111,We won't stay anywhere else in the future!,We loved our five days at Hotel Giraffe - the place has a homely charm| which even appealed to us on our arrival at 1am!  We were travelling with our two children and booked two rooms (1105 and 1106). These two rooms interconnected via a lounge and so| we had our own New York Apartment for a few days! Both rooms had balconies and we were able to watch the NYC traffic storm up Park Avenue 24 hours a day.   Great complimentary breakfast and coffee in the lobby and cheese afternoon is a nice touch too. We love you Hotel Giraffe and will see you again soon!,
12,good view,the hotel location really nice and vey close to everything.rooms comfortable and quite.really nice staff they were great|the hotel breakfast really good.in the evening you can have a beer .highly reccomended to others,
106,Could not have been more pleased,From our bags unobtrusively taken from our cab upon arrival  to my wife's coin purse full of hundreds of dollars being found and returned| we were most impressed with this hotel.    The location| the friendliness of the staff| the comp breakfast and afternoon wine/cheese| the ambiance of our room with built in drawers| the comfy bed - all makes this hotel a notch above and an excellent value.  We've found the NYC hotel to return to!,
94,Great location with a balcony!,My husband and I just stayed here with our two kids. The hotel is in an excellent location a block from Madison Square (where there's a Shake Shack)| MoMath| Eataly| and it's a short walk to Union Square. It's not cheap| but it's worth the extra money if you can swing it.  We had a suite with a sleeper sofa so we could stay in the bedroom and the kids could have the living room. The best part of the room was the balcony. We could see Grand Central and Union Square. The room size was decent. The only thing we didn't like was the glass window on the bathroom door (why do that?).   The hotel offers complimentary breakfast| which is nice: pastries| oatmeal| yogurt| fruit and an espresso machine. There aren't enough places to sit in the lobby| but that's not the end of the world.…,
191,Small and friendly escape from the hustle of the city,Lovely warm welcome each and every time we entered or left the hotel. Felt very personal and inviting which was lovely. Room was large enough for the family of 4 (sharing two doubles) for a 3 night stay. Never made the complementary cheese and wine in the early evenings| but the free continental breakfast meant one less decision in a morning. Central enough for everything we wanted. Would recommend.,
228,Great Value| Nice Place to Stay,This is fantastic boutique hotel option and has to be one of the best values ever in NYC.  I’m sure you’ve already read about all the inclusions – cold breakfast| wine and nibbles| free wifi| bathrobes| turndown| minibar| 1 pm check out.  They do have gym but will provide passes to nearby club.  We stayed in a one-bedroom balcony suite w/ sofabed for kids.  You’ll need to call the hotel directly to book w/ more than one child.  Ashley from front desk was so friendly when I phoned that I literally felt obligated to stay (and they wisely value Trip Advisor people).  The best part of the hotel for us was the lobby area which has numerous chairs| tables and sofas.  It is very cozy and welcoming.  My boys played chess and I enjoyed the wine.    The suite was clean and in good…,
17,Great location| not that impressed as others were,Good hotel| great location| Nice touch with the daily drinks and snacks (actually quite ok wine served during those hours| fine rooms| but other than that| not so much impressed with it as others were. Just a good hotel| nothing more,
86,Can't wait to return!,from arrival to departure this hotel had us completely spoiled!  we hated to leave after spending 6 nights in a king suite with a balcony......cant wait to return....from now on every trip to NY we will be staying at the Hotel Giraffe....perfect location| happy professional staff| clean comfortable rooms| best complimentary breakfast in town.....and the evening wine and snacks were beautiful....the rooftop terrace was used and appreciated by us everyday ....my only suggestion is....dont worry about which floor u are on....all views are the same....we were on the 11th floor...but would have been happy with any floor.....and once the balcony doors were closed...NO SOUNDS from outdoors could be heard.....,
1,Loved the Hotel Giraffe,We had a wonderful experience and stay at this hotel! The hotel and decor is lovely| clean and in a great location| the rooms were quiet| meticulous and comfortable. The staff could not be more friendly| helpful and accommodating and most of all| we loved generous the hotel is. They offered a lovely breakfast each morning which included Cappucino and croissants... as well as a wonderful and relaxing wine and cheese in the afternoons. It was so relaxing and delicious. There is also a rooftop bar| though we never made it there| it sounded great. We absolutely loved our stay and intend to book it again in the future!,
2,Exceededs all expectations,I just returned from a trip to New York with my family (we are four adults). We stayed at Hotel Giraffe on 26th and Park Avenue - which was a perfect location as first-timers in New York. Central - yet a bit away from the piles of tourists at the Times Square area.   We had pre-booked a Double Queen room at Hotel Giraffe| and requested to get a high floor with a french balcony for a good city-view. We booked this hotel well-knowing it wasn't the Waldorf or the Plaza - but this looked like a low key| nice and cosy place - perfect for us - and it was!  When the taxi pulled up at the entrance| we where met by a friendly member of staff| who instantly took our four big pieces of luggage off our hands| so we were free to go check-in. The reception staff were all smiles and gave us a…,
53,So pleasant,This hotel is very good in many aspects.  Location is great| staff was always very nice| room was big and comfortable| shower was good| free wifi and breakfast... Everything you've read here on TripAdvisor is true and I'll not add more.  One nice thing is that their check-out time is at 1pm| while most of the hotels are at 11am. This is great as you don't need to rush in your last day in the city and can sleep more (bed is great) -- if you don't have a flight early in the morning| of course.  I was a little bit sad to leave this hotel and will definitely come back the next time I'm in New York.,
29,True Gem of the City!,From arrival to departure everything about this hotel was wonderful.  Starting off each day with a complimentary breakfast was wonderful.  The wine reception in the evening was great after a busy touring day to relax before changing and heading out for the evening.  The hotel is very small| but had everything we needed.  We splurged for a King Suite| it was on the 4th floor and was wonderful.  It was bigger than I had expected it to be (knowing the rooms in Manhattan are small).  The staff was always friendly and helpful| even the maid service| that always seemed to want to clean our room when we stopped back in were very patient and came back when we had left.  The location couldn't have been better.  We commuted by walking| cab| town car and subways.  And it was easy to get…,
183,A Hotel With a great location,We stayed 21 days at this hotel in July 2013 and we couldn´t have chosen a better hotel given location. We really wanted to get to know the city and walked everywhere from our hotel| it was easy. The area has lot of great coffeshops and restaurants so if we did not want to walk to far an evening it was just to pick something close. The staff was very friendly and service minded but given that we stayed 21 days| we thought we would get to know them a little more. The rooms is nice and the balcony is really nice. Housekeeping & turndown service was offered every day/evening. Every morning there was free breakfast which was very nice. Coffee (latte| cappuccino| etc.) were available throughout the day as well as cakes.. Every evening between 17:00 to 20:00| we were served wine and…,
3,Great hotel!,"My sister and I stayed Hotel Giraffe for 4 nights and loved it! We have stayed in numerous hotels in NY and this was our favourite by a country mile. The room was big and comfy| each and every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful and lets just say we made the most of ""Cheese and Wine Hour"".    I stupidly picked up the wrong suitcase at JFK and had to return to the airport the day we arrived. A really lovely young guy (blonde hair| sorry can't remember the name) at reception arranged for a town car for us at a good discount and on our return (when we were too hot and a bit worse for wear)| arranged for a bottle of wine to be sent to our room. It was such a lovely gesture after a pretty rubbish afternoon| we were very touched.   We have stayed at a similarly priced…",
2,Excellent,The staff could not have been nicer or the accomadations more pleasant.  The evening refreshments and the beautiful breakfast were not only convienant but also delicous and served with a smile. The rooms had everything (frig| ironing board| shower| tub| Iphone charger etc.) with big comfortable beds.  We called it our oasis in the city.,
33,Amazing hospitality,We stayed four nights at Giraffe.  From the first moment| this hotel and its excellent staff more than lived up to expectations which Trip Advisor reviews had already set at a very high level.  We were looked after marvellously from the moment we arrived.  We became very fond of the lobby area and the rooftop terrace; the breakfast was especially good (my son and I cannot have gluten| it was a pleasure to go somewhere which so willingly provides gluten free alternatives) and we enjoyed what was regrettably our only visit to the nightly cheese and wine reception. Some friends at Hotel Mela came to visit| they left very jealous.  Hats off to Chris at the reception desk whose good advice helped us make the best of our days and to Ana who looked after us at breakfast.,
81,Great Spot in NYC,I loved my stay at this charming hotel. My adult son joined me (we were visiting another son who lived in the city) and we all really liked Hotel Giraffe. Its location is really convenient with lots to do within walking distance. Our king suite was great for 2 of us with a comfortable pull out sofa. The free breakfast was perfect with such nice service and I loved the afternoon happy hour. David at the front desk was so nice and helpful~ suggesting nearby restaurants and getting us show tickets. I have already booked two more stays to visit my son.I think this hotel is a real find in a city with lots of properties.,
28,A slice of New York,We have stayed at 3 of the Library collection hotels and so far Giraffe is the best. Professionalism and friendliness extended across all members of the staff| from checking in with Mike| Chris giving us our very early morning gym passes thru to the wonderful staff at breakfast as well as at the cheese and wine reception. Selection and quality of breakfast goods is excellent. Location of this hotel is perfect| away from the chaos of Times Square but still central to many attractions| activities and restaurants. On booking we requested a quiet room which we got on the 11th floor and 23rd street side - hard to believe we were in the heart of the city as it was so quiet. Our suite was perfectly ample and maintained to a high standard. We're already planning 'Giraffe revisited' in…,
3,Great place to stay in NYC,"- Efficient & Courteous Staff - thank you for the laptop in the piano bar  - I've stayed here before and will do so again   minor quibble  - for the first time I treated myself to 'limo pick-up at the airport"" ( an option at the time of reservation).  appears this is subcontracted out| and at 2 am my 'driver' actually put the airport luggage cart on the escalator ... bad idea and leave it at that (grin).  Next time| city cab for Andrew Cheers|",
1,Playful perfection at Hotel Giraffe,With two daughters and their husbands living in NYC| I've tried out several hotels on visits to NYC| but none compares with Hotel Giraffe. My stay in July 2013 for one of their weddings was letter perfect: the staff could not have been more friendly or accommodating| fetching extra chairs| etc.| for pre-wedding makeup. The quality of the (free!) food available in the lobby 24/7 was topnotch--loved the copious fresh fruit at breakfast and the multi-talented coffee drinks machine. The rooms were comfortable and well equipped| down to an excellent selection of well chosen books. The excellent housekeeping staff kept things in order. At the last minute| we changed the rehearsal dinner to the hotel restaurant| Bread & Tulips| and we were thrilled with the excellent service and…,
17,Wonderful Hotel,Just returned from a delightful one week stay at Hotel Giraffe. The rooms were spacious| very clean with plenty of light| and with all the amenities one would need. The service was perfect. The front desk staff were friendly| very helpful and very efficient. We arrived to hotel at 1:00 AM and were in the room five minutes later. The breakfast could have been better with more variety| but can't complain since it was complimentary. The wine and cheese in the evening was a nice treat| after a long day exploring the city. The location couldn't have been better| right next to two subway lines| around the corner from a lovely park (with the best milk shakes in town)| and good restaurants within blocks of the hotel. I felt safe returning to the hotel| even late at night.  I would…,
18,Perfect stay-our first to New York,Seeing this hotel in 'New York| I love you' reminded me I had never quite got around to writing a review on our short break in March!  We chose to stay here thanks to the TA accolades besides we found for a similar rate we qualified for a suite opposed to a room elsewhere (a bedroom with a lounge area which converted into a second room for our boys) with a plentiful and fresh continental breakfast with a fabulous cheese and wine session from 5-8pm throw in!  Arriving late afternoon we opted for room service which was fresh and plentiful-the portions were very generous and we could almost have done with ordering less.  Hotel had a relaxed| low-key vibe| staff were pleasant and helpful| great welcome at the door.  We much prefer smaller boutique hotels so this was just perfect for…,
1,Like home in the middle of NYC,We recently stayed for 8 nights| then stayed at another hotel for 8 and returned to the Giraffe for our final two nights because we missed it! Excellent staff| very friendly| complimentary continental breakfast and wine and cheese in early evening.  Enjoyed the rooftop deck after long hot days| the small deck off the room and great location near Flatiron district and Chelsea.  Could also walk up to Times Square and loved the great shopping on Broadway below 23rd.  An excellent stay| would definitely return!  Thanks to all the great staff who made us feel so welcome and comfortable!,
1,Appreciated the extras,As a family of four (two adults| two children - ages 7 and 5)| we stayed in a suite for two nights in June. We took advantage of the food offered in the lounge and the discount at next-door restaurant Bread & Tulips. Having Sarabeth's on the same block was an unanticipated benefit -- we were able to meet up with a large number of NYC-based friends for brunch. The only reason I am not giving an excellent rating is the sofa bed. It was so soft that it seemed like it had permanent depressions from where previous guests had slept. Despite this one point of dissatisfaction| we would certainly choose this hotel again. As mentioned in other reviews| the staff deserve a shout-out for being professional and engaged.,
11,Quality Hotel Stay,This is the second hotel in this chain that I have used.  First was the Library and now the Giraffe.  Super places with great attention to detail.  The happy hour is done well with good wine and some fine treats.  Room comes with everything you could want and the shower was great.  Would definitely stay at any of the sister hotels.,
59,All the nice touches were touching,"We like off-the-beaten-path boutique hotels rather than the massive chains| and this hotel exemplifies why. The service here| from the front desk staff to the bellmen to the housekeepers| was uniformly excellent. They all clearly want you to enjoy your stay| and they succeed in helping you do so.   There always something to nibble on or sip from at the lobby bar/service area.  The items available at the ""continental breakfast"" are numerous and good; much better than at most such offerings. In the afternoon| have a little wine and cheese| and maybe a little bubbly. It's there for your pleasure| and we were pleased.  The room was clean and comfortable. Not particularly spacious (and we had a ""suite"") but hey| this is NYC. Our first night we were in a bit of a panic because the bed…",
11,Great hotel,Our stay was perfect. The location of the hotel is great. To blocks away from the subway. The huge for NYC. The price was reasonable and the staff was friendly and helpful. We will definitely be returning on our next trip to the city. ,
420,A Oasis in Manhattan,Stayed in a suite for five days with my wife at the end of June.  My wife had stayed before on business trips.  I was unfamiliar with the neighborhood but had walked by the hotel before while strolling down Park Ave. This is a great| small hotel and very well-priced for New York.   First| the staff are all first rate – from the guys on the door to the desk staff to housekeeping and room service.  Friendly| professional and always helpful.  The front desk helped us arrange cars| theater tickets| airport transportation| dinner reservations| etc.  They treat you the way you want and expect to be treated.  Again| simply great.   Second| while our suite was not large – a sitting room| bed room and bath – it was very comfortable and in good Shape.  The sitting room window looked out…,
28,You won't go wrong staying here.,Great little hotel.  This was our first trip to New York .   We almost booked a hotel over near Time Square but were so glad we didn't when we saw the volume of tourists .   It was a relief to  come back to this hotel (away from the noisy tourists) in the evening and have a glass of wine in the lobby before heading back out for dinner.  Room was very clean and quiet at night. Beds were good| a little firm which is the way I like them. Great shower. Good counters space in the bathroom as well as in the room.  A couple of blocks  walk through the lovely Madison Square Park to the subway. Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.,
41,Lovely Contemporary Hotel,The hotel Giraffe is a wonderful botique hotel in the heart of Park Avenue New York.  The rooms are well appointed and spacious and the balcony is a nice way to get a feel for the heart of New York.  The breakfast is ample and coffee good.  The wine and cheese in the early evening is a nice way to unwind as you plan your evening. . The roof top bar was also a great place to have a nice drink and take in the city The staff are freindly and professional.  The Giraffe was a great place to stay and I would highly recomend it if you want a great botique hotel in the heart of New York.,
10,280,Another great review for the Giraffe!,We just returned from a 7 day stay at the Hotel Giraffe and loved every moment!  This hotel is very conveniently located just a couple of blocks from major subway connections and a 3 min. walk away from beautiful Madison Square Park and the Shake Shack!    The rooms were large| extremely clean| and comfortable.  The shower had great water pressure and consistent water temperature.  Returning to the room after a long day and evening to soft music and chocolate on the pillows was a great touch.  We also enjoyed the breakfast| wine and cheese| and cookies and coffee in the lobby.  We will most definitely be back!
47,Thank you for Treating Like a Princess,I stayed here last summer and fell bad for not writing review.  I was very happy with my room which had balcony that I never had at any hotels in NYC.  The room was so beautifully decorated and had plenty of desk space to work.  I enjoyed the facilities and the check in staff was the friendliest I have ever encountered and treated me as if I was celebrity.   I was treated with profound respect and was asked if I needed anything| but all I needed was there| but it was nice to know how much they cared to ensure my stay was pleasent.  Stay there and get surprised|  This property is far superior of that of Library which was OK even though I gave it 5 stars and Casablanca where I had unfortunate experience which could have been rectified like all other hotels do in NYC.  Hotel…,
229,Sweet deal in NYC,This hotel in conveniently located on Park Ave. Rooms are clean and nicely sized for NYC. We had trouble closing the window treatments| but that was the only problem with our balconied room. Included with your room are wine and snacks in the evening and a quite adequete breakfast. The hotel also has a nice roof bar.,
68,beautiful| comfortable| accomodating,Everything about the Hotel Giraffe is beautiful and comfortable. There is no pretension here. The lobby was a great place for relaxing and working. The wine and cheese reception was perfect way to unwind at the end of the day. It was also very nice to return to such a comfortable| clean| quiet room. The turn down service was a nice touch. The staff here were all absolutely fabulous and accommodating to all of our needs and requests| including helping myself and my colleagues finish up some work we were doing very late on night in the lobby. Great location too with plenty of places to eat nearby| close to transportation.,
20,Convenient and Friendly Manhattan Hotel,We stayed here for six nights in late June.  We had a two room suite| with two parents in the bedroom and two kids on a pull out couch.  The room was clean and| by Manhattan standards| fairly spacious.  The complimentary breakfast in the morning helps take some of the financial sting off a family vacation in Manhattan| and the wine and cheese from 5:00 p.m. until 8:30 p.m. can help tide you over until dinner.  There are also cookies available in the lobby 24/7| which is a nice touch.  There are only two elevators| and it seems like one or both are often being used by the staff| so you may end up waiting a bit to change floors.  A metro station for the 6 line is just two blocks away| and the N and R lines are just five blocks away| making it very convenient for metro travel.  A…,
10,We Love The Giraffe!,This is our fifth stay at the Giraffe.  Couldn't be happier with the rooms| amenities and location. There are many more posh hotels to stay in New York| the Mandarin Oriental| Four Seasons etc. but at this price point| the Giraffe is hard to beat.  Great breakfast in the lobby with wine and cheese in the afternoon. Rooms are modern and clean| bed comfortable and internet available in the room. Subway is two blocks and Union Square is a brief walk. Can't wait to go back.,
29,Fantastic Giraffe Hotel,We liked everything about the Hotel| starting with the friendly and really helpful staff. The room was beautiful| spotlessly clean and assiduously maintained throughout our stay. I could not say enough good things about the housekeeping staff| they were marvellous. The atmosphere in the Giraffe Hotel is relaxed and the girls who oversaw the breakfast were lovely and very helpful. The breakfast itself was also lovely| a good variety of fresh fruit and juices| assorted breads and pastries| and lovely boiled eggs with white shells. The idea of the Cheese and Wine in the evening is a lovely one| not just because it is free| but because it creates a really convivial atmosphere in the Hotel Lobby| with people chatting| playing cards| reading and listening to lovely piano music. We…,
25,GIRAFFE,I stayed at the hotel a few years ago and my general impression has been of a clean - central - hotel - I was there for business and I could reach the places I need in a few minutes walk. I greatly reccomend the hotel both for a leisure travel or for business. The rooms are clean as well as the bathroom. In the room you also have the possibility to iron yourself the clothes . And the bar is just perfect to have a coffee or a drink .,
1,I like,Not my all time fave but very nice. We stayed in king suite. The decor could be freshened a bit. The balcony is really cool. The room was a bit smaller than expected. The staff was excellent. Kind of a drag you can't get a drink on the roof patio until 5pm and that it's closed on Sunday.That's all right.,
14,A True Gem in NYC,This hotel is a real find - great little boutique at a terrific price in the heart of NYC. Our room was a comfortable size; we had a King suite and yes| the bathroom was a bit small for 3 of us| but hey it's New York! The lobby and amenities are especially nice. We enjoyed the wine and cheese in the late afternoons and the breakfast in the mornings - very nice selection and the staff members were all extremely accommodating. The rooftop bar is another plus. This is our new number one hotel for all visits to NYC.,
7,Excellent choice| would stay again!,Just home from a 4 night stay in the Giraffe| lovely boutique Hotel well situated where Staff very friendly and efficient. Quite a small hotel with only 12 floors| the 12th being a roof top bar which is set out in a Mediterranean fashion with plants| pots etc. stayed in a corner suite on the 10th floor 1006- with balcony overlooking Park Ave| room was clean and spacious with lots of natural light. Wine and cheese served every evening between 5-8pm| wines were very good and forthcoming| coffee and tea available all day in the lobby and continental breakfast included. Small issue- I prefer something hot to a continental breakfast| so went out to eat in the mornings but plenty of places to choice from close by. Quieter location than Times Square but close to Empire State Building|…,
2,Not all the conveniences of a big hotel| but nice none the less,I booked a Classic King Suite for myself staying 4 nights| hearing that hotel rooms in Manhatten run on the small side. Even so| the suite isn't very large - but for a solo traveller| it will do.  Tea/coffee making facilities need to be requested and weren't standard in the rooms apparently. I tried to travel light and relied on the bathroom amentities provided by the hotel| they were not the quality I expected of that kind of hotel - but again| it did the job. Combined bath/shower facility.  It seems to be a nice quiet area| apart from the garbage trucks that come by somewhat regularly in the mornings. I wouldn't say it was in the heart of everything| but it wasn't far to jump on the subway to get to all the touristy places.  Biggest pain point was having room service only…,
132,Good service and rooms,We stayed first in their standard room and then in a junior suite only because the standard rooms were sold out for the last few nights.  The standard room was nice with a little tiny balcony.  Smallish bathrooms| but acceptable.  The rooms were clean| but definitely could use an upgrade with the oldish carpeting.    The junior suite had a sitting area with a couch| can sit maybe 4 people comfortably in that room with a tv.  The bedroom is the same as the standard room.  The beds were comfortable| not too soft.  The rooftop (common area) is nice.  Visit there if you're staying there.  They have free flow coffee and water in the ground floor lobby that you can take up to the roof to sip on.    The lobby acts as the breakfast area as well| which I didn't think was that nice at…,
5,Wonderful boutique hotel,Great hotel| excellent location| wonderful service. Highly recommend this small boutique hotel in midtown (?Murray Hill) Manhattan. Stayed for 2 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Would definitely use again.,
12,Nice Staff.,Not my all time fave but very nice. We stayed in king suite. The decor could be freshened a bit. The balcony is really cool. The room was a bit smaller than expected. The staff was excellent. Kind of a drag you can't get a drink on the roof patio until 5pm and that it's closed on Sunday. Overall| a nice stay.,
5,Highly recommend!,I've just returned to London after a 4 night stay here and cannot recommend it highly enough! This is my 3rd visit to New York| I've been fortunate enough to stay at the plaza before but in my opinion the hotel giraffe was far superior. Faultless service and reasonably spacious rooms for a city centre hotel. It's unusually hard to spend any additional money at this hotel as almost everything is complimentary| including great coffee available 24 hours a day. Would definitely recommend and come back myself.,
139,Great Location| everyone is more than accommodating,We stayed here 9 days.. So helpful was everyone who worked here.  Breakfast was ok and Wine and cheese was good.  The room had a couple of issues but they apologized ...Loved the location and the Rooftop was wonderful.  The value was expensive but felt secure ! Would highly recommend this hotel and happy we choose this,
73,Nice place,Stayed here for 3 nights and liked it although not sure the value for money is completely there.  The wine and cheese  in the afternoon Is nice. Breakfast is ok...ish. Could have probably had some salt like hm or cheese,
165,Relaxed and elegant,Like so many other travellers| I loved Giraffe. We arrived very early in the morning and our room was not ready (we did not expect it to be)| but were offered a cup of coffee and something to eat either in the lobby or on the roof terrace. It was actually breakfast time| but nobody asked if we had paid for an extra breakfast.   Our room turned out to be bigger than expected| very comfortable| with a tiny balcony and a big bathroom. The bed not so very big| but it was my own fault; I booked too late and could only get a queen size| so basically we got what we ordered. I liked the breakfast| which was served in the lobby: a simple choice of cereals| fruit| pastry etc. with good coffee and freshly pressed juices – Giraffe scored the highest points with me for their fresh cold…,
7,Our Favorite NYC Hotel,We just finished our 4th stay at Hotel Giraffe. We originally selected it because of proximity to our son's apartment and Tripadvisor reviews. It has exceeded expectations and we will return again. We especially appreciate the fine service| breakfast buffet and evening wine & cheese. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed. My wife and I enjoy newspapers in the AM and these are available in abundance.,
3,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,We have a favorite hotel in Chicago and were looking for a similar type of hotel in NYC. We found it in Hotel Giraffe! From the amazing staff| to the beautiful| clean rooms and the great location| this hotel has it all. The breakfast is wonderful (including their awesome coffee machine) and the wine and cheese reception was a welcome respite from our long days of walking and sight-seeing. There was a wonderful jazz club within walking distance as well as shopping and plenty of dining. We would most definitely stay there again!,
118,Well Done,Took a chance and stayed here on a recent business trip to NYC. Typically stay at the Four Seasons or the Palace| but tried the Hotel Giraffe on the recommendation of a friend. Wow...what a great stay. The staff is very| very good. They treat you so very well...they want to help and make your stay the most enjoyable possible. They were just superb.  Had a suite on the 6th floor that was clean and had a separate bedroom. Very good bed...wifi service was quick and effortless to access. Snacks available throughout the day as well as fresh fruit included in your room rate. Breakfast as well.  Superb rate and value for the money. It could be one of the best hotel rates for great value in NYC.  Did I mention location. Outstanding and close to some of the best restaurants in the city. …,
3,Great Location| Great hotel!,"What a great hotel. Excellent staff: very helpful| really go out of their way to make you feel at home. Great amenities| continental breakfast is lovely| wine and cheese from 5pm and other snacks available throughout the day and all included in your room rate.   We travelled with our 8 month old daughter and it was no trouble at all. They provided a good travel cot with blanket and a separate unfilled fridge (both of which i requested at the time of booking). We had a king room with balcony: it was spacious| well appointed| comfortable and perfectly adequate. Nowhere in NYC is ""quiet"" but the hotel is really well situated and noise is not a big issue. Our daughter slept through the night each night.  Excellent location - midtown so easy to go up towards Central Park or down…",
7,Wow,I've spent many many years in corporate hotels and decide to try something a bit different.  A good holiday starts with building a good relationship with the staff before arrival and this we most certainly did| the staff at this hotel are excellent.   On arrival we found a hotel placed in an exellent location| a relaxed atmosphere| beautiful room fully kitted to cope with all our USB needs.  Service during breaksfast and evening cheese and wine was fantastic.  Would I change anything no| would I return again YES.  Thank you Peter and the team for such a wonderful week.,
7,Great Stay,What a gem of a hotel. Wonderful staff| great location we came for the Big Apple BBQ and to visit with my son and daughter in law. It's one block from Madison Square Park the locale of the BBQ. We walked everywhere with the exception of Brooklyn that's when the staff gave us perfect directions for the subway. I will definitely stay here again and by the way the Bread and Tulips restaurant is pretty darn good give it a try.,
3,Beautiful boutique hotel,We stayed here for a long weekend in NYC.  This hotel is such a gem.  It is conveniently located| quiet and comfortable.  Loved the breakfast| wine and cheese and snacks throughout the day (all included).  The coffee is the best in the city and worth the stay all by itself.  The room is spacious| clean and also quiet.  It was such a pleasure to stay here and will be back.,
10,My new favorite hotel in New York,I was so impressed with everything about Hotel Giraffe-- the lovely light-filled lobby| the very helpful staff| the charming room with a balcony where one can sit with a perfect cup of coffee from the machine in the dining room. Everything was sparkling clean and new| and almost spa-like in the peace and quiet. I loved having wine and cheese in the afternoon| and a perfect breakfast in the morning. New York has so much to offer| but I have to admit| I was happy to just stay put and relax in this hotel.,
2,Great location| friendly staff.  Would definitely stay here again.,We stayed here the first week of June with our two children| aged 8 and 2.  We had a room with two double beds| and a balcony overlooking the corner of 26th street and Park.  Room was spacious and well appointed.  We have traveled all over the world with our kids| and this is one of the largest rooms we have had in a major city. The hotel is in a perfect location| a few blocks from Little Korea| and right around the corner from Curry Hill.  It was a short two block walk to the subway| with easy access to upper East side museums| Times Square| Grand Central etc.  There is a brilliant park about a block away with a nice play area for children and also home to the Shake Shack.  We walked to the Empire State Building| the New York Public Library| and Bryant Park.  The hotel has a…,
10,Hotel Girafffe a definite place to stay,Stayed there for a week. Great place. Between the comp'd breakfast| cookies during the day and the cheese and crackers in the afternoon (not to mention the wine)| we always had a snack available. The use of an umbrella was a real life saver. We were prepared for light rain| but the torrential downpour of last Friday would have ruined our day| if not for the umbrellas. Location was great| within 3 blocks of 5 different subway lines (N|R|4|5 & 6). Not much really close by as far as reasonably prices restaurants| but there were a few within a 10 minute walk on Lex & 5th (btwn 23 & 28th). My wife & I took our recent HS grad. The corner suite (bedroom| living room with pull out) provided all of us with some degree of privacy at a reasonable price (for MidTown). Staff was great|…,
212,Delightful Hotel,Stayed here with some friends and really enjoyed the staff and room. Wine and cheese hour is nice after a long day (the only free thing in NYC haha) and the breakfast is a nice bonus too. Its in a quiet area which was nice for winding down after a long day and felt more like home than the big box hotels.,
1,Phenomenal hotel and location!,"Family of 4 (2 teenage daughters).   Stayed at the Giraffe for 7 nites in late May.  We were welcomed upon arrival with a very helpful staff and pleasantly surprised to find our room was available for check in at 8am.  Perfect after a ""red-eye"" from So Cal!  This allowed us to freshen up and get on with our exploring of Manhattan.   The boutique hotel is perfectly situated in Midtown a couple blocks from Flatiron District which I found to enjoy the most.  A block from Madison Square Park as well.  Another major benefit we loved was being on Park Ave and directly above the 4|5|6 subway line.  Made it extremely easy to traverse all of Manhattan.    Hotel staff was top notch and very accommodating.  I travel a lot and I cannot recall a better staff.  2 double bed room with balcony…",
19,New favourite hotel in NYC| period.,We have been to the city many times| but this was our first trip with our 9 year old. Booked 2 nights mid-week in a King Suite. Staff were friendly and incredibly helpful| even with our silly questions about how to take the subway to Brooklyn for a concert at the Barclays Center. Rooms are bright| comfortable| clean and spacious| and the balcony (really| a ledge) was a wonderful touch (fresh air in a hotel room!). Can't wait to come back.,
42,Hotel Giraffe and Library. Balcony Suite,One of our favorite of the best of NY. Great Location - Madison Avenue. Great Staff who give top flight service. Some little things wrong| but do not let it intefere with enjoying time in the room/suite| the hotel or NYC.,
33,What a great hotel,We stayed mainly because of the reviews. We are glad we did. The most important thing about a hotel is cleanliness - and this is a clean hotel. It also benefits from staff who know what they are doing and happy to help| being well appointed and comfortable and in a great position. I also thought it was a reasonable price considering.   Ok it is not the biggest hotel in the world but small really is beautiful. The nice touches are the cheese and wine which is help yourself| and the wine was pretty good. Breakfast| well OK its not the international standard of scrambled eggs etc but actually the fresh fruit and bagels and toast were very adequate. The coffee machine runs 24/7 and help yourself| which we used all the time.  We loved it and would use this hotel again when next in…,
50,A well located| comfortable hotel,We went with the Giraffe having decided we would only stay at one of the 4 hotels in the Library group in Manhattan. Based on the reviews here and their website| we were not at all disappointed and everything met our expectations. The service was excellent| the rooms large and clean (for Manhattan - we had a balcony on 10th floor)| located in a good area with Subway a block away and excellent restaurants. The wine and cheese evenings were a great bonus| as was the free and plentiful continental breakfast. My only one small comment around 'areas for improvement' relates to tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms - it took some days for us to get a coffee machine. We would definitely use Giraffe again and recommend them.,
20,comfortable and well located,we had a very comfortable stay here for a week in April. Rooms were spacious and well appointed. The hotel staff were friendly and welcoming| and the early evening cheese & wine was a nice touch. Breakfast was very nice but there was not usually quite enough seating - I wondered why they didn't  use the restaurant facilities on the floor below. We were fascinated to discover that the hotel was opposite the house where Herman Melville wrote Billy Budd and around the corner from the Armoury - home of the famous 1913 art show. A great hotel which we'd happily recommend and would visit again| in a really interesting location.,
1,Love this place,Stayed at the Giraffe for a weekend and loved it. The staff was great- very attentive and remembered my name. The constant availability of water| snacks and wine/cheese at night was a great touch. The rooms were large by NYC standards as was the bathroom- beautifully appointed as well. Would stay here again,
140,Hotel Giraffe is a great find.,Reading reviews on Trip Advisor always helps| especially with the many choices in New York City.   We have stayed at various accommodations and Hotel Giraffe is right in the pocket of a great stay. This time it was a long weekend with our friends. Upon arrival my husband joked with the front desk about this being our first time to the hotel| and the front desk man sent both our friends and ourselves a bottle of wine to our rooms. Great way to start!  Check in was efficient and rewarding!  The rooms were spotless| a fairly large space and we got the room with the balcony which was very nice| although we did experience some street noise. This really didn't bother us| but for light sleepers you may want to get a room without the balcony.Beds have firm but comfortable mattresses. My…,
45,Hotel Giraffe - Love it here!,With so many choices in NYC| I'm going to make it east for you:  Stay here.  Located on Park Ave S its a centrally located hotel convenient for Up| Mid and Lower Manhattan. With approx 100 rooms the hotel is small enough to maintain a high level of personal service yet has the feel of a high-end hotel.. In fact this is a high end hotel - the staff are engaging and more that willing to help.  The hotel has a great feel about it - rooms are larger than average - most with a usable balcony.  A roof top bar opens at 5 and provides a great start to an evening on the town - a 24 hr free refreshment bar in the lobby is also a nice touch.    So  - ignore the daft name for the place and get booking - you will not be disappointed.,
1,Perfect accommodations,We spent a long weekend at the hotel. Perfect choice. Very clean| attentive staff and nice surroundings. Convenient location -- 2 blocks from subway| close to Madison Square Park and many restaurants. Top of my list now for future visits to NYC.,
9,A Gem,"Friendly staff| great location| clean hotel.  Understated| classy but not bling bling. We came for my mother's birthday| and the staff placed us in the two rooms on the 12th floor with direct access to the roof terrace. A very relaxing stay of five nights with easy walking access to Union Square| Madison Square Park and the shops of 34th street. The air-con works fine| but the key cards get easily demagnetized| so make sure to place them in a pocket away from a cell phone. I cannot underline enough the ""people"" aspect of the staff- everyone seemed to enjoy their job and made us feel very welcome.  All in all| a very nice hotel. I will stay here again.",
10,Loved It!,This hotel is located in a great neighborhood with many interesting restaurants within walking distance. The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful and the hotel itself is spotless. We had a balcony king suite that was very spacious and comfortable. It’s a short| inexpensive cab ride to the theaters. We stayed in a sister property| Casa Blanca| last year| and we actually preferred this property over that one. The rooms are bigger and we just enjoyed the location more. You really can’t go wrong here!,
2,posh place,visiting new york for the first time is awesome and staying in this hotel made it even more memorable. We had a great stay here|so comfortable. Staff was effiecient. Good location too. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and realtives.,
226,Would love to go back right now,We just spent 3 nights in this hotel for my 40th birthday. This is the 5th hotel I've tried in NYC and it was by far the best.  We checked into our king room to find a bottle of wine and birthday note. Very nice touch. The room & bathroom were a good size| especially for NYC. I loved that I had not only a counter in the bath| but a little shelf as well. I could spread out without feeling cramped. The beds are a bit harder than I like or have noticed in other hotels. I asked for the mattress topper they offer and it made all the difference in the world. It made the bed very comfortable. The closet was also a great size. I could hang up all my clothes and put my suitcase in it with room to spare.  I was worried about the traffic noise (we were on the 8th floor) but I really didn't…,
75,Great hotel,Great location| good value for money| very friendly staff and the complimentary continental breakfast each morning was great.  Loved the complimentary wine and cheese each evening and they didn't stint.  Staff very knowledgeable and found that a great help.,
30,Small hotel well positioned with nice touches,We stayed in this well positioned hotel during a very cold five nights in January| so we needed a good base to head home to. The Hotel Giraffe gave us a great starting point to explore the city. We did a lot of walking and took the subway around so easy access. What is also so great about this place is the nice little touches you get without a bit price tag. We liked having a simple breakfast in the foyer each morning| then having a glass of wine and some nibbles when we returned. We liked that fact it was a small hotel with friendly staff. The rooms were excellent| roomy| clean comfortable with everything you needed. We were there with our teenaged daughters who were equally impressed. Can't fault this establishment| and for the money it's well worthwhile.,
187,Excellent| friendly hotel,We were made to feel very welcome at the hotel and all the staff were friendly and accommodating.  A particular mention to Jayla who was witness for our low key wedding ceremony and also to the lovely ladies who run the refreshments counter.  We enjoyed our king suite with balcony and all the amenities mentioned by others such as the evening wine and cheese| free wi-fi and breakfast. These are the things that make the hotel overall good value for money (not cheap though!). Good location and yes|it is noisy but I cannot imagine how you can get a quiet hotel and still be in the main areas of NYC. It did not disturb us very much and the hotel has a range of measures available for those who wish to avail themselves.    I cannot fault it at all. If I return to NYC I will certainly…,
205,Sweet Suite,I shouldn't keep writing great reviews| want to keep Giraffe a hidden gem. But| I can't help it. It's such a pleasure every visit. Great service| friendly but unintrusive. Perfect location near Madison Square Park and the Flatiron.  Our king suite was perfect for a 2-night getaway.   Thanks again to the consistently stellar staff of this lovely home away from home.,
149,Loved it,Great location| lovely rooms and reception areas.  The cleanliness of all areas was superb.  Reception staff were excellent but the security people could have done with a lesson in customer service.  Scowling seemed to be the order of the day for them| or to be fair| one in particular.  Trouble is you always remember that one bad experience over the many good ones.  As noted by others| the rooms pick-up a lot of street noise and air conditioning noise from adjacent buildings.  But hey| this is the city that never sleeps| and it didn't really bother us.  Overall we really enjoyed our stay and will almost certainly go back| provided they don't allow the prices to creep up more and keep the evening cheese and wine going!,
209,Superb - and what a change for the Big Apple - great value| amazing staffers!,It's all about attitude. A positive attitude. A caring demeanour. Being intimate and delivering above your size there| Mac! Giraffe does it all. And more. I LOVED it.   Extras - like the cheese and wine (my god) from 5-8pm|  the superb lobby breakfast. It  also feels very art-deco - almost what you think the Chrysler Building might be have been like in its heyday.   It's not in the quietest spot -  the sirens| the garbage trucks| the banging outside at 4am - come prepared for this. Get a room as high as you can| pop in $4 ear plugs (or those nicked off the plane over the Pond) and this becomes a super place with no downside.   Add in free Wifi - all for under $400 a night top whack - and you have| my friends| the greatest accommodation bargain I have yet found in the city that…,
6,Amazingly good service!,"Very good location of the hotel| close to the Empire State Building. We appreciate unusual service as ""evening wine & cheese party with live piano music"" or ""coffee| water and fruit at our disposal for 24/24"" - everything including in the price of the stay.",
88,Fantastic!,Arrived after a cruise and stayed two nights.  Wonderful boutique hotel.  We had cheeses| crackers| and huge chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us in our room.  There is a wonderful continental breakfast with croissants| bagels| cereals| fruit| juices| coffees and teas in the morning.  In the late afternoon they serve a variety of cheeses and crackers with wines and champagne.  Great staff that is so helpful plus a wonderful location.  Recommend enthusiastically!,
1,Good Location,I have been spend here for 3 Nights  Staff are nice and Good location for transpot. Near 28th Street-Lexington Avenue Subway Station As other reveiw said that |Room are clean. we will surely suggest other friend to come. Thank you,
4,Excellent Hotel,We stopped for two nights at the hotel.  We had been on the QM2 Southampton to New York and wanted to stop a couple of days in New York to revisit a few places before flying home.  I did a lot of research as when we last stayed in NY we were happy just to have a bed for the night and weren't worried by the luxuries.  However a few years on luxury is higher on our list!  The hotel looked lovely on the website but to be honest what swung it for us was the wine and cheese evenings| breakfast and tea/coffee and snacks supplied whenever touching base. The roof top garden was another pull and we were so lucky with the weather that we did take our coffee up there which was bliss. I knew I had picked the right hotel when the doorman was so friendly and helpful.  The room was just lovely…,
47,Great Location,Stayed here May 13| for 5 nights| we found the hotel| clean well presented and a good location. Room size was good| we booked the Balcony Suite with a King Bed. Complimentary breakfast was included| food was always fresh and available. really enjoyed this hotel and we will be re-booking on our next trip. Being super critical some things to be aware of| breakfast area gets busy on weekends| but management make every effort to get you a table. What is available for breakfast range is the same every day and quite limited. The bathroom could be interesting for some with a frosted glass door| that should have been frosted more :-).,
6,Great Hotel| Great Service,The hotel was very clean and nicely furnished. The bedding was comfortable and clean. The staff was friendly and extremely professional. One of the nicest places I have stayed at this price point. Location is great as well.,
138,Superb,Take the timne out of your life to travel and see the world.  Take time out of your life to enjoy the fine things.  The hotel giraffee is just one of those places.  Nice rooms| yes some are small and yes some do leak noise where the balcony doors do not close properly letting in sound.  Yes you could get frustrated at the lack of a service lift for the cleaners and caretakers who forever use the life at their own personal convenience hold open the doors on floors whilst endlessly blocking it with their carts.  Yes you could get irratated by the inconsistency of the reception staff.  But in truth all this does not matter| the hotel is a gem.  You should shop around for a deal| this place can be found on virtually all discount sites and the staff almost expect that you did as…,
1,Fab hotel with helpful staff!,This place went above and beyond to welcome us and make our stay something very special.  I told them we were here to celebrate my son's 10th birthday| our room was upgraded and we had chocolate milk on ice waiting when we checked in.  Staff were warm| friendly and knowledgable.  Free breakfast and snacks were a hit with everyone.  This hotel is elegant| sophisticated| but warm and friendly.,
45,Excellent stay in this awesome hotel,We stayed from may 2 to may 10 in a 2 double beds (3 adults) room. Let's 1st start with the only - tiny - reproach I will make: queen beds would have been much more appreciated (doubles are definitely not large enough| it is a pity that the hotel does not even propose them). That being said alĺthe rest was fantastic. The room was exactly as displayed on the web site. It was very large| very clean (as the whole hotel is anyway) and´with modern and cosy furnitures. Many drawers and hangers were available. So was a large safe deposit box. A very large flat TV (Sony!) was seating in the middle of the - large - desk and was offering many channels. Wifi was available in the room (everywhere in the hotel actually). A comfortable chair was located near the balcony that - despite being…,
252,Great location| comfortable rooms,I took a chance with the Hotel Tonight app & ended up at the Hotel Giraffe following a day in New York City for work. The hotel is part of the Library Hotel Collection| so even though I hadn’t stayed there before| I knew I was in good hands.  Check-in was a breeze & my room was ready for me when I arrived at 4pm. I was a little dismayed to find my room directly across from the elevators| usually a noisy spot| but hall noise was never an issue. My Balcony Guest Room with a King Bed was big by New York City standards & the cute little Juliet balcony was perfect for stepping out & getting some fresh air. The room had all sorts of gizmos & gadgets| including a switch by the bed which controlled a room darkening shade. The bathroom was a decent size & finished nicely. The tub was the…,
57,Great hotel in a great location,Can't say enough nice things about this place.  Very comfortable rooms| excellent staff| and located in a quiet yet central NYC location.  Great free bagels in the morning; bring back some Russ and Daughters smoked salmon for a real breakfast treat.,
16,Delightful hotel,Hotel Giraffe is a wonderful place to stay in New York| and we've stayed at many.  The service was outstanding.  The staff was incredibly responsive and made us feel welcome.  The room was very comfortable| and we took advantage of the complimentary continental breakfasts and afternoon wine and cheese.  The location was perfect - subway nearby and an easy walk to Grand Central.  The only reason the hotel does not get a perfect rating is the absence of a fitness center in the hotel.  My husband uses a fitness center daily| but he really dislikes having to leave the hotel in his workout togs.  Apart from that nitpick| this hotel is a winner.,
88,Heavenly - will absolutely stay again,I stayed at Hotel Giraffe for one night on the last night of a whirlwind trip that included New York and New England.  I was so tired when I arrived and the staff members were so polite and friendly.  The room was beautifully appointed and comfortable and I did not feel the slightest bit bad about spending my last night in NYC just crashing and relaxing in my hotel room.  The neighborhood is also great| close to the Empire State Building| Madison Square Park and Union Square.  I will definitely stay again and will suggest it to anyone traveling in the area.,
133,Perfect stay with no negatives whatsoever,When I write reviews| I try to list pros and cons about hotels so that readers can figure out for themselves what is important to them and what isn't. However| for Hotel Giraffe| I find it very hard to come up with cons: my partner and I had a perfect 7 night stay! We stayed in a room on the 7th floor with a king size bed and a small balcony going out onto Park Ave. For a New York hotel| the room was quite spacious| and although we had quite a bit of luggage| there was plenty of storage space that we could spread out. The bed was very comfortable| with plenty of cushions and options for more. The TV was on Time Warner Cable| with 5 HBO channels (which I found fantastic). Lighting was probably a little bit on the dark side but very atmospheric. The water pressure in the shower…,
168,Great stay at the Hotel Giraffe!,We arrived at the giraffe hotel and the bell man was right there to take our bags and show us to the front desk. We were greeted by a friendly person who check us in.  We stayed in a suite on the 12th floor facing 26th and it was surprisingly quiet.  It's NYC| so there was some noise| but not much.  The building must have good soundproofing and windows.  The front desk was very helpful when recommending restaurants.  We loved the complimentary continental breakfast.  Excellent latte| fruit| oatmeal| pastries etc. It was buffet style| but the hostess was very helpful and served the coffee and hot chocolate| which was nice.  It was either a manager or a front desk person who was walking around checking things at breakfast| and he noticed the coffee needed attention and he took…,
58,Absolutely Lovely,I was surprised by the size of the room for a NYC hotel - very spacious for 2 business colleagues. Dual work spaces| live plants| complimentary bottled water and 20% off their Italian Restaurant - Bread & Tulips.  Beautifully appointed room| warm| welcoming staff; a tranquil and sunlit lobby. Can't wait for the wine and cheese reception this evening. A definite must-stay next time I have work in the City.,
3,Easter break in NYC,We stayed as a family for five days form Easter and thoroughly enjoyed our stay in NYC at the Hotel Giraffe.  The hotel is on a corner of Park Ave South a block away form Madison Square and the Flatiron Building.  It is also convenient for the subway: the stopping service along the East Side has two stations within three minutes walk.  The hotel is a purpose built (1980s/90s?) building| about 10 floors (low by NYC standards!)|  the decor in the rooms is tasteful and the furniture comfortable.  The lobby is elegant and - unlike some hotels where you feel out of place sitting down in the public areas  - well used throughout the day: helped by complimentary tea and coffee throughout the day and cheese and wine in the early evening - perfect for post-shopping.  The staff were…,
66,Very pleased,We were very pleased with the Giraffe Hotel.  The room was clean with good facilities and the bed was comfortable.  The staff were lovely| very helpful.  Breakfast didn't have the biggest choice| but the food was always fresh and good quality.  Complimentary wine and cheese in the evenings was a very nice touch – a glass of prosecco and a few nibbles made a perfect start to the evening.,
66,Nice hotel - very expensive,Very nice hotel quite central NYC.  Rooms are a good size and the bathrooms were especially good.  Very good point of putting bottles of water in the room.  Free breakfast was excellent. Only downside was the cost.  That's NYC I guess.,
39,Perfect place to stay,I was here for a long weekend and I loved everything about the hotel. The breakfast was great| really good fresh bagels and pastries with fresh fruit and delicious coffee| the room was lovely| the staff friendly and helpful|and the midtown location was just perfect. The Flatiron building and the pretty Madison Square Park are literally just round the corner.  It is a little noisy because it's in central New York| but the double glazing is superb and I didn't have any problems sleeping (beyond my jet lag!) with ear plugs in. I was on the 8th floor on the 26th Street side.,
2,Awesome hotel!,My friends and I were lucky enough to spend the night at this fabulous hotel! It is conveniently located near some of New York's famous landmarks. There was also some wonderful restaurants close by. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I was very impressed with how clean and well maintained the property was. The hotel has a great continental breakfast as well as wine and cheese in the late afternoon. I would definitely recommend this hotel and can't wait to visit it again!,
29,What a Beautiful Experience,From the moment we stepped on the sidewalk it was amazing.  The staff was very professional| friendly and so helpful.  From parking our car| to bring up our luggage and also bringing us ice| all so helpful. I was so comfortable and made to relax immediately.  The décor in the lobby was outstanding| clean and beautifully decorated with fresh flowers all over. The room we had was large and nicely decorated| not to bright but not your dark hotel room.  It was beyond clean and smelled fresh.  The complimentary water was a nice touch.  We dropped our stuff off and went sight seeing. We returned in time to catch the ending of the wine & cheese in the lobby| with music playing and all. What a nice touch and so inviting.  Upon entering our room| beds were turned| chocolate on the…,
2,OUTSTANDING!!,The Hotel Giraffe was outstanding!! The staff was courteous| attentive and very polite. The hotel  was gorgeous and the room was immaculate.  It was a truly glorious experience! I recommend the Hotel Giraffe to everyone!,
4,Very impressed,My fiancee and I had a short stay in NYC but were very impressed with all aspects of Hotel Giraffe.  After an exhausting| delay-filled red eye trip across the US| we were delighted to be greeted by the hotel's friendly staff and a formidable spread of complimentary wine| cheese and crackers in the lobby.  The concierge even suggested that we take a few glasses of wine to our room while we got settled.  Our server suggested a great Italian restaurant about a block away for dinner.  We also thoroughly enjoyed the complimentary continental breakfast the next morning which fueled us for a long day of sightseeing and walking.  The room (a balcony suite) was clean and comfortable and had a nice view of Park Ave.  Highest recommendation.,
59,Giraffe was tops,We arrived after 4 tiring 4 hr drive through traffic and simply dropped our car out up front and our luggage was whisked away. Our 6th floor room was directly across from the elevator but we never heard a sound. On arrival we were directly to a generous wine and cheese reception in the lobby complete with comfy chairs and lovely unobtrusive live piano music. What respite from our drive! In the morning the area had a delicious continental breakfast - yum those pastries. Throughout the day there was fruit available| cookies and a self-serve coffee machine. The room was fine as was the bathroom. The price was high. But the ambiance| location and most of all hospitality from the moment we walked in just made it worth it.,
9,Fabulous hotel and top-notch staff!,I recently stayed at Hotel Giraffe| and was so happy with my experience! What a great choice we made to stay here. Centrally located to be able to walk to so many wonderful spots in New York City| including the Empire State Building! And the convenience of subway stations nearby also. The hotel was clean| the beds were comfy| the bathrooms were big| and the staff was amazing! Top-notch staff indeed! From the kindness of the doorman| which incidentally always made you feel both safe and fancy| to the professionalism of the front desk staff. And then to top if off? A daily wine hour| actually hours!| for hotel guests. What a great way to come in from your daily adventures and wind down with a complimentary glass of champagne| cheese and crackers| and lovely live piano music. Just…,
116,Great Hotel!,Picked this hotel based on reviews and location and it didn't disappoint. Rooms are very comfortable and service from the moment you check in until you check out is exceptional. By simply sending them a note via Twitter we were treated to a complimentary bottle of wine on our arrival. The complimentary continental breakfast and evening wine and cheese reception were also added bonuses. Unlike other hotels that nickel and dime you at every turn for extra services| the Hotel Giraffe includes them in their room prices enhancing your comfort. Only quibble is the mini bar. According to the staff they are not kept very cold so you can't use them as a fridge for your own items and if you want to have a cold drink| you'll still have to cool them the old fashioned way. However| they will…,
54,Excellence in Manhattan,We stayed at the Giraffe for 4 nights.  It was our 5th trip to NYC and from now on will only be staying there!  It was perfect.  The staff were EXTREMELY friendly and helpful.  They were unbelievably kind and knowledgeable.  The rooms were very clean| modern and comfortable.  We especially enjoyed the very fresh continental breakfast and the excellent full automatic coffee machine complete with Italian LaVazza coffee available throughout the day.  The wine and cheese offered every evening was basically the cherry on top of the perfect Manhattan experience.  We totally loved the late 1 pm check out!  The proximity to outstanding restaurants| clubs and shopping made the Giraffe's location world class!  LOVE LOVE LOVE the Giraffe!,
18,elegant and understated| with a genuine hospitality ethos,So refreshing to stay at a hotel where hospitality is really the keyword: complimentary wifi| aperitif in the evening and breakfast in the morning all on the house -- and with a smile. The hotel has an amazing location just a few blocks from Union square| on Park Avenue. The rooftop terrace on a sunny day is spectacular and in the evenings very romantic. The balcony from the queen room on the 11th floor where we stayed gave a lovely view of city life underneath while being relatively quiet at night. Understated and elegant rooms| at first I thought the hotel wouldn't me my style| but my first impression was completely overturned during the stay. This hotel will grow on you so much you will be heartbroken to leave. Helpful| professional and un-intrusive staff. Highly recommended|…,
16,Really enjoyed our stay.,Really enjoyed our stay at he Hotel Giraffe.  The room was beautiful and very comfortable.  Loved the wine in the lobby in the evening| and coffee and breakfast in the morning.  We would definitely stay here again.,
1,Wonderful hotel.....,"In the words of my mother "" if you don't have anything nice to say| then don't sat anything at all""| and it is with this matra that i write my first review.   The hotel is beyond excellent for the price you pay| having travelled to New York many times| this hotel is by far the best value for money I have ever stayed in. The staff were exceptionally polite| friendly and helpful.  Even though me and my cousins left the room in an absolute pigsty| we came back everyday to find it looking like a palace. This is above and beyond what is expected of any housekeeper and we can only apologise for out untidiness.  The location is superb and the breakfast and evening snacks are a pleasant extra.   Once again I would like to thank all the staff for a incredible stay and wonderful…",
6,Great hotel,Just back from a great week in New York staying at the giraffe. Lovely hotel| good location | would definitely recommend. Breakfast set us up for the day. Location allows you set off in any direction.  Check out the restaurant down stairs .,
178,Upscale boutique hotel in Manhatten,Sophisticated but comfortable| Giraffe hotel provides a wonderful basis to explore New York. The lobby is an inviting and lovely place to eat breakfast and savor a cup of coffee while watching the city before venturing out on your own. The hotel staff is effective but not warm. The rooms are good sized by NY standards. The evening wine and cheese is also worth attending. The locale is centralized but you will have a fair walk to the theater district or to lower Manhattan. There are restaurants nearby and its far enough away from Times Square madness to allow you to enjoy NYC at its best. We loved the piano in the lobby and in the evenings they had live music. A real treat!,
5,Great hotel,We stayed here over Independance Day in 2012.  we had a family room with two double beds. We really could not fault this hotel and the staff were incredibly helpful. The location suited us as it was just that bit less hectic!,
53,Expensive hotel a bit off...,Nice hotel with ok service. The receptionists and the door-men are very young and not as formal as the staff at many other hotels. For me (lady 55 years old) this was a bit hard to get used to.  Big rooms with nice beds. Walking-distance to Union Square. Park Avenue is a very calm street down here. You sleep well| but you have to walk some blocks to find shops and restaurants. A breakfast is served in the lobby every morning| and there is a wine-reception every afternoon. Both free of charge.  Good italien restaurant in the basement.,
8,LOVELY HOTEL WITH EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE,This hotel was recommended to me by a family member.  I am very particular about cleanliness and service and I have to say this hotel was exceptional on both accounts.  I would definately stay again and recommend it to family and friends.  thank you.,
17,Escape the Crowds,The Hotel Giraffe is a lovely place to stay in NYC. The staff is helpful and gracious. We stayed for five days over Spring Break this year. The lobby breakfast is a perfect way to get the day started with no stress| the location is excellent whether you are going Uptown or Downtown| and there is a California PIzza Kitchen just a few blocks away when the kids are ready for some familiar food.  The king suite was great for three people. The room was clean and well appointed.  The confirming e-mails were very helpful. An added bonus is the restaurant| Bread and Tulips| which is on the premises. It is excellent and we recommend it even if you are not staying at the hotel.  Next time I would bring my own shampoo; we were not crazy about the hotel supplied shampoo/cream rinse.   We…,
25,A haven in NYC,Our family of 3 adults and 2 teens spent 10 wonderful nights at the Hotel Giraffe in March/April. After exhaustive research attempting to find the right place to stay we were extremely happy with our choice.  The staff were unfailingly helpful and friendly (one of our party is coeliac| so needed gluten free options for the included breakfast)| and we felt an instant sense of comfort and welcome each time we returned to the hotel after long| cold days in the city. The rooms were nice (our children had a KS Balcony Suite| and we a King room) and well maintained.  Our only negative was the extra firm beds.  When we asked for a topper to soften the feel of the beds in both rooms they were provided| and the beds re-made| within 5 minutes - very impressive service in a city whose…,
137,Excellent staff and service,The personell at this hotel are great and efficiently supports you with whatever you may need. The rooms are large enough| quite modern| and spotlessly clean. Furthermore| the breakfast is nothing but delicious and the free afternoon wine and cheese session (with unlimited refill as it seemed!) is a great bonus. And the location is alright with Midtown| Chelsea| and East village within walking distance as well as the subway only two blocks away. There are| however| a few negative points. The price is of course one| but that is common for most hotels in NY... What bothered us the most was the noise level from the air conditioning system| the hallway| and not at least the street. There seemed to be some kind of loading bay for trucks just outside that the thin balcony doors let…,
147,Great hotel unless you want to sleep,There are parts of the Hotel Giraffe that are wonderful - the friendly staff| lovely wine and cheese reception and complimentary breakfast| free wireless| big rooms with nice amenities and central location.  And if you're not looking to sleep| then it's great.  But if you want any shut eye| forget staying here.  We just stayed and the constant noise from cars| trucks| sirens and drunk passerbys at the restaurants and clubs on the street below kept us up until 4am.  And since I had to get up for work at 6| it didn't make for a restful night.  When I called at 2:30am to see if the front desk had a remedy| their only recourse was ear plugs.  Not much help.  And my husband and I lived in NYC and are used to its noise| but neither of us have ever stayed in a room this loud.  And even…,
42,Superb Service and Quality,Myself| husband and adult daughter stayed here for 5 nights over Easter. I had done a lot of research before our trip and chose Hotel Giraffe based on trip advisor reviews| as well as other sites. We were not disappointed! From the confirmation emails| help with transport from the airport| restaurant recommendations| friendly front desk staff| to advice on travel within the city| the service was impeccable! I have not experienced such wonderful| personal service before at any hotel| and we do travel quite a bit in many different countries. The room was outstanding; we had a King Suite with balcony. The bed and linens were extremely soft and comfortable| there were plenty of mirrors which was appreciated when getting ready for a night out. We loved the nightly turndown service|…,
2,Soothing place to stay,We only had one night in the Hotel Giraffe but it made a big impression.  Our room was extremely comfortable| spotlessly clean and with lots of thoughtful touches.  It was as quiet as could be for such a great central locaton in Midtown Manhattan.  The greatest asset was the staff - they were all unfailingly friendly and helpful (right from the email reply to a query a few minutes after the booking was made) and went well beyond what we could have reasonably expected for guests on just a one-night stay.  The breakfast was generous and tasty| and the wine and cheese in the evening and the relaxed feel of the lobby made the place very homely.  Sadly| New York hotels don't come cheap but this is well worth the money!,
2,My new favorite hotel in NYC!,This was my third stay at the Hotel Giraffe.  I usually travel alone and find the reception lobby to be a very welcoming| inviting place.  The staff| just to name a few... Simona| Jose and Chris are so kind and helpful.  All employees are phenomenal.  Very clean hotel (extremely important to me) in a great location!,
62,Classy & Cool,We booked room 801| classic King suite. Hotel Giraffe is a gem! Great location| very clean|and terrific amenities. The bed was very comfortable| room a good size with tall ceilings. Breakfast was so convenient and very good. I loooovved the lattes! Fresh fruit! The evening wine and cheese reception with piano player was very elegant. We also took advantage of Bread & Tulips restaurant in hotel and received a 20% discount. I highly recommend Hotel Giraffe. We took my college aged son and girlfriend and really enjoyed our visit.,
53,Giraffes are beautiful animals - just like this hotel!,Just stayed at the Giraffe for a long weekend with my husband.  The hotel was great!  Our room was of a generous size and always carefully cleaned and looked after.  The bathroom was a good size too.  The bed was big and was really comfy.  The drinks in reception (coffee/ tea/ wine etc) were a nice touch and always welcome.  The staff were attentive - always professional and polite.  The hotel always had a calm| hushed atmosphere| which was very relaxing.  Unfortunately| probably because our room overlooked Park Avenue| the traffic sound could be quite intrusive at night.  But - overall - I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again - but next time I will take some ear plugs with me,
5,Couldnt have asked for a better hotel,My husband and myself spent four nights in this hotel in March and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in.  The Receptionists and all the staff were very pleasant and very welcoming.  The room itself was very clean and spacious and the bed very comfortable.  The hotel was ideally situated and was a lovely place to come back to after our days of sightseeing.  The breakfast was ample and set us up for the day.  As we were away for most of the day| we did not avail of the snacks and coffee/tea but were back in time for the wine and cheese| which were delicious. I would definitely stay at this hotel when| hopefully| I will be back in New York again.  I would also recommend this hotel to any friends that would be heading over.,
25,Very friendly mid-town hotel,One of the friendliest places you will stay. Staff really welcoming and helpful throughout our five day stay. Very handy location in the mid-town district.  Rooms spacey and comfortable. Breakfast selection was good and having drinks and snacks available in the lobby all day is a nice touch| especially after a long sightseeing day. Breakfast area can get a bit crowded at busiest times but that is a minor issue in an otherwise delightful hotel.,
25,Very Good Over All Experience,I think we went for this hotel because of the many good reviews it has received online here. Overall we were not disappointed. The staff were were warm and welcoming and that was appreciated.  We took a room with a balcony and it was very comfortable and the bed made for a good night sleep. The breakfast was good each morning and consisted of a selection of cereals| fruit salad and different breads and pastries. The evening cheese and wine was very welcome after a day around town doing the sights!!! The staff who tended to both the breakfast and evening session were top class and very gracious.  A few minor complaints - there was no tea/coffee making facility in the bedrooms - while we appreciated that such facilities being available in the lobby their absence from the room was…,
29,wonderful!,Have stayed at many hotels in NYC| but the feel of this one is different.. You are truly a welcomed customer here.  Everything is handled quickly and efficiently and with a smile!  The breakfast was lovely| snacks throughout the day ( in the lobby) and a nice wine and cheese pairing in the evening.  The atmosphere was like a small European hotel..  Room was great with a small balcony and very comfortable bed.  Looking forward to another stay!,
24,Delightful place in every way!,I stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for the second time| at the end of March 2013| with my husband and one daughter.  When I visited in the fall (2012)| my first trip included both of my children| and my 84-year old mother| as well as my husband.  Suffice it to say that if a Nobel prize was given for the capacity to complain| someone in my family would have won it easily years ago.  Nevertheless| no one has anything but the best to say about the Hotel Giraffe.  The hotel is clean| and the décor is most tasteful.  The hotel staff are amazing.  On the fall trip| one of the young men at the front of the hotel literally ran down the street to hail us a SUV-sized cab| one big enough for all of us.  The mattresses in this place are really good| and my husband says he sleeps better at this…,
166,Terrific,We stayed for 6 nights in March. Couldn't fault it - yes it was pricey but the service and experience were worth it. Rooms were spotless| meticulously looked after. The all day coffee bar and wine and cheese in the evening were lovely touches. Very centrally located and lovely to come back to after a day exploring New York. Only criticism (and it's a very small one) is that as the breakfast area isn't very big| it could sometimes get a bit hectic but staff worked tirelessly to make sure tables were cleared away and food was topped up.  We had a room at the front with a balcony and the first night was noisy| however| you soon get used to sleeping with the sounds of cars and horns tooting and we slept fabulously every night in the huge bed.  If we went back to New York we wouldn't…,
15,a special location in NY,We have stayed at a number of hotels in NYC but this has been by the best. Excellent service and the breakfast . It's in a good location with very clean rooms| although the room was very small|  good standard...,
11,Really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Giraffe,This small boutique hotel deserves its high ranking on TripAdvisor. Hotel Giraffe was our hotel of choice on a recent stay in New York coming off a visit to South Africa.  My husband and I arrived at Hotel Giraffe in the early morning of March 15 following a 17 hour flight firstly from a safari park on the Botswana border and then overnight from Johannesburg to New York.  On arrival| and feeling less than energetic| we were greeted very warmly by the staff and directed to the fresh coffee and breakfast snacks available in the lobby.  Within 30 minutes our room was ready for us and we were thankfully able to catch up on some much needed sleep before starting our sightseeing activities in New York.  Our accommodation was a corner suite on the 6th floor and we were very comfortable…,
12,A cracking hotel - everything we wanted,We stayed at Hotel Giraffe for 4 nights in March.  It is very conveniently located for a holiday exploring all that Manhattan has to offer and although the subway system in NYC is pretty shoddy| we got everywhere we needed to pretty easily as Park Avenue is convenient for hailing a cab as well.  We stayed in a King room with balcony and found the room to be generously sized and tastefully decorated.  The bathroom was not quite so large but perfectly adequate.  Crucially the shower was powerful and plenty hot enough.  There are lots of little touches with this hotel which make it stand out and ensure it would be top of my list to stay if I were to return to New York.  Bathrobes and slippers in the room| complimentary bottles of water laid out each night| 24hr tea and coffee in…,
97,A little disappointing...,Nice enough room| comfortable and well maintained. Not cheap...expected more for the money.. All a bit dated| old fashioned shower etc| Luke warm water. No tea or coffee in room. Too many other better hotels at similar price in NY,
5,Home away from home,Stayed here last week and had a great experience.  Everyone is so friendly and helpful.  The evening wine and cheese in the lobby is relaxing and as a single traveler| I felt quite comfortable there.  My daughter|  who lives in New York| was having some medical issues and so the visit was unplanned and stressful.  It was the perfect place for us to relax and escape. I was very happy to discover that I had been upgraded to a suite at check-in without any request from me.  I have stayed here several times but appreciated it even more this time as it was convenient| familiar and comfortable.  When thinking of a hotel for the trip| I did not hesitate in choosing the Hotel Giraffe.,
133,A new favorite in Manhattan,My family of 3 stayed here for spring break.  The location was great--close to a number of subway stations and quite a few good restaurants and shopping.  From the hotel| we walked to  SOHO| the Village and Chelsea Market| and could have walked to Penn Station| if our bags had been lighter.  The staff were very friendly and helpful| always greeting us with a smile and a pleasant welcome back at the end of a long day.  The King Suite gave us plenty of room to spread out--unlike most NYC hotels--and the room had two good sized closets for storage.  We were on the 26th street side of the building and on a higher floor| and while you could of course hear some city noise| it was not at all intrusive or disturbing.   The lobby was very welcoming and comfortable and the breakfast|…,
191,Get's the job done and then some,The hotel is located a bit south of the prime mid-town attractions and is a comfortable 15 minute walk from Penn Station so it can work well for lots of traveler demands. It's on the corner of Park Ave so that makes it pretty easy to spot and locate.   The reception desk is tiny and a bit cramped which limits its appeal but the people working this area are exceptional. Top notch.  The lobby has a casual upscale feel to it with wine and snacks in the late afternoon| accompanied by a pianist. Corner views of Park Ave give it a nice feel. Adjoining restaurant is hip and better than average.   The rooms are nicely appointed| spacious and made for the modern traveler. Comfortable beds| not noisy| good desk area| average bathroom (lots of counter space).  Elevators respond quickly|…,
35,Very good,Stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for a long weekend closed to Christmas. The rooms and location were absolutely fantastic. Having the roof top bar to ourselves due to the weather was also a treat and we were wrapped up nice and warm! WiFi was free| but then again I would expect that given the cost of staying here. The free wine and cheese reception was a rally nice touch and really appreciated after a long day.  A few minor service niggles stop me from giving 5 out of 5| such as running out of crockery at breakfast and a lost booking for the restaurant for a birthday meal.,
4,Very good Hotel,This Hotel is perfectly located in Manhattan. It has a nice lobby and comfortable well equipped rooms. Very nice is also the idea with wine and cheese. The staff was outstanding friendly. All sights could be visited easily. All together it was a perfect stay. For a next visit we will again choose this hotel.,
1,Clean| spacious| beautiful| friendly| amazing location!,We absolutely loved our stay at Hotel Giraffe and know that it will be the only hotel we will return to when visiting NYC.  Right near Madison Square Park| close to the subway| lovely views| huge room| super helpful staff| and an amazing restaurant (Bread & Tulips) where you can take advantage of 20% off as a hotel guest or room service if you choose!  We brought our two children| ages 4 & 2 and it was extremely kid-friendly and safe| and they were always welcomed and accommodated at the complimentary breakfast & evening wine and cheese- which were both such lovely perks!  The walls/doors/furniture are solid and well insulated| so we didn't have any trouble with noise or being able to hear sound from other rooms.  There were fluffy robes and a complimentary umbrella in our room…,
6,My New Favorite NYC Hotel!,Great Location| Great Room| Great Staff!  The lobby is very comfortable and morning breakfast and afternoon wine and cheese were wonderful benefits.  Thank you for having free WIFI!  Every hotel should do that.  This will be the hotel we return to every year on our visit to New York.,
8,Great Location,After much deliberation our party of four decided on this hotel out of the many to choose from in New York.  It really is worth a visit| our rooms were clean and spacious| the staff friendly and helpful| the breakfast is more than adequate and the 24 hour tea and coffee available in reception 'kind of' makes up for the lack of the facility within the room.  The rooftop garden is lovely but at this time of year some sort of outdoor heater would be good.  The complimentary cheese and wine in the  early evening is a very nice touch.  Finally  the location is just ideal- we never struggled to get a taxi outside the hotel at all times of day and night| and it was within walking distance  of some lovey restaurants.   For us it was a great value for money choice.,
2,The Best Hotel In NYC,Every time we visit NYC the only hotel we consider is The Hotel Giraffe. The rooms are spacious| by New York standards| and the beds are oh so comfortable. The linens luxurious and the decor elegant. We love the lobby| it is comfortable and cozy...the late afternoon wine and cheese is a lovely way to start your evening in the city and the breaksfasts are just perfect. We love the fact that you can always get an excellent cappucino in the lobby as well. The staff is always friendly and eager to help. They are extremely attentive and hope that everyone's stay is perfect. It is so nice to see that after years of visiting Hotel Giraffe it does not look worn in any way. The carpets are immaculate| not shabby or stained| and the linens as elegant as ever. It is a plus that each room…,
4,Charming and Cozy,I was surprised at how good this hotel is for an individual hotel vs. a chain. Rooms were clean big and very attractive rates| wine and cheese at 5p & breakfast where a huge plus. Once I checked in and got to my room| I got a call from the front desk to check if the room met my needs| I travel to NY a lot but this is the first time that's happened. This was a business trip for me but next time I am in the area with my wife I will stay here.,
13,The Best place to Stay in NYC,The Giraffe upgraded our room when we arrived. The room was very clean and well decorated. The bed was very comfortable. The doorman was very friendly. The front desk staff were helpful and a pleasure to deal with. The restaurant on site was excellent. the lobby was comfortable and they always had refreshments available. This hotel is probably the best value in New york,
21,Perfect for business or pleasure,We returned to New York for the March Break holiday having enjoyed warm weather and a great stay at the Kimpton Eventi last year. Although the weather let us down this time the Giraffe was in line with our high expectations. We were in an 11th floor two queen room with balcony which was smart| modern and more than big enough for a family of 3. There is still no escape from the New York street noise but we got used to it and we heard nothing from adjacent rooms on the floor (more important to me). We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast| which offered nice fresh fruit and excellent mini-pastries in a civilized atmosphere. The informal wine and cheese evenings|with a nice balance of tourists and business people| were a joy with a glass or two of prosecco to help wind down after a…,
67,Nothing Outstanding,The good points... Staff are friendly| welcoming and helpful. The complimentary continental breakfast is adequate and the Cheese and Wine in the evening is a nice touch. Complimentary coffee and cookies 24 hours a day is also good. The room was an average double size| ok for two people. Good location (unless you are here over the St Patricks Day weekend and the whole of the US Army is camped over the road and practicing from 3am-7am!). About 25 minutes walk from Times Square and 15 minutes to Empire State Building and Macy's.  The not so good points... It is rather noisy outside 24 hours a day (army or not) but I guess it would be worse if we were closer to Times Square. The electrics in our room were slightly dodgy with my Wife getting a shock at one point! Holes in bed sheets…,
6,Favourite hotel I've been to,Staff was very helpful and the hotel itself was beautiful. We hung out in the upstairs garden quite a bit and took advantage of the free breakfasts. Amazing location as well. close to a lot of attractions,
202,Beautiful hotel,We stayed one night at the end of our stay. We booked two interconnecting rooms with balconies to accommodate 2 adults and 2 teenagers. They did a great deal on the rooms in the end because there had been a misunderstanding about an email enquiry I had made before booking| for which they apologised promptly and offered a discount on the rooms. The rooms were clean| well appointed and spacious. The service was excellent and we loved the drinks and nibbles in the early evening.,
69,Sophisticated and cozy,Sophisticated and cozy hotel—it’s rare to stay somewhere that has both of these qualities. The staff is warm and inviting| always greeting you with a smile.  The small attentions to detail are captured at this establishment—complimentary continental breakfast| a phone call to confirm your reservation| and a phone call to your room after check-in to make sure all is well are just a few examples.  The balcony suite was lovely—the layout| furnishings| décor| and Juliet balcony combine together to create a comfortable and unique room.  Charming “find” in NYC—can’t wait to stay here again.,
64,A Perfect New York Getaway,Once again we'd like to extend a huge thank-you to Trip Advisor for leading us to a fantastic hotel.  Although I used to live in Manhattan| that was many years ago| and my knowledge of current New York City hotels is nonexistent.  So my husband and I turned to Trip Advisor and booked the Hotel Giraffe.  Every lovely thing that people express regarding this hotel is absolutely correct.  The Hotel Giraffe is beautiful| comfortable| clean| and convenient.  It is luxurious without being pretentious| modern without being minimalist.  The wine and cheese at 5pm is a treat| breakfast is above adequate and tasty.  The lounge/dining area is full of dark wood| large windows| and a lot of light.  The staff is attentive and pleasant.  Our room| while facing Park Avenue| was still very…,
6,Great Hotel,We were on the mini suite at 7th floor. The room was nice and clean| actually a bit more than we bargained for. The service is understated and friendly| just as its suppose to be. The first nice surprise was the call a few minutes after we got into the room asking if we're OK with the room.  It was very clear that if we had a complaint - they were there to listen and fix right away. The other great thing is the free 5-8pm coffee and snacks they have in the lobby. It’s just great to come back from the city| just before leaving later for the rest of the evening adventures in NYC.,
44,Lovely Boutique Hotel - Easily would stay here again.,Was pleasantly surprised with the size given it being in NYC. Whilst it still wasn't huge| it was nicely appointed and spacious enough that you could relax and spread out. Rather tranquil and the hustle of NYC seems to disappear when you enter.  I originally chose this hotel due to the balcony/terrace| though it's so small I wasn't game to stand out on it| so up to the wonderful roof top instead.  Breakfast is basic - but enough to get you started. Staff were all great and friendly.  I was back in NYC a few weeks later| it was a pity it was booked out as I'd easily stay here again.  Location wise| a little out of the main tourist areas for those that can't walk far| but not too far from Empire State (just don't catch the last hop-on/hop-off buses that ends at Times Square -…,
47,Fun stay in New York,"We stayed there for 3 nights before Christmas! The atmosphere in the hotel is very relaxing - lovely breakfasts in the morning and relaxing over a glass of wine with cheese in the evening was great! They have a pianist playing in the evening which is so peaceful. The rooms were perfectly fine....nicely decorated and quiet. We were a family of 4 and had 2 rooms which could be ""connected"" by a door that shut to make it almost a 2 bedroom suite. The staff were lovely and the restaurant was delicious for lunch! Will definately be back! Oh and the location was great for us...not far from Union Square!",
7,Unexpectedly fantastic!,What a great hotel. the front desk staff went out of their way to be accommodating. The doorman was almost offended if you didnt allow him to take care of you. Spectacular continental breakfast in the morning| delightful wine and cheese reception in the evening; Hotel Giraffe should be a destination stay when in New York. We have finally found...'the place to stay.' I had a tough time on the full beds that were very firm| but that will not be a deterrent. the accommodations were spotless!,
1,Feb 2013,Great stay! The continental breakfast was substantial (yummy bagels!)| and there were always refreshments available in the lobby. The rooms were clean and spacious (esp for NYC). I would be happy to return again!,
15,Giraffe. Super hotel.,Stayed 6 nights at the Giraffe hotel| Manhattan in Feb 2013. Lovely hotel| situated on 26th St| Park Ave (4th ave) far enough away from Times Sq to avoid most of the noise through the night| yet close enough to walk to and no need for a cab| with comfortable| very clean rooms. All the staff very helpful. Breakfast in the morning was a self service arrangement but always a couple of staff going out of their way to help out with anything we needed. Complimentary wine and cheese every night between 6pm and 8pm ( unfortunately we missed this most nights because we didn't return to the hotel until around 10pm ) The hotel book us a 'Limo' style car for our return to JFK| cheaper than the tatty yellow cab we picked up from the airport on our arrival. We would recommend this hotel and…,
48,Wonderful NYC Experience,My college friends and I have been getting together for years in NYC.  This year we chode the Hotel Giraffe and could not have been more pleased.  From the doorman| to the clerk at the front desk| to the chamber maids|  to the servers at breakfast and evening reception - no stone was left unturned when it came to taking care of us.  Friendly| efficient and professional assistance awaited our requests.  We were able to walk to many locations despite the snow storm!    I cannot recommend this hotel enough - amenities were fabulous and the breakfast and evening reception were very generous....Cant wait to go back!,
26,Nice hotel| would definitely stay here again.,In town for business and the hotel was one of the places recommend by our contact. The price was in line with similar hotels but the amenities were better. Spacious (for NYC) room with a nice little balcony and a generous bathroom. For those who have stayed in NYC hotels| you know that most bathrooms are pretty darn tight. Anyway... The staff was first rate and took care of us and the requests we had| things like holding the luggage all day while we were at a meeting| etc. (Be sure to tip the bellmen folks they are helping you out.) In order to not be so swooning in my review as to not be believable| if I had to point to one thing that I didn't like it was that the room could have been a bit darker. Even with the shades there were still a lot of light leaks from the…,
403,Excellent stay at giraffe,Beautiful and modern hotel centrally located. Walking distance to a lot of places| five minutes to flatiron building| ten minutes to empire state building| half an hour to times square| half an hour to greenwich/soho. Rooms are tastefully decorated| very spacious. Comfortable bed and pillows. The balcony is a plus| though too cold to stay on it at this time of the year. Staff are very friendly. Best thing is the complimentary drinks and snacks throughout the day| especially the cheese and wine in the evening. Breakfast though a bit simple| enough to fill the belly. Sometimes need to share a table. A bit pricy| but for this kind of location| comfort and service| definitely worth it. Would highly recommend this hotel| and already thinking of our return visit.,
1,great stay,very good stay my family loved it. Had a great time in New york and Hotel Giraffe made it much better. The staff was very nice and the rooms were nice and clean. The value was great and so was the location. Will be coming back soon.,
5,Great location and value!,Have been coming to NY annually for the past 10 years.  This is the second time I have stayed at Hotel Giraffe.  It has become our favorite place to stay.  Love the location| amenities and the friendliness/professionalism of the staff.  Highly recommend it.  Coming to stay again in May.,
43,Calm oasis in busy city,We booked the hotel having tried the Library hotel first| I was encourageed by the others reviews and everything others have said is true. The staff are friendly| efficient| helpful and courteous. The hotel is immaculate and the breakfast a great start to a days sightseeing. The hotel is ideally located away from the real madness but close enough to walk to most Mid Town attractions.  We booked the suite and only small complaint would be the bed was not ready in the living room for our daugher but this was immediately remedied. The wine and cheese between 5 and 8 are a real bonus and a lovely way to end a busy day. We also ate in the restaurant which was excellent and reasonable value although very warm!  I would not hesitate to book again if we are lucky enough to go back to…,
4,excellent,My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for the second time after staying in other hotels in the Union Square area over the past few years. Cannot say enough about how wonderful the experience was. The staff is very friendly and accommodating| the rooms are lovely| well equipped although small if you are used to larger rooms in other cities - but  average by NYC standards. It was a cold| windy weekend but the windows and doors are so well insulated that we barely had to turn on the heat - and the noise level is so low that you can forget that you are on Park Avenue in NYC. Then| there is the complimentary cont,
36,Wonderful December Stay in Hotel Giraffe,I didn't think Hotel Giraffe would live up to the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor but| I have to say| that the service was excellent.  We were seven ladies spending four nights in NYC to celebrate our birthdays.  We mentioned this on booking our three rooms and| to our delight| found a kind card and bottle of celebratory wine in each room.  As described in several other reviews| there was a bountiful breakfast included in the price.  It saved us a lot of money....and time in the mornings.  We also enjoyed the afternoon nibbles.  Just what we needed after another's day of hard walking around the streets of NYC.  There was a little street noise (we were in corner rooms on floors 2| 5 and 7) but no noise from adjacent rooms/residents.  Staff were very helpful (hailing taxis|…,
33,Simply excellent,Except that we didn't take the more expensive rooms| I can agree almost completely with carabinier's review “Excellent value| excellent location| excellent hotel”. The room tended to be a bit noisy in the morning| though| due to the morning traffic. But that really is a minor detail| and it didn't prevent us from having a perfect week in New York.,
8,Another A+ stay,I've stayed at the Giraffe last year and I was very please with the service| attention and experience I've had at that time. I went back again this year and for sure wasn't disappointed at all.    The service was professional and courteous. I appreciated very much all the little attention the hotel was providing us all over the course of the day| from breakfast to the happy hours. Food was excellent.  The room was very nice. Had plenty of space to relax in the separate room from the bedroom. One thing important is that even though it is located at the corner of the 26 and Park| the room are very well soundproof and you hardly hear outside noise ( i was lodging on the 7th floor).,
58,Excellent value| excellent location| excellent hotel,This was our 7th stay at the Giraffe since 2006 and we keep coming back because it is such a great hotel for tourists and business people alike. It is very conveniently situated in Midtown Manhattan between Union Square and Grand Central Station| both a reasonable walk. It is also only a couple of blocks from the subway. It is surrounded by plently of very good restaurants and bars.  The hotel has many assets not just location. It is beautifully run| with excellent staff who are welcoming| helpful| and efficient. The rooms are all a very generous size| in a city where hotel rooms are notoriously small. They are very well equipped and furnished| with very comfortable beds. We tend to ask for the slightly more expensive rooms with a king size bed and have always found it…,
65,A second visit,Having visited this hotel for a second time| I thought it worth updating my previous review.  My room was excellent - a mini suite - but very noisy as I was on the corner and had traffic on both sides - being on the 3rd floor wasn't sufficient distance.  I arrived on a Sunday evening at 9pm having travelled from London to be told that there is no food served in the hotel on Sunday evenings - no room service or restaurant.  As a diabetic this was not great news and I had to go out to find food| very tired (with a five hour time difference) and a woman in NY alone - it wasn't a fun experience.  This is something the hotel really needs to sort out as many travellers from London arrive on a Sunday evening to start work on the Monday morning - even a sandwich would be sufficient. …,
18,Great NY value,The Giraffe is a real bargain by NY standards.  The lobby is lovely and stocked with cookies and pastries.  In the AM there is a continental breakfast| and in the evenings| complimentary wine and cheese. The rooms are comfortable and| for NY| good sized. Everyone is friendly and the staff really works hard to ensure a good stay. Highly recommended.,
1,MY GRANDAUGTHER LOVES THE COOKIES,My wife and I stayed here on my daughters passed experence here and yes she was right the staff and the rooms were the best.  Ps. my 8 year old granddaughte loves the cookie she says they are the best in the world| yes how can you top this.  Well everyday we have wine and cheese in the evening.  Great morning coffee and you name it you don't go hungry| yes and it's all included.  Ps. Best of all the cookies if you don't beleive me ask my granddaughter.  Yes I did get a chance to meet the Manager of this fine Hotel| he sure is doing something right.  Because my daughter and all her friends stay here everytime they are in New York.   I am late with this review.  Thank You Staff and Manager for always a wonderful stay. from Grandpal and all of us.  Yes my granddaughter too.,
13,Winter 2013,This was my 2nd time to stay at the Hotel Giraffe| and everything I remembered from my 1st visit was true. Great service| great atmosphere| great location| great amenities| great lobby. Who could ask for anything more? Worth every penny. Love the staff! This is the only place we will ever stay in the city.,
32,Our favourite boutique hotel in New York,You know you have arrived at a wonderful property the second you walk through the doors.  The warm greeting| the care in making sure you are comfortable and well looked after is evident.  The hotel is in the perfect location| no matter where it is that you need to go.  The comfort of the lobby| which changes throughout the day; offering a perfect breakfast to begin| mid afternoon snacks and beverages| evening wine and cheese while listening to the piano. The room was incredibly quiet| a perfect layout with a feeling of luxury from the comfort of the bed to the relaxing bathroom. This is definitely our Go - To Hotel whenever in New York & we would also look forward to staying at the other properties within this collection as there are 3 more. Such a pleasant stay!,
6,Perfect boutique hotel!,Beautiful| clean| excellent service! One of the best hotels to stay in when you visit NYC! Rooms are perfect| beds comfortable with luxurious bedding| great breakfast| wine and cheese| very friendly and helpful staff.,
72,Hotel Giraffe .. My Favorite in NYC,Very clean| quiet| private| upscale with an attentive staff.  the morning offers a wonderful continental breakfast with rich coffee| muffins| NY bagels| lox and much more.  The evening provides a a lobby setting with piano music| wine| cheese and opportunity for a relaxing conversation.  My favorite hotel in NYC.,
19,Midtown treat,We spent 4 days in Hotel Giraffe at the end of our trip| as a treat.  It was great - very comfortable| with high quality fixtures and great luxury touches.  Worth every penny.   Small point for management: having only one folding suitcase rack for a room that size is inconvenient.  Two would make this pretty close to perfect :),
1,Gem!,Nice clean rooms| friendly staff| excellent service. Descent continental breakfast and enjoyable afternoon wine reception. Good location and close to subway. A couple of great restaurants nearby| try BLT Prime! No reason whatsoever to stay anywhere else in NY!,
6,Great location| wonderful staff,We stayed here for five nights after reading the recommendations from other trip advisers. It was a lovely hotel| the staff were fantastic| they arranged theatre and cinema tickets for us ready for our arrival. The breakfast is a boon| not had one provided by a NYC hotel before| and of course the cheese and wine pepped you before a night out. The location was ideal| a short stroll to the  Shake Shack which we would also recommend| both the meat and the veggie.,
46,Amazing,What a super hotel!  Staff are so friendly. My room was very large for New York.  Location was good.  Easy walk to Empire State Building| Macy's etc.  Loved the cheese and wine at night and the breakfast was ample plus coffee and tea available all day.  If you want a great room with helpful| friendly staff then stay here.  Perfect choice ,
15,My favorite NYC hotel - Hotel Giraffe,This hotel is remarkable - especially for the rates which are very reasonable.  The staff is amazing from door personnel to the front desk and the wonderful women who serve breakfast in the morning.  It's not many places you can get wine & cheese and breakfast included in the price of a room! We come to NYC frequently and love the location of the hotel| the staff and everything about it!,
2,Family friendly| but with class,I stumbled upon Hotel Giraffe from a Trip Advisor list of family-friendly hotels and wasn't disappointed.  At the same time| it was still a very nice boutique hotel that didn't feel at all like those chain hotels that usually get this classification.  The staff were so friendly to my kids. The rooms were large (we had a king and fold out sofa). The complimentary continental breakfast in the morning was very nice.  They will even let you pre-order breakfast the night before and deliver it to your room for only a small charge.  I found this very helpful since my kids are embarrassingly unruly sometimes in restaurants and preferred to eat breakfast in their PJs while watching cartoons.  Plus it meant the other hotel guests could enjoy breakfast and coffee in peace :)  All in all|…,
203,Lovely base for NYC,We had arranged to stay for our 25th year anniversary| and what an excellent choice. The only less than perfect note was on arrival - the rooms wasn't ready at 3pm| and we had to wait longer than we would have liked for our room (having travelled from Australia we were anxious to drop bags and settle it). But the room when we walked in was perfect| rose petals on the bed| chocolate covered strawberries| lovely. Manager Peter had apologised and offered us free cocktails at the restaurant next door| but in the end we didn't take him up on that - the fact of his courtesy was quite enough.  Great breakfast| lovely hotel. I'll be back.,
13,Amazing stay,I had an amazing stay at Hotel Giraffe. The room was great| warm (it is cold in New York this winter) and the staff were attentive and helpful. It is also good value because you get free wifi and an open bar (wine and cheese) each evening.  The Flatiron district is also convenient| accessible and interesting with a huge selection of restaurants.,
11,A wonderful place to stay...,Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly.  The included breakfast was delicious and a filling start to each day.  The rooms were nicely furnished| flawlessly cleaned| and sufficiently-sized.  No in-room microwave| but that's okay.  Bread and Tulips| the attached restaurant had delicious food (much of which could be ordered through room service).  The location is convenient to the subway's #6 line.  It's also an easy walk to Madison Square Park (not the same as Madison Square Garden)| the Museum of Math| and the Empire State Building.  (You walk right past the Museum of Sex en route to the Empire State Building| so that could be a plus or minus depending upon your perspective.). We had a wonderful visit to NYC and would likely stay here (or at another hotel in this group) if…,
41,I always stay at the giraffe,New York hotels are often achingly trendy| have tiny rooms| are over priced or all three. The giraffe is just a really unpretentious but very nice hotel| sweet staff| spacious rooms (for new York) and a really useful location. I come to new York at least once or twice a year and I just always stay at the giraffe. It just delivers. ,
10,Service| Service| Service with a smile!,We spent Christmas at the Hotel Giraffe| and it was wonderful in every way.  Great| central location| but not the frenzy of the Times Square area.  It was quiet.  For NYC our room felt spacious| and it was very well appointed.  We had floor to ceiling balcony windows that let in lots of light| and there was a blackout shade that operated electronically for sleeping in.  We had barely been in the room for 5 minutes when someone tapped on the door inquiring if we had everything we needed.  This attention to our needs continued for 4 days.  The “continental” breakfast in the lobby is the best I’ve ever had—frighteningly good croissants|  non-fat| plain (hard to find in hotels) greek yogurt| huge and fresh fruit bowl| cereals| pastries| bagels| hard-boiled eggs| large…,
2,This is quite a find!,Got the best Internet rate and when I got there was upgraded to a one bedroom suite (didn't even ask!). Great location| really nice staff| and the rooms are delightful (especially if you can score one of the suites). The munchies at breakfast and happy hour were perfect| filling| and yummy. This was my second stay and I will absolutely consider Hotel Giraffe on a future visit.,
13,Always a warm welcome,We were at the hotel during the first two weeks of January 2013| each day after a cold day in the city it was great to get a warm welcome - like coming home.  The hotel wqs comfortable| and quite centrally located for us.  We were able to walk to the likes of Times Square when we wanted to stretch our legs| but it was just as easy to jump on the subway| especially when we discovered there was a weekday entrance to the station just across the road.  Staff were extremely helpful and genuinely interested in our welbeing and activities.,
36,Tiny stuffy room was overpriced,My husband booked this as a romantic weekend getaway and we were really disappointed with the small dark room| given the price tag. It describes itself as luxury and boutique but I felt that would be a description suited to a style 10-15 years ago. I have stayed in new York and Japan on numerous occasions so understand space constraints and know I will spend a lot of time out enjoying the city| but for the price it wasn't the little retreat I wanted to come back to and enjoy. Breakfast was great and location ok.,
12,Loved it again!!,My husband & I stayed for a combined b'day getaway back in November. It is our 3rd time back. We arrived early and it was no problem to valet our car and go out & about for a while. We never received a phone call telling us our room was ready for check in| but no big deal since we were having fun walking around. Was surprised to find not one| but two bottles of wine waiting for us in our room when we got there! That was a nice touch! As always we enjoyed the wine & cheese reception in the lobby. Room was clean and bed was comfy. Staff was wonderful! Only complaint about our stay was that it was windy & cold in the city that day! Cant wait to go back!!,
9,A Great Stay!,We had 4 nights at the hotel giraffe in early January and this was a great hotel. The room was really lovely| with all toiletries supplied. The breakfast was really good and everything you could want from a continental breakfast| and the early evening wine and nibbles was great. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. I would recommend this hotel highly!,
3,Absolutely delightful!,We spent a long weekend last week at the Giraffe for the first time and could not have been more pleased! The entire staff without exception were gracious and helpful with a cheerful demeanor and the facility itself is wonderful. A great value and an oasis in the city!,
16,Good location|excellent staff,Very friendly and efficient staff.We have already recommended the hotel to friends intending to visit NYC.Drinks in the evening|a nice touch and an excellent way to start an evening.Location good for going uptown or downtown with a subway stop close by.,
42,Very nice and welcoming stay,My normal hotel in NYC was booked so I decided to try Hotel Giraffe as it was near to business that I had in the city.  I had stayed at their sister hotel (The Library) and enjoyed.  I was there with a collegue and when we arrived| his room was ready and mine was not.  They promissed the room soon and this was not a problem as we had some shopping to do| the room was ready when we returned about 30 minutes later.  The room was very nice| They put rose pedals on the bed for arrival| nice touch.  I had a small suite.  2 comments would be that the entrance to the suite/sitting area is a bit dark| and the bathroom showed a bit of wear in and around the shower.  Other than that the room was very well maintained.  I had a problem with the TVs which the engineer came very promptly and…,
1,Great place to stay,I was recommended the Giraffe hotel by friends and now can see why.  Great value - our room cost included breakfast which was fabulous| plus drinks at night| also very enjoyable. The staff could not do enough for us| the rooms were very comfortable and clean and we were close to everything. We could walk to many places or a cheap taxi ride.  We were there for 7 nights and really enjoyed our stay I will also be recommending the Giraffe Hotel,
1,Great Spot!,Sitting in the lobby early on a Sunday enjoying the breakfast they have out.  Clean| sleek| fun and pleasant place to stay.  Great robes!  Staff is beyond nice.  Overall| great place.  Will definite stay again! We came for nyc hotel week and got a great deal.  Close to Eataly and Madison Sq Park.  Nothing but good things to say.,
2,Great find,Stayed here for 5 nights after my boyfriend returned from serving in Iraq- great hotel| nice room- not huge but adequate size. Modern decor and very clean. Our room had a balcony- we enjoyed waking up and watching the yellow taxis rush beneath us.  Location was good although we did occassionaly jump in a taxi to save our legs! Would recommend!,
507,Our new favorite boutique  hotel,"Why even bother staying in a big chain hotel when you can have a hotel that feels like home. Upon check in| we arrived in time for the nightly wine/cheese reception - what a fantastic idea. When we got to our very large suite| a bottle of red wine was waiting for my ""birthday|"" another nice surprise. Loved the electric shades in the main room| our sofa bed| large inner room and beautiful bathroom and nice bathroom products. Each morning we took advantage of the NY sports club in the am and the hotel breakfast| another nice perk. We also appreciated the late check out (1pm). Everything worked - hot water (NICE)| chocolate on the bed for turndown - this felt like HOME in NYC. We prepaid our room and got a great deal. Helpful staff can't do enough to make your stay better.",
7,Giraffe always exceeds my expectations!,Everything about this hotel is 5 stars---and on the 5 or 6 times we've stayed there--it only gets better. Clean comfortable rooms---and constant attention to detail.Phone calls confirming your reservation/arrival the day before--and after check in they call to make sure everything is okay. Love the wine and cheese in the lobby every night from 5-8. Breakfast is superb from the fresh fruit to outstanding bagels and wonderful coffee. Hate to leave--actually.,
34,Excellent Hotel,We stayed at the Hotel for 5 days| it was picked because of the reviews and we were not disappointed. The staff are terrific they go out of their way to help you and are very friendly. The rooms are modern| well maintained| look good and are very well equipped although do not expect a huge room. The bed was comfortable with pillows that| for once in an hotel| are supportive for normal people allowing one to sleep without then waking up with neck ache. The bathroom is pleasant and has everything you need although I prefer a shower cubicle rather than a shower over the bath. The room has all the 'toys' you expect nowadays| DVD player| iPod dock etc. However| not being a 14 year old| instruction in how to access the 200 station TV would help!! The only downside is that street noise…,
17,The Giraffe was definitely not an elephant.,We spent nearly 3 weeks in The Giraffe Dec - January. It was a great little hotel with the extras ( Wifi| breakfast| wine and cheese ) making it even more value for money. They arranged transport to and from the airport and were happy to give advise as required. Location excellent. the staff were always chipper and very professional.The only criticism is the coffee / Tea . The water was never hot enough. There that is very small annoyance in what was a 9.5 / 10 stay.,
6,A hidden gem!,"I had three rooms booked at The Giraffe for my familly to enjoy another NYE in NYC| followed by a further 5 nights enjoying the city. Having visited New York on numerous occassions| and stayed in a variety of hotels| from 5 stars to 3| from up-town to mid and down| I can honestly say that The Giraffe gave us the best overall experience ever! Like a number of reviewers have pointed out| the establishment is not one of the ""well known"" brands and| from our experience I would say| long may that continue. The staff could not be more helpful| caring or considerate and every team member we came into contact with was an absolute star.  As well as the complimentary breakfasts / cheese and wine tastings| do not miss out on Bread & Tulips the restaurant annexed to the hotel; really fine…",
25,Very nice experience| would definitely return,We stayed at Hotel Giraffe for a week over New Year's.  Upon arrival| the restaurant was closed (10:10pm) but they directed us immediately to a deli a block away where take-away was easy for return to our room.  The lobby was smaller than it looked in the pictures| but very pleasant with snacks and hot drinks available.  Sometimes difficult to find a table for breakfast| but you can take a tray to your room.  It was very thoughtful that a family member could join us for breakfast.  The room was a fairly typical hotel room| but clean| pleasant and relatively quiet which is great in NYC.  The main noise was the dumpsters being emptied pretty much every day| varying from 4am to 6am.  The free Wifi and water is much appreciated - high end hotels charging for bottled water is a pet…,
84,Great place to stay in NYC,My wife and I stayed in NYC in December 2012 and chose Hotel Giraffe based on previous reviews and we weren't disappointed!  Location: Loads of places to eat nearby| and a good base to start from for many attractions. We opted to walk almost everywhere. At a standard pace it's roughly 45mins from Central Park (North end of the City) and 45mins from Wall Street (South end of the City). Macys| Madison Square Garden| Empire State are all close (less than 20 mins). It's a bit quieter near Madison Square Park| which we actually liked| as it's nice to come back to the hotel away from the hustle and bustle of the big attractions.  Room: We were originally going to book a suite| but instead opted for a balcony guestroom with one king bed - we thought we'd prefer a single large room than…,
55,lovely boutique hotel| central location,"Stayed at Hotel Giraffe for 3 nights in a double deluxe room with balcony.  Room was tastefully furnished and rate included continental breakfast of fresh pastries| diy toast| cereals| fruits and hot and cold beverages.  Located in Flatiron district| close to Eataly| an amazing italian gourmet foods deli/cafe/restaurant.  Also walking distance to Macy's (10 mins).   What I really liked was that the room was quiet as we stayed in Times Square for a week prior and got woken up every night there because of noise from the street. Room size - comfortable for our family of 3 adults or 2 adults and 2 younger children.  Might be a bit ""crowded"" if 4 adults sharing. Pros - quiet location| friendly staff and proximity to subway| restaurants and shopping. Cons- breakfast area was always…",
76,Great Place to Stay on New York City,The check-in was efficient and the staff were very kind and helpful.  The rooms were lovely.  We liked the balcony and the windows.  The staff comes by in the evening to turn down the bed| close the shade for the morning light and leave mints for the guests.  The room and bathroom were very clean.  The free wifi was a benefit| as was the breakfast in the morning.  We stayed at the Giraffe for two nights| on a Sat and Sun.  Because it was after the holidays| we received a very good rate for a hotel in New York City.  And we were very pleased with our choice of hotel  I would definitely recommend The Giraffe Hotel.  It is centrally located| clean| free wifi| free breakfast and a wine and cheese reception for three hours in the evening.  You will not be disappointed.,
18,Great Hotel and Location. Professional Staff,My girlfriend and I stayed one night at The Hotel Giraffe at the end of December.  We were greeted and welcomed to the hotel by very professional front desk staff.  They informed us of the food and activities offered in the lobby.  Our room was located on the fourth floor| facing 26th street. The room was beautifully decorated| extremely clean| and modern.  The bathroom was well lit and offered plenty of space.  Good closet and dresser space.  Our favorite detail of the room was the floor to ceiling glass doors that open up to a small private balcony.    The hotel offers a nice cold breakfast in the morning with plenty of cereal and bagels. After we checked out| we left our baggage with the hotel staff for the entire day.    My only complaint is that the street noise was loud|…,
153,Recommended this over and over,What an amazing experience. I stayed at another NYC hotel immediately prior to my stay here. What a difference. From the hotel staff who was helpful at all times of the day to help you with direction| get show tickets or even with a tray to take breakfast up to your room to the location - close but not too close to major attractions - this is a great place. The complimentary beverage station and continental breakfast is so convenient. The wine and cheese in the afternoon is a nice touch - although I was never around to take part. The rooms are quite large compared to others I've stayed in in NYC. I've recommended the Hotel Giraffe to several of my friends who in turn have recommended to their friends. We all agree| this is the place to stay.,
220,A very fine hotel,A very fine hotel| without any air of stuffiness; deserving of its top ratings in trip advisor. I travelled solo and loved the opportunity to mingle with other guests at the evening 'wine and cheese' reception. I was upgraded to a one bedroom suite for the first night of my stay| owing to the fact that a room move was required of me. Though the move itself was a nuisance (had to wait to re-check back into a room on my 2nd consecutive night| even though i'd been assured i'd be in the same room for the whole stay)| the upgrade was a luxurious bonus. My suite was so beautifully appointed i delayed settling in so as not to muss things up!! Luxurious bed and loads of pillows and turn down service a lovely bonus. Special note to the front desk agent| paulina or simona?? (blonde|…,
1,Hotel Giraffe Excellent Experience,The hotel staff was really accommodating and made our stay feel special. Because we were celebrating birthdays| there were rose petals scattered on our bed| spa music playing in our room| chocolate dipped strawberries| bottle of decent red wine waiting upon our arrival --- all complimentary.  Hypoallergenic bedding| complimentary wine| cheese| appetizers in the evening and hearty continental breakfast in the morning and a 1pm check out time made the experience that much more wonderful... will definitely return.,
8,Was a perfect stay,We stayed there 3 nights in a 1 bedroom suite. They had a good continental breakfast and cookies and coffee all day long. They also serve cheese and wine in the early evening hours| although I personally did not get a chance to taste it. We were here for medical reasons and needed breakfast packed for us at 6:00 am and the hotel staff did it for us. They have rental movies downstairs and is very clean and comfortable. Prefer this to the hotel Pierre| because of the homey feeling and cleanliness. Tulips and bread and the mexican restaurant next door was superb as well.,
2,Perfect!!,My husband and I spent such a long time searching for the best hotel for our stay in NYC....we wanted somewhere slightly away from noise and hustle of Times Square and also a location where we could explore downtown  as well as midtown/uptown. This hotel was perfect!!! Subway is a 2 minute stroll away. Plenty of taxis also passing by was great.  Rooms were very clean| staff were very helpful| breakfast was a perfect way to start the day as well as the complimentary wine and cheese with a pianist in the evening. The music which was being played really made you feel as though you were sitting in a quaint movie set in New York!  Loved loved loved it and would definitely stay here again! :)  Loved that a New York time out was in our bedroom which gave us ideas where to go| from top…,
1,Highly recommended,I stayed in a 1 bedroom terrace suite for 5 days and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The staff were outstanding in their friendliness and willingness to assist in every way possible. Everything was super clean| even over the Christmas holiday season. The evening drinks and nibblies are a real plus. I used the AirLink shuttle from Newark Airport and was dropped/picked up from the hotel door - very convenient.,
345,Stick your neck out for this Giraffe,My two night stay at the Hotel Giraffe was excellent from start to finish.  Though a frequent visitor to NYC| I was unfamiliar with the area of Park Avenue South at 26th where this hotel is located.  What I feared might be a slightly out of the way location turned out to be very central for accessing various subway lines| Madison Square Park (Shake Shack!  Eataly!)| and even for strolling uptown or the Village.  The lobby is a modern| high-ceilinged affair with contemporary| but cozy| furnishings| including a coffee| tea and snack buffet that is out all day when the (complimentary) breakfast and wine and cheese services are not being offered.  In other words| snacks and drinks available 24hrs a day.  I love this feature| found at sister property the Library Hotel as well| as it…,
21,Fantastic hotel with great atmosphere and location.,Hotel Giraffe was recomended to us by friends who themselves are returning again later this month| what a fantastic find. Loved the smallest of the hotel| and the staff were friendly but not fake| really helpful as a matter of course rather than an obligation. Our room was lovely| modern fresh and clean and all the electrical gadgets you could desire (ipod docking| dvd| music etc etc). The couple of minor issues we had were resolved quickly and efficiently| and the staff were so apologetic| genuinely. Loved the evening drinks and breakfast| a lovely touch easpcially for those of us that are not used to the big American breakfast. Fantastic location| with an abundance of restaurants outside of the usual chains| great subway access and walking was easy too. What else can I say|…,
44,Amazing hotel| first class service| brilliant location,Where do I start with reviewing this gem of a hotel in Manhattan...  As soon as we arrived in a taxi from JFK airport we were greeted with a very warm welcome. Doors opened| cases taken from us. The hotel lobby is lovely| not too big like some of these 5 star resorts| it felt homely| warm and welcoming. Asim from Reception checked us in and chatted to us whilst he went through the process| very smiley and welcoming us to New York. Phoebe was on Reception too| again making us feel very welcome. An additional bonus was that our suite was ready and it was only 1pm. We were taking to our suite by one of the staff and he chatted to us about the area| the hotel and showed us the amenities in the room| he opened the terrace doors| it was cold but snowing| he talked to us about where…,
10,Good Stay,Stayed over Christmas and New Year. The rooms were clean and modern albeit on the small side| although apparently that is normal for NYC. Staff were friendly and always helpful. The hotel is close to the subway and you can even walk to some of the main attractions if you like. It is in a nice quite location| especially after the holiday crowds near all the tourist attractions. The only downside is the breakfast area which is quite small and guests regularly had to wait for a table| although you can always have it delivered to your room or take a tray and take the food to your room yourself.,
42,Great Hotel| Great Position,Stayed in 2 rooms (side by side w common door) w 3 kids and 2 adults. Excellent sized rooms esp considering that we spent XMas there. Breakfast included which was nice considering it was freezing outside. Only complaint was that we paid a premium to stay there Xmas week but for 3 of the nights there the attached restaurant wasn't open and thus no room service either. This was the only detraction. Otherwise perfect base for exploring all that New york has to offer. Close to subway| short walk to Flatiron Building and Union Square,
1,Perfect hotel for NY break,The giraffe is a great boutique hotel - excellent service with good sized rooms. Breakfast is relaxed with lovely pastries and bagels. The cheese and wine every evening was a great addition. The staff are really accommodating and happy to help with arranging car hire or recommending restaurants. We had a fantastic stay here over Christmas and would highly recommend . ,
7,Immaculate Hotel and a great service.,We arrived at The Giraffe feeling slightly jaded after a long journey but were immediately impressed by the place. Very friendly and helpful staff and an immaculate room. Everyone asks for a room on a higher floor but we ended up on the 3rd. Don't worry| the noise from the street is massively reduced by the balcony doors and the nearby lift didn't disturb us at all. A visit to New York (if you want to soak it all up) means that you won't spend much time in your room but The Giraffe is a lovely oasis to recharge your batteries. The provision of a buffet breakfast was very welcome and allowed us to have at least one helathy meal each day! Cheese and wine in the afternoon was again a nice touch but we were on the move too much to take much advantage. Have a burger in The Shake…,
784,Little gem to keep to oneself,Just returned from our bi annual stay @ HG. Q what's not to like.  Positives: great location for uptown & downtown| managers reception with wonderful nibbles & unlimited wine (being Brit this is a huge appeal:-))| complimentary breakfast| fruit available all day| rooms comfy & quiet (last visit was 701) turn down service nice touch| fridge in room useful for 2 week stay| really accommodating staff & management (even offering to get hold of & buy robe for me on their US account!) customer service second to none| DVD collection available| relaxed atmosphere| pianist in evenings| unpretentious guests| free wifi| free access to NYSC| complimentary anniversary gift...the list is endless.  Negatives (difficult but here goes): agree with review below- tv nightmare to understand how to…,
2,Thoroughly recommended Hotel| especially for a family with young children.,We stayed at Hotel Giraffe from the 22nd to the 26th December.  Our entire stay was perfect.  We have two children| 4 & 7| and stayed in room 1101.  The location is peaceful and convenient.  Madison Square Park is just a short walk away| as is Flatiron| Empire State Building| Union Square Garden| a 24-hour Pharmacy for all of your family's needs.  The room was immaculate and the living area with sofa bed & satellite TV for the children was perfect.  The Subway is just over the road (downtown) and two blocks up the road next to McDonalds (uptown).  When you're in a City with so much to do and with so many places to explore| all you want is a safe| clean| friendly| comfortable and economical place to stay; Hotel Giraffe fits that bill perfectly.  One morning at around 4 am another…,
1,Wonderful Hotel,No doubt this was an experience of a Lifetime. I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel. Kudos to the staff !!! The staff was welcoming. Ambience was very nice an food was good. I will visit this hotel again.,
14,Great Find in NYC,We are a family of 4 and stayed for 4 nights at the HG just before christmas.  The staff were very friendly| helpful and gave the hotel a personal touch not found in larger hotels.  The complimentary breakfast and evening drinks were just what busy and tired travellers need to start and finish the day.  The rooms were well appointed and of a high standard.  For being a city hotel it was quiet. The free WI-FI is a bonus. Would definitely stay at Hotel Giraffe again and highly recommend it to any prospective traveller wanting accommodation in a midtown location.,
82,The Best Hotel in New York,This is my favorite hotel in NY for the price.  The neighborhood is great.  They serve a huge buffet continental breakfast every morning with fresh pastries| eggs| fruit| yogurt| coffee| etc and have a happy hour every evening with champagne| wine and a beautiful selection of cheeses| fruit| crackers and veggies.  It's very clean and modern with free internet in the lobby and wifi in the room.  They also have a turn down service.  Really a treat to stay here.  My fear is it will become too popular!,
30,A Hidden Gem,We stayed at HG shortly before Christmas in a top-floor suite - it was just wonderful. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful| the complimentary breakfast and snacks during the day and wine and cheese in the evening were a lovely bonus and the hotel's restaurant| Bread & Tulips| provided some delicious food for two weary travellers| both on our first night and when over-indulgence got the better of us and a night of room service seemed a good idea! It is also the first hotel I have ever booked in NYC that gave me a very quiet night's sleep. We booked early and received a discount for paying in advance| which made this superb value for such a well-located midtown hotel. I cannot fault this hotel and will definitely be staying again.,
12,Great place in midtown!,This is an excellent midtown hotel.  We traveled as a family and loved the location| rooms| and helpful staff.  The continental breakfast was generous with fresh fruit| fresh squeezed juice| and pastries.  A bonus was the complementary afternoon wine and cheese.  We will definitely be back!,
34,Great,This hotel certain deserves its fantastic rating! Great rooms| great staff| and a very comfortable stay! The location is great as well| far enough away from the buzz that keeps you from sleeping| but close enough to walk everywhere! We didn't catch any public transport and visited Statue of Liberty| Central Park etc! Would come back in a heartbeat!,
1,Best Hotel Stay Ever!,My husband and I stayed at your hotel in August.  Location| staff| room amenities - everything far exceeded our expectations.  I recommend your hotel to family and friends.  Will definitely stay again!!!              ,
236,My new favorite hotel in Manhattan...,Thanks to lower prices during the last few days just before Christmas I was able to finally stay at the Hotel Giraffe. It is a boutique hotel in the Gramercy Park area of New York and not at all touristy.  In fact| it feels like a small hotel in Paris.    The hotel staff are outstanding and very warm and friendly. When I asked about the architecture in the area the manager showed me photos of the area from the early 1900s and gave me a brief history lesson--very informative.  The rooms are chic and beautifully decorated with lovely photographs dressing the walls.  Beds are comfortable and linens are new and fresh looking.    The included breakfast is ample and served in the hotel's small| but cozy lobby. It includes toast| bagels| croissants| muffins| yogurts| fresh fruits|…,
12,Exceeded expectations|......once again.,Celebrated my wife's 50th with a 3 nighter in NYC. This was our 2nd visit to Hotel GIraffe in 4 years. Love the location; close to subway station| and center of the City. This property has all the lux and high end features without the pretense. The rooms are large| big windows| some with balconies| great beds & linens. The lobby area is a social place that offers continental breakfast in the AM and wine & cheese in the PM| oh how civilized. The highlite for me is the staff; engaging| caring and committed to their guests experience. There is no arrogance or pretense amouongst them and no  tip expectations. We will be back next time NYC calls. Thank you staff at HG.,
51,Family of four weekend in the Big Apple.,We booked a one bedroom suite| which was a good size| and it included a pull-out queen sofa| coming in handy for our two children. The hotel seems relatively new and is on the corner of Park Ave & 26th St.| a location we found convenient. We arrived well after the 3PM check-in time to find our room unavailable| but prompt attention from the personable GM| Peter Velk| remedied the situation. We liked our room| although the bathroom was a bit different| with a large rippled glass window in the door - still very private although permitting light to shine through the window into the darkened hall and parlor room at night; a bit annoying to others. Our room rate included the breakfast bar| which occupies the entire lobby each morning. Reminded us of a Marriott Courtyard set-up|…,
33,The only Hotel to stay in the Big Apple,An absolute gem of a hotel in New York City. The staff made us feel very welcome at this small hotel and we received a complimentary upgrade to a room with a small balcony overlooking Park Avenue. We were celebrating my wife's birthday and were welcomed to our room with a chilled bottle of prosecco and two huge cupcakes. Room was very spacious and very comfortable and very clean. Even although it was cold outside the room was always nice and cosy. Turn down service at nights along with chocolates was a very nice touch which was a nice welcome after a long day going about NYC. Breakfast in the mornings was excellent and the waiting staff were very polite and friendly. We experienced the cheese and wine on only one occasion and it went down a treat. The concierge was first class|…,
6,Another delightful stay,Just returned from a long weekend in to visit our daughter in NYC. We stayed at the Hotel Giraffe as it is close to her apartment. The hotel is modern| small and quiet. As with it's sister hotel the Elysee ( which I also strongly recommend if you want to stay midtown) they put on a very nice spread for breakfast...hot and cold cereals| various sweet rolls| bagels| fresh fruit| juices| hard boiled eggs| yogurts etc| with a very busy espresso machine; this as well as a delightful wine and cheese etc spread in the late afternoon is included with the room. Very European| which is probably why both hotels have a lot of European clientele. The rooms are very well appointed and quiet. The staff is well trained and a pleasure to deal with. The rates are reasonable for the room and…,
91,Worth it.,Wonderful hotel in lower midtown.  We have stayed in a number of different hotels| upper east| midtown| downtown| near the battery| and the Giraffe ranks in the top two (the other being a very expensive suite at the Sherry-Neatherland.)   The hotel is small by NYC standards but the quality was large. Great room (gigantic by NYC standards). Great Breakfast. Great Service. Great wine & Cheese reception.  Great location with multiple transportation options.,
3,Excellent Stay,I can't say enough about the staff and accomodations at the Hotel Giraffe!!  Friendly| helpful| courteous| and knowledgeable staff.  We were always greeted with great smiles and attitudes and they were always ready to help.  Complementary breakfast was great as was the afternoon wine and cheese.  After a busy evening it was very nice to have a cup of hot chocolate or coffee (available anytime) in the relaxing lobby and unwind.  Rooms were large| clean| and nicely decorated (great pillows too). Great location.  I would highly recommend the Hotel Giraffe.  I will certainly be staying there again on my next visit to the Big Apple!!,
61,Ecelleent Hotel.,We went to the Giraffe Hotel because we couldn’t get into the Casablanca hotel which we had stayed in some years ago and the Giraffe Hotel was in the same group. We pre-booked and got a good rate. The room was excellent-twice the size of the room in the Casablanca hotel. The continental breakfast was included in the price and was quite adequate. What was really good was the coffee and cake/cookies being available at any time in the lobby. In addition the hotel provided wine and cheese in the evening in the lobby. The lobby itself was spacious and comfortable. The location of the hotel| about 10 blocks south of Grand Central| was fine. Numerous taxes ran up and down on Park Avenue South and the subway stops were within 2 or 3 minutes walk. The guys on the hotel reception were…,
3,wonderful staff,we just returned from a great Christmas trip to New York and had a wonderful time..this hotel is the best..friendly| small| clean| with each and every staff member special...especially Simone who helped make our daughter's stay even better with a surprise gift ..loved this hotel before| and even better this time ..Brian | Sheila and Karen,
11,Lovely hotel| just a slightly marred experience.,I'd been in New York for a few weeks| staying at an apartment I'd booked on airbnb| and decided to have just the one night at a really great hotel (little treat to myself). I decided to stay here because of all the great reviews but was pretty let down in the end unfortunately.   I'd booked in for a stay on a Sunday night| which I really do think is probably not the greatest idea. The adjoining restaurant which I'd heard good things about is closed on a Sunday| also they don't do the socializing cheese and wine in the foyer on a Sunday (something they do mention on the website| I know| so ultimately that's my bad)| but still| if it's a feature of your hotel and something you take pride in| it's just odd to not have it on a Sunday. If I were to come back to treat myself again OR…,
13,Just Perfect,We stayed here on a trip from Australia for my husband's 50th birthday| having read many positive reviews on TripAdvisor.  I really can't say enough about the place and the staff - our trip was fabulous.  I already miss my coffee & bagel for breakfast and my wine & cheese in the evening!  The room was clean| comfortable and stylish.  Service was lovely and the location is perfect.  I was so glad we were away from the more touristy parts of town.  The subway is a 90 second walk away and from there you can be anywhere in about 10 minutes.  The staff were friendly and helpful and it really did feel like home for the 10 days we were there.  We will definitely stay again if we return to NYC.,
18,Last minute getaway,Booked this hotel recently for a one night stay in NYC (unbeknownst to me the weekend of Santa Con 2012) through Hotel Tonight.  Went ahead to book it based on the reviews here on TA| was definitely not disappointed.  Front desk staff was friendly and courteous| and the premises were clean| well-lit| and in a great location.  Loved all the perks| such as complimentary bottled water in the room| wine and cheese in the evenings| and continental breakfast with great hours.  2 blocks away from the 6 line train helped with transportation| and the staff was more than willing to hold our bags after we checked out and explored the city a little longer.  Stayed on the 3rd floor| so we had a nice view of Park Ave| with the noise not being too obtrusive.  The king bed was massive and had…,
71,Exceeded all expectations . . .,My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel having read previous comments on trip advisor and as the title says| it certainly lived up to  all the positive comments. The hotel was in a prime location just a few blocks from the Empire State and Times Square. We stayed in room 902 which was on the 9th floor and was high enough that street noise from traffic was hardly heard. The room was spacious| well furnished and very comfortable which was just what was required after a full day of shopping and sightseeing. The staff were always very cheerful and very helpful and at all times very professional. Having breakfast in the morning was good with plenty of choices and in the evening| the wine and cheese and crudités was a nice way to either end the day or start the evening. Since…,
28,Beautiful hotel with great staff,I travelled with my family to NYC for a week in December and we had such a great time in hotel giraffe. The rooms were lovely and the complimentary bottles of water each day were a nice touch. The breakfast was good and although the coffee machine was temperamental black coffee was still available. My sister and I are big sex and the city fans and were very happy to hear that the penthouse of the giraffe was mr big's apartment in the first movie. One of the front desk staff took us up to see it which was very kind of him. I highly recommend the hotel also for its location which meant it wasnt too far to anywhere. ,
115,Friendliest hotel,Our stay in this hotel was enjoyable from the first day until the last. All the staff were extremely friendly and always took the time to ask how we were and if they could do anything. Nothing was too much trouble and all was done with us in mind| with a smile on their face| and not with their hand out. They also worked together to make our stay pleasant. If the doorman was free and noticed an empty table with dirty dishes| they would come over and clear the table in order to help out the other staff. The room we had was the Queen balcony suite which was large and airy with a nice balcony that you could stand on and look out. The furnishings were first class with chairs and tables| a large TV and ample wardrobe space. My only suggestion would be to put in King size beds next…,
51,Giraffe stands tall,Chose the Giraffe on a recent NYC visit on the basis of other T.A. reviews and was not disappointed.   A small boutique hotel| very different experience from the large brand names like Hilton| Marriott| etc.   Absolutely first class service|  complementary continental breakfast| wine and cheese every afternoon| coffee| cookies|etc available 24 hours.   Rooms large by NYC standards| probably average otherwise| very well done and comfortable.   We had a balcony queen on the 10th floor| right across from the elevator but never heard a thing.  Dont know what the other rooms are like but this one was fine.   Location not quite the middle of midtown but a little quieter as a consequence| 2 short blocks from the subway which is the way to get around NY.   Learn how to use it if you…,
13,A great place to stay on the East side,My wife and I recently stayed at Hotel Giraffe for the first time and were pleasantly pleased.  The hotel has 72 rooms| all corner rooms are suites.  It is located in the Gramercy neighborhood| at 26th and Park| near excellent restaurants| Union Square| the Flatiron building| Washington Square Park (which includes a Shake Shack - similar to In and Out Burger on the west coast. Their morning continental breakfast and evening happy hour are fun and appreciated.  Our room faced Park Avenue| but we were not bothered by noise.  The room (we did not have a suite) | was nicely appointed and of adequate size with nice and modern bathrooms.Staff was friendly and metro station nearly.,
17,Peaceful| Pleasant...Perfect!,My husband and I booked The Hotel Giraffe based on the reviews we read| and all the glowing remarks were absolutely true.  The hotel was centrally located - we walked just a few blocks to the subway multiple times throughout the week and headed to all points in NY from our quiet Park Ave. South and 26th location.  Upon entering our room we saw a nice bottle of wine and a card wishing us a happy 20th anniversary.  The hotel service was superb| and there was always someone there to answer questions| help with directions| offer restaurant recommendations| etc.  The Happy Hour from 5-8 each evening was delightful!  Great offerings of wine| champagne| cheeses| veggies| nuts| etc.  There was a pianist playing lovely music as we sipped our champagne.  We felt like we were in an upscale…,
72,Great Value for NY,Great hotel with free wifi| breakfast and all day coffee.Free wine and cheese at 5pm Metro line 6 was 100yds away Within easy walking distance of Union Sq|Madison Sq Gdn and the Empire State. Staff very helpful. Rooms very bright and comfortable.,
3,First time in NY from Australia,We stayed 5 nights in the hotel having travelled from Australia to attend a conference in Philadelphia. We took the opportunity to stay (first time) in NY and see the sites. The hotel facilities and all staff were terrific. Nothing was too much trouble for all of the staff and management we dealt with. Any future trip we will certainly be wanting to stay at the Giraffe again ... 10/10 !!!!,
49,Class,This hotel exemplifies NYC style and class.  Convenient location (walking distance to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station) not far from Empire State Building and of course hundreds of restaurants and bars...don't forget 2nd Ave Deli.  Staff were friendly and professional.  The rooms were a bit small but that's fine with me!,
20,best hotel in town!,booked The Giraffe for my birthday treat to me| and couldnt have made a better choice! Attentive staff| spotlessly clean| couldnt have been more helpful| free breakfast every morning| free bottled water daily| wine and cheese in the evening to socialise with other guuests if you wanted to| room service amazing. Could go on and on| but think youve guessed I had an amazing experience with them. Worth every penny,
3,Amazing friendly service even through Hurricane Sandy!,My husband stays at Hotel Giraffe every time he visits NY and the children and I join him every October. The hotel is in a great position| a quick walk to lots of good restaurants and shopping. The staff are all incredibly friendly and helpful. The girls at breakfast (which is a very good choice of fruit| yoghurt| eggs| bagels| pastries| cereals and more) are really lovely| always smiling and ready to help with coffee| toast or anything you ask. The complimentary cheese and wine every evening in the lobby is an incredibly generous touch| very relaxing  and a great way to start your evening. Rooms are spacious and clean| beds are comfortable and bathrooms are excellent. Cannot fault this hotel and the cheerful staff serving dinner from room service during Hurricane Sandy were…,
44,An enjoyable surprise,We chose the Giraffe as it was within walking distance from my daughter's apartment.  We were treated royally for the week we stayed.  I would highly recommend Hotel Giraffe to anyone wanting to feel like they are living in New York.,
17,Thanksgiving in NYC,Our Thanksgiving(family of four) visit in New York City was made even better by the Hotel Giraffe. All the positive reviews were right on target.  This was our last stop on an eight day tour of colleges along the east coast. Needless to say| we were tired and my husband and I were ready for some R & R.  Our first night at the hotel| we went to our room and a bottle of wine and chocolates were waiting as a welcome gift!  When we decided last minute to go see a show| the concierge gave us a great website and we were able to get tickets just 2 hours before show for a great price (8 rows from the stage!!)     The beds were very comfortable| rooms were quiet and we had a balcony so we could crack the door for some cold|fresh air at night.  It was fabulous!   The wine and champagne in…,
4,Terrific hotel all the way around,While we had lived near NYC for thirty years we were not familiar with this Park Ave. S. area.  We chose this hotel because it was convenient for business. We were more than pleasantly surprised by the hotel and the neighborhood. We loved the quiet lobby with lots of places to relax| read the paper or have a cup of complimentary coffee or glass of wine in the evening. The furnishings are tasteful and well maintained in both the lobby and the guest rooms.  We had a queen room with ample space| a well appointed bathroom and even a balcony.  The staff is friendly and professional.  We enjoyed returning to this lovely| comfortable hotel each evening.,
8,A hotel that goes extra mile when the chips are down,I stayed at Hotel Giraffe over the period of Sandy.  First before we arrived from UK we received a call checking arrival time and details.  Second the Hotel noticed that both my wife and I were having an anniversary so provided FOC an upgrade and chocolates and wine on arrival.  What service.  First class.  Then Sandy struck no power and initially no water| then no hot water.  The team led by Peter were great.  Nothing was too much trouble they even managed to keep breakfast available.  As ever a bit more lateral thinking could have offered more| but given the context the team did fantastic.  Would I stay again Yes! Yes! Yes!,
14,Tons of space!,I typically stay in a Soho boutique hotel while in NY but had the opportunity to try the Giraffe and was amazed by the service and space.  The lobby doesn't do the rooms justice| once I stepped into my room| it was huge!  A full living area| hallway as well as a big bedroom made me feel like I was in the comfort of my own home.  The complimentary breakfast of cereal| hard boiled eggs| fresh fruit and selection of breads and coffee was amazing and evening wine/cheese was delicious and such an added benefit for staying at the hotel.  I would recommend to anyone traveling to NY.,
4,A great hotel - great location| friendly staff| beautiful room,Stayed here on a recent trip to NY for 4 nights. Saw it had got great reviews and hotel didn't disappoint. Staff are friendly and helpful| room was very impressive (we stayed in a room with a queen size bed). Room essentially had a separate lounge area with nice sofa and huge plasma tv| and armchair. Also DVD/cd player. Bedroom decent size| also with tv and iPod docking station. Room was quiet considering we were overlooking park ave south. Continental breakfast good - also facilities in lounge on ground floor to make drinks etc during the day. And finally free cheese and wine in lounge every evening between 5-8. Overall a great stay in a great hotel. Would recommend this place to anyone and would definitely stay here again.,
118,Quaint| modern| wonderful,We love this hotel.  We've stayed at one of it's sister hotels| the Élysées and also love it.  We tried this one only to experience a different part of the city.  We have not been disappointed.  Great fresh breakfast with fresh fruit| cereal| skim as well as regular milk which is an extra bonus for me(can't always get it)| juice| coffee| bananas| mini muffins| and more.  As well we have taken part in the wine and cheese every night so far-really enjoyed the service| atmosphere| amenities| just fabulous.  Can't say enough good things about this hotel.  Oh yeah and for the rooms| lots of counter space in the bathroom| turn down service (good dark chocolates!)| fast wifi| very nice staff everywhere (from front desk to housekeeping to the wonderful ladies serving wine and…,
1,NGWeinberger,Absolutely marvelous experience; my single Queen came w a suite| wonderful desks; computer hook ups and plenty of outlets  For charging iPads and cell phones; lovely breakfast| snacks and wines w crudités and cheese in evening; feels as if one I'd in an exclusive private condo- will always use this hotel- comfort in everyway. Bath spacious and  several magnifying mirrors.,
37,First Class Establishment,"Unfortunately we haven't gotten to stay here yet| but I wanted to share that the Hotel Giraffe is a first rate operation. Due to an unforeseen medical situation| we had to cancel our ""uncancellable"" reservations at the last minute. The manager promptly called my husband back and allowed us to cancel the entire stay without charge. What a pleasant surprise to see folks who are compassionate and understanding. I hope very soon we can stay at HG.",
7,Great....everything!,We visited the week before Sandy.  We were lucky to enjoy fabulous sunshine| central location and excellent service.  The staff were attentive and everything was to a high standard.    Would highly recommend this hotel.,
7,Hurricane Sandy arrived while we were here. The mark of excellence service!,First let me preface I NEVER give reviews online so you know that the service must have been pretty spectacular to sit down and write this.  We were in NYC and decided to stay here based on the rave reviews. Location was great| room clean and huge and service impeccable. Little did we know we would be caught up in Hurricane Sandy while we were there. The staff was calm and extremely responsive.. generators kept the elevators going. Highly recommend this hotel. You won't be disappointed.,
1,Just perfect...No complaints,We stayed here November of 2009. Brought my boyfriend (now fiancé) here for his birthday. The service was pure perfection. I loved the French doors which opened to the balcony. Beautiful| well-appointed| nice bathroom. The staff helped make my boyfriend's birthday memorable by bringing up a cake that I had delivered from a local bakery. The moment your cab pulls up| you are greeted by staff who opens your door. They hailed us a cab when we needed one as well. Great service overall. I highly recommend this hotel.,
5,Service Extraordinaire and Windows that Open,"The greatest assets going for the Hotel Giraffe are it's staff.  Every person that we met went out of their way to make you feel welcome.  The included European breakfast was a unique and enjoyed cut above the standard ""make your own waffle"" format found in many hotels today.  The included cocktail reception hosted some of the best wines| including sparkling| and selection of cheeses that we have ever encountered at a hotel ""happy hour"".  The rooms are spacious and fun with LOTS of natural light that flows in through large windows that actually open so you can enjoy an abundance of fresh air.  We were in one of the suites with a balcony over Park Avenue and loved having coffee while enjoying the sights| sounds and smells of a very active downtown New York area.  As our trips to…",
18,absolutely perfect hotel,I have recently returned from a 10 day stay at Hotel Giraffe with my husband and believe me when I say this hotel is just perfect. I have previously stayed West of Times Square and the location of this hotel| just near Madison Square Park is fantastic. So much to do around the hotel and a lovely vibe. The staff are so lovely and accommodating| nothing is too much trouble. We had a king room and it is great| only thing we could possibly say it lacks is more hooks. But if that is the only thing you can find to fault| well you get my drift! Love the balconies| love the wine reception| breakfasts are great (although hard to get a seat most mornings)| love the comp coffee| (so hard to get a good coffee in NYC)| Beds are amazing! The restaurant attached is also very good. Can't wait…,
5,Outstanding service!,"We recently stayed at the Hotel Giraffe in Manhattan for my birthday.  From the moment we arrived| we were treated like VIPs  by everyone--from the Manager to the doormen.  Our King room was upgraded to a suite without even asking!  The complimentary lobby breakfasts were delightful (BEST cappucino) as was the cocktail hour with live piano music| and daylong munchies.  And the neighborhood is full of delights| as well as being convenient.  Although I wish it were less expensive| the Giraffe was a great ""home base"" for our visit.",
5,Exceptional boutique hotel,Everything about the hotel is delightful: the staff| the room| the lobby amenities and the location. It is clean and modern. One of the best touches is that the room had a small balcony that opened onto the street. The room was nice-sized for NYC and generous appointed (flat screen| iPod dock| comfortable bed/linens| bathroom| etc). I will most definitely stay at Hotel Giraffe again.,
101,Sweet!,Hotel Giraffe is in the best part of NYC- walkable to Grand Central| the Village so many nice dining options around.  Once inside| you're in comfort and kick up your heels because there's always treats in the lobby; i.e. cookies| drinks and even wine and cheese with fantastic jazz from 6-9.  My room was well appointed with nice ammenities such as robes| umbrellas| wine glasses and even a mini-fridge. Turn down service was a treat with lullabye music| the shade drawn and a few chocolates.   The Giraffe will be my NYC home from now on!,
5,Weekend Stay at Hotel Giraffe,Hotel Giraffe was a lovely place to stay for our weekend in the Big Apple.  From the moment we arrived we were looked after so well by the hotel team.  This is a lovely small| quiet and intimate hotel where jazz music is played in the main lobby which also contained a piano where a pianist performed in the early evening whilst we the guests indulged in the complimentary cheese and wine| how very civilised!  Our room was spacious with a balcony and tastefully decorated with slippers and bathrobe available for use| how wonderful.  We also must mention the fabulous breakfast which was also complimentary| fresh bagels; bread; pastries; fresh fruit cocktail and cereal and yoghurts| what else could we ask for. Close to central Manhattan and a short walk to the subway.  Highly…,
14,Excellent Hotel| Highly Recommended,My daughter and I stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for 4 nights to celebrate her special birthday.  We had a wonderful time in New York and this hotel is exceptional.  We could not fault the hotel at all. We each had our own room with a balcony which was lovely and had everything we could possible need.  The bathroom was well equipped with luxurious towels| toiletries etc.  It was kept spotlessly clean.  The buffet breakfast was delicious with a good variety of tasty food.  The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel had a very personal feel about it| unlike larger hotels which can be rather impersonal. We did feel that the breakfast area in the lounge would benefit by having more tables but we always managed to find somewhere to sit so it was not too much of a problem.  We…,
157,Beautiful,This is a beautifully appointed and spacious hotel. The decore is very hip and modern. Free wi-fi| tea and cookies and wine and cheese is a real plus! Rooms are not very well soundproofed but not too bad. ,
2,NYer or not| good spot!,Friendly staff| great non tourist trap restaurants in the vicinity and access to whatever you need. I recommend this place to those that want to experience NYC but don't want cookie cutter chain hotels. Great for business travel too.,
2,Great Location!,Hotel Giraffe is in a great| safe location.  Although more expensive than some other nice options we had| we have no complaints.  Stayed 4 nights in Oct and the staff were great.  Room was good size for New York.  The only issue we had was that the roof top bar and outdoor area was closed down for repair and you could not experience that.  It is one of the reasons we choose the hotel over another and feel like we should have been told in advance it would not be available since we had reservations a few months out.  It would have been appropriate for a slight discount on our stay since all amenities were not available to us.  We would LOVE to visit again!,
3,Generally Good dining  room to small and information flows not good and incurred parking fine :(,+ Food and wine + breakfast very fresh _ not enough seating in dining room large piano in middle of room and during busy periods if your not early you will find yourself either standing or eating your food on your lap!,
160,***** when you get a great deal!,I found Hotel Giraffe on the HotelTonight app| it wasn't the least expensive option| but for a one-time splurge| it turned out to be perfect. When you NEED to be in downtown-midtown Manhattan| then you're going to pay for the privelege| no two ways about it. The location is a little south of the main Times Square/Broadway activities| but the subway and taxis will get you where you're going in short order.  The room decor is warm and urban all at once. Even without a balcony| you get a great view out upon E 26th Street and looking down Park Ave| pretty cool. When you see Park Ave all lined up with bright yellow cabs| you know you're in New York City! The bathroom is sparkly spotless| with lots of unexpected amenities beyond your little shampoos and soaps. I've never been to a…,
4,An excellent hotel,We stayed six nights in a classic suite. The room was large enough| clean and quiet. The hotel has good location| nice architecture and design. The main lobby is stylish. The staff are very friendly and polite. Breakfast| 24 h free coffee with bakery and fruit| and wine+cheese are a bonus. We are happy we chose Giraffe and would love to return. Without any doubt we can recommend this hotel. New York is a great city and staying in Giraffe makes the visit even better.,
2,Fantstic Hotel,The Service was excellent. The staff were very friendly and obliging. Enjoyed buffet breakfast and nightly wine & cheese. Atmospheric bar on roof (although sometimes unavailable if booked out).  Great location. Would happily stay again.,
3,Great Hotel,It's not the trendiest| or even the most lively hotel in Manhattan| but if you are looking for a great hotel with impeccable rooms| great service| a great location and at a really good price| then this is it. We've stayed at numerous hotels throughout the city over the years - the Waldorf Astoria| the Plaza| several W hotels and even the Marriott Marquis| but this one is right at the top of my list. There's no fancy restaurant or happening bar in the lobby so you'll have to leave to find your food and nightlife but that's exactly the way I want it. I've grown tired of pushing through a crowd of people hanging in the lobby for happy hour just to get to the elevator and most of the good restaurants aren't in the lobby of hotels anyway. The room was larger than many we've stayed in…,
14,everything we expected-excellent,we just completed a 4 night stay and would highly recommend this hotel. Wonderful service| amenities| spotless and tasteful. We enjoyed the evening wine and cheese while listening to Sinatra playing in the background. Great  safe location.  Awesome!!,
12,Wonderful,Great location friendly generous ! I called at the last minute and front desk gave me a great rate. When I arrived everyone was so friendly. My room was well appointed extremely comportable.  A nice surprise is there Italian reastaurant is wonderful and guest receive 20% off.  Breakfast and wine and cheese are complimentary chocolates and turn down.  Love this hotel.,
37,Wonderful,Stayed five nights here and really enjoyed it. As soon as we stepped out of the cab the attentive service started. I'm always hesitant that reviews will not live up to the truth| however they are pretty spot on. After touring the city and seeing the locations of other hotels that we had considered| we were very glad that we chose Hotel Giraffe.   I don't want to repeat what has already been said of the great amenities| location| and great hotel restaurant. I can't say enough about the service though| we were especially impressed with the doorman Jose| what a asset to the property.   Next time we come to NYC we are coming back here!,
54,Great location and great experience,Great location| employees are very nice| rooms are larger than we thought by NYC standards| definitely would consider staying here again.   Bathrooms had an unusual configuration but were good with water and so forth. We had a balcony room| which was nice but not large enough to sit on but good for letting in fresh air.  Free breakfast was nice| the laptop and printer in the lobby was handy and no complaints about the valet parking service (seems like they use another company).  Overall| a great experience and would stay here again.,
1,447,Great stay,Great hotel in good location| close to subway. As the hotel is not too big| service is more personal and friendly. Rooms are nice and modern and a good size for NYC. Rooms have free wi-fi| ipod docking station| iron| mini-bar. Our room even had a little balcony. There is a free breakfast buffet and wine and cheese every night. Check-out is at 1:00PM so no need to rush on your last day. I've stayed in many different hotels in NYC and this one will definitely become one of my favourites.
49,Perfect Hotel,Just returned from a 4-night stay with my husband and teen daughter.  The Hotel Giraffe was perfect.  We usually stay closer to Midtown so I was concerned about the location.  My concern was unwarranted.  The hotel was within walking distance to many eateries and shopping.  Taxis were readily available and the subway was just a couple of blocks away.  We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was a good size with plenty of closet space.  Very clean and tidy.  Good sized bathroom with nice amenities.  Complimentary water bottles and chocolates were provided every night with turn down service.  All of the staff were very friendly and some even remembered our name! The breakfast was excellent as was the wine and cheese in the evenings.  It was so nice to come into the lobby at any…,
77,Walking distance from everything you want,This is a lovely hotel. We had a small suite. Each evening they provide snacks and bubbly for guests. The location is fantastic within walking distance of 5th Avenue| Grand Central Station and the Empire State Building. It is also in a really nice area of New York. We will definitely go back,
12,fabulous hotel new york,My husband and I spent a long relaxing weekend in Hotel Giraffe! it was booked for a special birth day and was more than I  could have hoped for! after a shakey start(not hotels fault) the management and staff went out of their way to make us comfortable and feel very welcome! Kirsten and her team were fantastic the personal touch went a long way wine and chocolates were brought to our room as soon as Kirsten realised it was my birthday!Beautiful spacious clean room| luvly clean bathroom great shower lots of clean white towels and toilitries if needed bed turn down every nite with water and a choccie beside your bed!!!! Ample and fresh continental brekkie| tea and coffee available 24hrs|wine and cheese in the evening|buckets of ice brought to your room  and a great rooftop…,
31,Excellent Hotel,Just returned from a 5 night stay at the Giraffe. Could not find fault with anything at the hotel. All the staff were very friendly and nothing was too much for them to do. Our room was spotless| breakfast was excellent| tea and coffee and biscuits/cakes available at all times| free wine and cheese and nibbles at 5| 6 nights a week. Good position for getting out and about with metro nearby. Also some very good restaurants in the vicinity. Only downside| which goes for every hotel we have stayed in| in New York| and is not a criticism of the Giraffe is the car horn. Don't New Yorkers just love their horns!!!,
48,Great spot in NYC,Just returned from 5 day stay at Hotel Giraffe in NYC. Great location| handy to subway and since hotel  in midtown|  a relatively short distance to anything of interest. Our room was very clean and quiet | shower drained quickly| and the beds were fabulous. The breakfast in the lobby was more than adequate| and the coffee and cookies in the evening always welcome. The service was excellent--Jose| in particular was very helpful getting us started and pointed in right direction. I don't know when we will make it back to New York| but this is where we'd stay.,
61,Fantastic hotel,We stayed for 7 nights in September on the 6th floor.  We were opposite the office block that leaves their lights on all the time (!) and some of the light does seep in around the edges of the blackout blinds but it didn't bother us.  Some overnight road noise (car horns| refuse trucks) but not enough to keep us awake.  The hotel is very clean| the staff couldn't be more helpful and polite.  The room was spacious with good facilities.  The only thing I would have liked was in-room tea & coffee making facilities for that early morning cup of tea| but drinks are available 24 hours a day in the lobby.  The hotel provides a complimentary buffet breakfast and evening wine and nibbles in the lobby area - which is lovely.  The hotel is located 2 blocks from the subway| and within easy…,
205,Excellent Location and Clean Hotel,I can be very picky when it comes to hotels in NYC as I am a clean freak and also do not like tons of people in the lobby| etc. I like to stay in places that are quieter| yet not dead and boring. I succeeded in doing so with locating the Hotel Giraffe. The lobby is a great place to sit and do some work| enjoy a glass of wine while still in the heart of Manhattan. The staff was incredibly friendly and the room was very clean. The sheets were also very comfortable| which is also important to me. My room faced South Park Avenue and had a small balcony. It was an incredible value. I did hear some noise from the street| but nothing that disturbed me| and nothing that any other hotel (unless you go up to UES| etc) will not also experience.   Definitely try this hotel. As a big fan of…,
16,Excellent Hotel,I was very pleased with the hotel. The room was well proportioned for a hotel room in NYC and was very clean. The toiletries are nice and the bed is very comfortable. The hotel is not noisy. Plenty of nice touches| some really tasty chocolates from a local purveyor and a complimentary bottle of wine on arrival. Great breakfast in the morning| wine and snacks in the evening. A classic novel is included with the stay (we were asked which book we preferred| however| it did not eventuate. I think this was a mistake. Anyway| no big deal).  One suggestion: It would be great if staff could provide a list of recommended restaurants and cafes in the area (their own personal recommendations) as well as interesting things to see or do that are a bit off the beaten tourist track.,
72,Perfect stay again!,We just returned from our second stay at the Giraffe| the 1st several years ago.  It was again a perfect stay. We enjoyed 4 nights at the hotel.  Location was perfect for the subway and for walking around| room was spotless| and service was impeccable.  The front desk could not have been more helpful.   I have stayed at many hotels in NYC| and the rooms are more spacious than most and the balcony is an added feature that makes the Giraffe absolutely worth it.  We only had breakfast in the lobby once| it is a nice perk and the breakfast and all-day treats were very nice|  but it was quite crowded in the morning and hard to find a seat.  Overall this stay was wonderful and we look forward to returning soon.,
77,A perfect stay,We stayed in late September for 4 nights. The location was great- easy to get on the subway to any direction but out of the hoopla so you can relax a bit. The hotel was clean and nicely decorated| all very up to date. The service was friendly and efficient. The morning breakfast (complete with newspapers!) was a nice option to grab on the way to museums| etc and the happy hour wine| snacks were great as well as cookies| tea and coffee available at all times.. We enjoyed walking in the neighborhood south from the hotel also. We were on the 6th floor and there was some street noise but did not interrupt our sleep at all- white noise. There was no noise from within the hotel- nice sound proofing. I would definitely stay here again.,
91,Perfection,My sister & I stayed at the Giraffe for 7 nights late August this year and had a great time. The 2 queen bedded room was spacious| clean and well appointed and on the 11th floor (we had requested a high floor at the time of booking). We were undisturbed by any noise| inside the hotel or outside.  In all of my dealings with the staff via email as I sorted out the booking/availability etc I was struck by their cordiality and professionalism; this was borne out when we were in the hotel as well. Every staff member we met with was cheerful| warm and polite and the girls who served the breakfast and the evening drinks were very sweet. Although i had no particular requests| I got the impression that nothing would have been too much trouble.   I found the breakfast more than adequate…,
2,Perfect stay,We stayed at Hotel Giraffe. the Service was Perfect| the room very modern and clean. Our room was on Second floor| which was a Bit loud if you prefer to sleep with an Open window.  the breakfast was ok. We had fresh fruit| bagels and coffee which is ok to get started.  I found the Late Check Out Time at 1 pm Perfect.  Overall a very enjoyable stay.,
60,Great stay,We just returned from a 4 night stay at this property.  It might all our needs.  It was perfectly located.  It was spotlessly clean.  The staff were friendly.    I only had one negative comment:  not enough giraffes.    really this place was exactly as the other posters have noted.  No surprises.  It is a nice respite in the urban jungle.,
3,An excellent hotel,We stayed here on the last night of our trip to the USA having decided to treat ourselves. It was an excellent decision as the hotel was superb. At the time of booking we requested a high room and were given one on the 11th floor with a balcony. When we arrived we were stressed after having the airline lose one of our bags and the car we had booked to collect us at the airport not turn up. The staff were excellent and made us feel at home right away.   The rooms are a good size and very clean. The hotel is centrally located but you would not know that at night as it is very quiet. The breakfast is also very nice. There are also lots of extras such as a free book| free tea and coffee in the lobby all day and a free drinks reception every day.   We would recommend this hotel to…,
17,Great hotel that offerred everything we needed,I have a very active 2-year old and so I am very selective with hotels. I was a little concerned that the breakfast buffet offerred by the hotel would be too much for my daughter| but was very pleased to learn that trays were offerred downstairs so breakfast could be enjoyed in your room.  Another option we took advantage of was breakfast being delivered for just $5.00 per person.  I loved the small hotel feel and nothing seemed too much for any of the staff who were not only helpful| but very engaging.  The hotel arranged for babysitting services so we could dine at a couple of fantastic restaurants which were within walking distance (Gramercy Tavern and Eleven Madison Park).  I've stayed in NYC many times and I would have to say that this hotel was the most centrally-located. …,
249,Everything you would expect !,I stayed in New York City with my family at the Hotel Giraffe. Excellent location| clean and well maintained rooms| and a really complete (and tasty)  continental breakfast served daily in the hotel lobby. The staff went out of their way to make our stay pleasant and comfortable. They are geared towards 100% customer satisfaction. The hotel management really cares about your comfort and gives you personalized service. They have a very extensive wine list. My wife and I were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and could not have chosen a better hotel to stay in. I highly recommend this for anyone visiting New York City and wouldn't hesitate to reserve a room the next time we visit The Big Apple !,
104,Oh joy.,Located in a wonderful part of town| with parks to laze in and people to watch| I have just spent six idyllic days at the Giraffe and would go back at the drop of a hat. The staff are courteous| friendly and helpful| the rooms just fine| the facilities excellent and the afternoon wine and cheese much appreciated after a hard day's shopping. We ate like lords each night at splendid restaurants within a five minute walk and afterwards drank more wine with the giraffe on the roof. The Hotel Giraffe is a real treat and a tonic. Go there!,
16,New York City get away,Had a wonderful 3 night stay in New York City with my wife and daughter at the Hotel Giraffe. Excellent location| clean and well maintained rooms| and a terrific continental breakfast served daily in the lobby. The staff went out of their way to make our stay pleasant and comfortable. The hotel management even left a complimentary bottle of wine in our room after learning my wife and I were celebrating our 27th wedding anniversary. We highly recommend this hotel for couples and families and won't hesitate to book a room the next time we visit New York.,
7,Dont Let the Name Fool You,This hotel was full of unexpected suprises. From the rooms to the breakfast it was a win win situation.. Great value and top location. I would reccomend this hotel to any traveller. Thanks for the great service,
13,Noisy,Stayed at the 10th floor with a view on the street (but not Park Avenue). If you switch off the AC and fan| you hear the street noise really loud. Not a surprise because the double glazing was in bad condition. Might need replacement| affordable for the hotel if you think about the rates of the rooms... I called the reception and I was told that it was due to garbage collecting and that would stop 15 minutes later| but it did not stop.  Breakfast was good (real juices and good pastries)| no problem with the service but I did not really ask for anything. The rooftop is nice for smokers I guess| as the view is nothing special (only buildings on the other side of the street).  Complimentary wine in the room was awful.  Small rooms but I guess that is New York standards| I dont have…,
21,Great short break in New York,Great hotel| really friendly helpful staff (reception| breakfast| evening drinks and rooms)| beautiful rooms (great attention to detail) and everything (quality| cleanliness| contents) to a very high standard. The evening drinks and canapés are a great idea. The hotel is in an excellent location| 2 blocks from subway| 15 min walk to Empire State Building| 10 min walk to Flatiron Building (stop on Grayline Downtown tour) with numerous good local restaurants. It really deserves the 5 stars and if we return to New York this is where we will be staying.,
1,Not Giraffe Theme| but great none the less,This hotel was great as far as service and cleanliness. Staff attention was awesome. The only reason why I don't give it 5 starts is because I thought because of its name there would be Giraffes all over the place| being that our 4 year old loves Giraffes.  That was the main reason why we got this hotels beside all the other good reviews| I guess I expected Giraffe theme hotel but it wasn't (Giraffe is just the owner's favorite animal) and there are a few Giraffe things around but nowhere near close to what I expected| other than that great place to stay.,
15,Another great stay!,This is the second time my wife and I have stayed at the Giraffe and it was another excellent experience. The staff are always friendly especially the great girls serving the early evening drinks and snacks. This is not to be missed as free drinks and food has got to be great for everyone| especially in NYC.,
20,Couldn't have asked for more!,If this hotel looks like it ticks the boxes with what you are looking for| I guarantee you'll be even happier once you get there! The rooms (clean| quiet| lovely bathroom and comfy beds!)| the rooftop bar/restaurant| the breakfast| the free wifi| the cheese and wine every evening and the snacks in the lobby at all other times....all great. If that is not enough there is the fabulous location...very close to the nearest subway| but walking distance to several other lines as well...and the welcoming staff. Couldn't recommend more.,
10,Only place to stay in NYC,Great Hotel! Beautiful Rooms. Great location. Excellent Service. Management really goes the extra mile to make sure your stay is as good as it can be. So nice to come back and relax in the lobby with the daily wine and cheese after exploring the city. Highly recommended!,
18,As Good As It Gets,My wife and stay at the Giraffe every summer. I don't think you will find a better value in NYC. Confortable rooms| a robust continental breakfast| complementary wine and crudite served in the early evening| daily newspapers| wifi| access to a near by health club| GREAT location for accessing the city| the list goes on. But if I had to point to the one thing that keeps us coming back it is the dedicated and personized service offered by every single person who works there.,
892,Like the small lobby,Look let’s face it New York is expensive for eating| drinking| shopping| and sleeping but the rooms are always too small but get over it.  The lobby is hands down the best thing about this hotel and the service you get in the lobby. There is always a NYT| WSJ| or a USA today to read and take with you. Cookies| coffee| tea| and water 24/7. the wine and cheese is a nice touch| but do not expect a $100 bottle of wine. I saw a review complaining about the wine| but what we had was fine. It was nice to come in after a long day and sit down with a glass of water or wine and some cheese and olives. The breakfast was fine unless you want ham and eggs. Subway line 6 (green) is about two blocks away. You can also walk down to catch bus 23 and transfer for and catch the other subway lines.…,
60,As good as you can find in New York,This would maybe be 5 blobs by New York standards. But| as we all know| New York hotels are silly prices| (especially after the state and city rip you off with ridiculous taxes for spending your money in their city) and seriously under-deliver by world standards. Location is great| it is chic| free internet and continental breakfast| (though go up the road to Les Halles for decent coffee and proper breakfast) rooms are nice| though small. But the idea that you can spend $500  a night to stand in a tiny bath behind a plastic curtain to shower is a stark reminder of how low New York standards are. It is my regular NY stop| but would switch in an instant if I could find a solution closer to other capital city standards.,
40,Clean| friendly| relaxing,My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights while I was on business. All of the staff were friendly and accommodating. We got in around 11:00am and stored our bags since the room wasn't ready. We got back around 2:00| and even though we still had to wait until after 3:00 for our room the staff knew we were in the lobby and brought our key over to us| rather than us having to keep checking on the status. Rooms are clean and nicely decorated. The window has an electric shade but it wasn't wide enough to completely black out the room. Each floor has only 7 rooms| so you don't have large hallways with lots of noise. There are always snacks and coffee available in the bright| spacious lobby| and the free continental breakfast every morning was a nice perk. The location was close to my…,
1,Hotel Giraffe review,Excellent hotel fantastic location- buffet  breakfeast/evening wine and cheese nice touch  and saves money would use again need I say more,
16,You have to compromise!,If you're willing to:  Sacrifice unaffordable hotel prices and settle for NYC style| reasonable.   Sacrifice glitzy ambience and settle for hip-understated.   Sacrifice hotel staff indifference and settle for service with a smile.   Sacrifice a hotel of strangers and adopt one as your extended family.  If your willing to make all of these sacrifices| then stay at the Hotel Giraffe.  We did| and  we will in the future.,
25,Beautiful hotel| great location!,This hotel is amazing! The location is perfect because you are right by 23rd Street which has every single subway you could possibly need| and if you do not want to walk across town to pick up one of the west side subways you also have the 23rd street cross town bus| which will take you all the way across town in any direction| however Park avenue is pretty central once you get downtown so walking across town is not to bad.  As for the hotel| the rooms are relatively big for a NYC hotel room| they are decorated very nicely| simple and clean design| great to come back to after a long day in NYC. The hotel also offers evening hor d'oeuvres and breakfast in the lobby. A perfect presentation and more food than expected. The evening hor d'oeuvres also included a live pianist playing…,
12,Great hotel| great location| really helpful staff,One of the main reasons for choosing the Giraffe was its location| coupled with the fact the hotel is always in the Top Ten for NYC on Trip Advisor.  	My trip to NY was a family holiday| primarily for my daughter’s 21st birthday| and we wanted to stay somewhere special| but not overly pretentious or decked with staff wanting a tip for every door that was held open. 	As I hoped| the Giraffe did not disappoint my expectations. In fact it was a wonderful stay. Well placed on Park Avenue South| two blocks from subway line 6 and with an abundance of cabs passing| it proved the perfect bolt hole. 	Our room had twin double beds| was very well appointed with an iPhone dock system| a spaceous bathroom and a view over the E26/Park Ave Sth junction which was great. Fresh bottled water was…,
13,Our 1st stay at the Giraffe - was excellent,We typically spend a long weekend in NYC every year.  Have stayed in many hotels - including the Giraffe's sister hotel The Library 7-8 times.  This year we decided to stay at the Giraffe - and I am so glad we did!  We booked a queen room with a balcony - the red French doors and curtains are very cool.  The room was a nice size - bigger than many NYC hotel rooms.  We used the passes to the NY Sports Club every day (we had to get our work outs in to balance with eating all of the great food in the city!).  The NYSC is only 3 short blocks away.  We had breakfast - lots to choose from and wine and cheese one evening.  It was also nice to have cold water with lemons and cookies waiting when we arrived back at the hotel late in the evening.  The hotel was very clean and the staff…,
30,Hotel Giraffe| head and shoulders above the rest.,My sister and I and two friends have just had the most enjoyable stay at the Giraffe.  Lots of positive things have already been said about the hotel which we entirely agree with however what makes this hotel special is the staff and  how they want you to treat the hotel as your home for the duration of your stay.  For example| on our last day we had checked out but because our flight was early evening| we left our bags at the hotel and went out. We had had lovely weather however the heavens opened and we all got drenched.  We arrived back at the hotel looking very sorry sights. Jose the doorman was fantastic. He got our bags| got us a room where we got dried and changed and he even provided carrier bags for us to put our soggy clothes in. This was typical of the service we got|…,
1,"The Giraffe is our ""go to"" place in New York",The service and ammenities excellent.  My wife loves the views from the balcony.  Restaurants| shops and the train station are within walking distance.  And the subway is just a few blocks away.  What's not to like?,
27,"what are your ""reviewers"" smoking?","Base on the ""reviews"" on this website we booked our vacation here: (not our first time in New York and won't be the last ... we love NY!!) We recently stayed 6 nights at this establishment ($3200 which is fine) ...this review is for seasoned travellers ... this hotel is ""OK""| and ONLY ""OK""| by any standard by which you which to measure it... small rooms (we had a ""suite"" (very small) with inside wall views of the local office with windows 30 feet from us that peered into our room) ... a small bathroom...no ice on any floor...no sundrys| pop etc anywhere (""you can go the grocery store"" we were told and that is not first class ... that's just NO CLASS!) ... the rooftop area which seems to be a hightlight for some reviewers is very small with tired furniture and no ""view"" of…",
5,A New Favorite in NYC,We just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Giraffe.  The only complaint that I would have is that our stay was too short!  This boutique hotel has large| well appointed rooms with all the ammenities of a more expensive hotel.  We found it to be an excellent value as there is an open coffee/refreshment bar 24 hours a day| an lovely continental breakfast each morning and a wine and cheese reception each evening from 5-8.  The service at the hotel was outstanding in all areas.  Our room was very clean and much larger than other hotels that I have stayed at in NYC. My husband and I were visiting New York to help our son get settled at NYU.  As his dorm is near Union Square| we found the location to be very convenient.  There are also many great dining options within walking…,
188,As close to a B&B as you'll get in New York City,New York City does not have a lot of B&B's. If that is the kind of place you like| Hotel Giraffe is a good alternative. It is a real hotel with a doorman and 24-hour desk| but it is quite small and features a lovely buffet breakfast in the lobby every day (included in the price). The breakfast includes various kinds of breads and bagels (it's New York| after all)| fruit| yogurt| and other items| but no warm entrees. In the late afternoon there is a wine and cheese party (free) every day| with piano music.  The rooms and bed are comfortable and there are many restaurants nearby. The subway is about a 3-minute walk from the hotel. The staff is friendly and helpful. Definitely a step up from the big chain hotels.,
17,Fantastic roof top!,First time to NYC and this hotel is perfectly located to walk everywhere/catch the subway. The staff are attentive and so friendly. The rooftop area is fantastic to relax after taking in the sights and sounds of manhattan| and complimentary wine and cheese is a nice touch between 5-8pm each evening. My suite was adequate with everything I needed. Bed comfortable and turn down service with music and chocolates were a really nice touch. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would return...happy memories of my 7 day vacation!,
1,Close to Flawless,I'm always staying in Hotel Giraffe when on business in NYC for a lot of reasons. Apart from the location equidistant to Central Park and Down town| there is a certain atmosphere I find in no other hotel: Everybody seems to be committed to create a great service above and beyond there actual assignment. Everybody greets you with a smile no matter who. Everybody makes that extra effort: e.g. during the daily cheese and wine service in the lobby from 5-8| I felt for strawberries going along with the prosecco. I asked if I can 'destroy' the decoration of the cheese platter| which had some strawberries. Of course I could! ... but why can the hostess not bring me just a small bowl? And in no time she brought me a portion of strawberries. It's those little things which makes it…,
143,Excellent boutique hotel,First of all| I will try not to compare this to the top luxury hotels in NYC.  As far as the boutique hotels| I give it a 4 1/2. Front desk| doorman| and breakfast staff are all excellent and helpful. My room (a corner suite) was very large and nicely furnished. It appeared first rate in every way except I give the bed a 3/5. The bathroom was large enough and well illuminated. It was quiet even though it is right on Park Avenue.  The rooms could be darkened completely to block out the early morning sun. The complementary breakfast was very adequate with super coffee available all day.  The afternoon wine and cheese looked good but I never had to chance to sample it.  The rooftop bar is very nice however service can be a little slow and many tables were reserved hours in advance.…,
2,Fantastic hotel,We stayed here from 9th to 12th August.  The hotel is in an excellent location.  Our room was well appointed with high spec.and very spacious| especially for New York.  All the staff could not have been more helpful.  The breakfast was very fresh and excellent selection and the cheese and wine reception was the perfect way to end the afternoon or to start your evening.  Have already recommended to friends and family and will stay again next time we are in New York.,
2,Great Little Hotel,We were in NYC for a wedding and could not be happier with this hotel. Good service| location| and friendly staff made it a big hit. Coffee and sweets are available all day long. The wine and cheese hour is quite a nice spread.  Make sure to try out the rooftop area for cocktails. We really enjoyed our stay.  It was a pleasant experience.,
8,A superb boutique hotel in NYC,We have just returned today from a 4 night break at Hotel Giraffe and I have to say that look as hard as I did| I could not find fault! We had a deluxe king room which was spacious and had a Juliet balcony overlooking Park Avenue South.  The room itself was spotless and was restocked with complimentary bottled water each day. The buffet breakfast is excellent - such a variety of choice and it's included in the price of the room which| when coupled with the evening wine (Prosecco included!) and cheese reception| adds up to a considerable saving. The hotel employees were friendly and most helpful and all I can say is that we will definitely stay here again!,
1,everything you need!,small boutique hotel with extras.  5pm wine and cheese| ample continental breakfast and great staff. Good location and most important to my husband and myself very very clean and comfortable.  We enjoyed the smaller atmosphere while in the lobby and piano area with friends.  Will be our choice in the future.,
1,Very pleasant and professional,Enjoy your stay at this modern small boutique hotel.  The staff is helpful and friendly and the service excellent.  The continental breakfast (which is included in the price) is plentiful and the food is fresh.  Wine and cheese are served every day except Sunday from 5 pm until 7 pm.  As a frequent traveler to NY| I find this little gem to be an oasis in the city.,
1,Beautiful!,This hotel was beautiful and so accommodating. The room was spacious and clean. The staff was wonderful and very friendly. The extras were great... The wine reception| the 24hr coffee station and the breakfast. We will DEFINITELY return on our next trip tp NYC.,
483,Nice| comfortable stay.,Overall a very nice experience staying there.  The location is excellent for our purposes| the people are very friendly.  The availability of drink and small snacks 24 hours a day is a god send.  We stayed there with our family of 7 ( from 18 years old to 4 years old daughter).,
483,Nice| comfortable stay.,Overall a very nice experience staying there.  The location is excellent for our purposes| the people are very friendly.  The availability of drink and small snacks 24 hours a day is a god send.  We stayed there with our family of 7 ( from 18 years old to 4 years old daughter).,
28,Great hotel!,We were at the hotel for a family wedding.  The staff was very eager to help with all of our requests.  We had a suite without a pull out bed in the sitting area (which our adult son said was 'comfortable for a sleeper sofa'). This is a great hotel in a vibrant area.  The staff was nice and always helpful.  It was great to feel like you are receiving value and understated elegance when staying in NYC.  Can't wait to go back.,
1,very satisfied,Actually the hotel deserves 4.5 stars. It is neat and cosy| not posh| but very good quality. Double rooms are pretty standard size| but have everything you might need| including an iron and ironing board and a small balcony. The location is amazing: the neighborhood is clean and has plenty of good restaurants and a couple of night clubs| it's a walking distance to the Empire State building| Union Square and East/West Village (If you prefer to be right next to Time Square dazzling lights| need to live amidst  a sea of people and multitude of Irish pubs| that would probably NOT be your best choice). Breakfast is decent and included in the rate| which is quite rare. Also| the rate includes wine and cheese and coffee and snacks served daily at the lobby. The staff is friendly and…,
2,Chris D,Stayed for 5 nights with the family. Good location. Service superb Would definatley recommend this hotel to friends and family. Breakfast was good and the free cheese and wine after a long days sightseeing was a pleasant suprise and real bonus. Staff friendly and highly efficient,
2,location| breakfast and wine!,we had a lovely stay| 3 nights| and found fault with almost nothing. the only issue| honestly| was that there are no exhaust fans in the bathroom. the savings on the breakfast alone are significant -- it's no secret that eating out in NYC is expensive| so having a delicious| albeit simple| breakfast for free in the comfort of the hotel lobby was a huge plus (more money for shoes!).,
5,4 nights in New York,We stayed 4 nights in New York part business part leisure. We chose the Giraffe hotel partly through the reviews on this website but also because of the neat and and effcient way that the handled our enquiry.  On arrival the front desk were very helpful| the rooms were exactly as described (not over embelished as is often the case).  The room (807) was very comfortable and had all the amenities we required complete with small balcony.  The roof top terrace was a good place to sit and relax.  The breakfast  which so often is extra in these hotels was excellent and served by such helpful and friendly staff. The location is good too.  When we return to the city as I am sure we will the Giraffe would be our first port of call in search of accommodation.,
1,Anniversary Gem,The staff at Hotel Giraffe were fantastic.  I mentioned when booking that it was my 50th Birthday and our 20th anniversary.  When we arrived we found a complimentary bottle of wine in our room and our room had been upgraded to a King Suite on a high floor.   The rooftop lounge was a  plus at the end of our evening.  The hotel has offers a complimentary wine & cheese reception in the lobby if you arrive between 5-8pm and a complimentary continental breakfast in the morning.  The staff were pleasant| accommodating| and everything you want in a hotel staff.  There is no pool or gym but everything else makes up for it.  I highly recommend.,
60,Second stay was also great!,My husband and I just spent a three night weekend at the Giraffe - my second experience at the hotel.  The first time I was there I was with my 13 year old daughter and we had one of the suites.  It was very comfortable and having the breakfast made it that much easier in the mornings.  This time| it was just my husband and I and we have been to NYC so many times so I was really hoping he would like the hotel.  We had a regular room on the second floor - Room 202 to be exact - kinda low so I was concerned but it had a terrific little balcony with beautiful plants and flowers on it.  We sat out there every evening for a quick cocktail and to relax after the day's walking.  We could not have been happier at the hotel - a friend met us on the roof for cocktails one night and it was…,
30,Cosy hotel with roof terasse,Cosy hotel with good atmosphere. Nice feature with an open bar in the afternoon with drinks and snacks. Cosy but basic breakfast| however in pleasent surroundings with sofas| lounge etc. Nice rooms in very good new shape with french doors. Good roof terrace. Good advice| go for a room on high floor...,
62,Great Hotel,Hotel Giraffe was great. I mentioned when booking that my husband and I were looking forward to spending our wedding anniversary in NY and on arrival the hotel had supplied a card and a complimentary bottle of wine in our room.  There is a turn down service and they leave chocs by the bed which my 11 year old was very impressed with.  The breakfast offers a nice range of produce and the cheese and wine in the evening was also lovely. We had a room with a small balcony which offered a good view of the chaos below.  The hotel is fairly central and within close walking distance of the Flat Iron Building and Empire State Building. There is also a subway station across the road.  The street behind the hotel has lots of restaurants.  My only concern was the roof top terrace which I…,
20,Quiet| smaller| modern hotel with great service and extras,Stayed here one night (Friday) in a king suite room that was very comfortable| clean| and relaxing.  I had stayed at the Hotel Elysee| this hotel's sister property on 54th| for the previous 3 nights| and I have to say I preferred this hotel in every category except location.  I loved the more modern furnishings| sleek decorating| and soothing atmosphere here.  The king suite had a queen sized pull-out couch that was very comfortable for my daughters.  We had a better view from the 4th floor of 26th St. and Park Ave. than we had at Hotel Elysee on the 8th floor| where our view was of a concrete wall.  The rooftop bar was probably my favorite thing about the Giraffe| with wonderful views and fresh air (well| as fresh as you can get in NYC).  My daughters were warmly welcomed and…,
781,well run boutique hotel in mid town,I found the Hotel Giraffe a satisfying experience not least the well appointed and spacious rooms. The Hotel provides free wifi throughout| and has a cosy informal lobby which also serves as a club like lounge for the guests where breakfast is served; and also drinks and cocktails in the afternoon. Service is efficient in an unobtrusive way.This hotel is conducive for longer stays as it has the feel of service apartments| and located in a centrally located yet relatively quiet  neighborhood with a residential feel. Room decor is elegant in an understated way(perhaps a touch somber with hues of gray dominating)Their king suites are well configured| but if possible| ask for rooms ending with 06| which faces Park Ave and has better natural light. There are some nice touches as…,
4,An oasis in New York city!,After hours of research I picked Hotel Giraffe for our family trip to NY city. It was my daughter's 16th birthday and I wanted everything to be perfect. We stayed the first few days in Times Square and then moved to the Giraffe for the last two nights. The location was ideal and very close to two subway stations. This hotel was a welcome retreat from the craziness of Times Square. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Because it was part of the library collection of hotels the teens were provided with a classic hard covered book of their choosing. There were also books provided in the room. We loved the darkening screen that covered the window for sleeping that was activated by a switch (just like the movies!) The robes ans slippers provided were a nice treat. I especially…,
1,Quick Weekend Away,We just spent a wonderful weekend away in New York City.  I wanted to try a hotel that did not have the typical name brand attached to it.  I was pleasantly surprised that the Hotel Giraffe was the best hotel that we have ever stayed in.  We stayed in the king with sitting area| which our teenage son found very comfortable. The Hotel is extremely clean| the staff is very polite and helpful.  The added bonus is the hospitality of little extras in the morning and throughout the day.  Both outside patio and lobby are very comfortable to relax while waiting for family members to gather.   We highly recommend Hotel Giraffe. The Daniw Family,
15,Wonderful Experience!,I stayed at Hotel Giraffe for a weekend with 3 friends and had a wonderful experience!  Kirsten and the entire hotel staff were lovely and so accomodating.  I asked to get into the room early to decorate for my friend's birthday and they let me in no problem| and provided some tape to hang a 'Happy Birthday' banner.  The rooms were good size and clean with quality bedding.  The lobby is very inviting with tables and couches to enjoy the complimentary coffee| wine and apps!  We had a drink one night at the bar on the rooftop terrace which was so nice.  The rates are very affordable considering you get breakfast| wine| apps and clean and comfortable accomodations.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to everyone I know.  Thanks for a great weeend!,
7,An Oasis In The City,This is the second time that I have visited this hotel and it certainly wont be the last!  This time I came to the city to have a reunion with my cousin whom I hadn't seen in a long time. Upon arriving| in my room there was a bottle of wine to celebrate this event. This establistment is all about SERVICE and it is always done with a smile or a kind gesture.  I love this place for its coziness and efficiency.  Again thank you Jose for everything you do for this hotel and the patrons.,
83,Great Hotel in Midtown,Wonderful hotel.  Exceptionally clean.  Breakfast included (continental).  Around 5PM| complimentary wine and cheese.  Loved that after walking up and down Manhattan all day.  Great restaurants very close (head to the Flatiron building -- wonderful restaurants all around).  For more reasonably priced restaurants (but good) head to Lexington two blocks away. Everyone at the hotel was great and offered helpful tips.  Subway (#6) downtown right across from the hotel and the uptown (#6) only a block or so away.  Tried out the restaurant in the basement of the hotel -- very happy with our meal.  Good for your first night after your plane flight.  Would strongly recommend this hotel and its' location.,
1,Pretty close to perfect,Everyone was friendly| accommodating| and helpful.  The room was the perfect size| very clean| and the balcony was an extra special treat.  Everything at the complimentary breakfast was fresh and the attendant was eager to serve.  The location was within walking distance of everything we needed -- especially shopping and excellent dining.  The valet parking was essential for us.  The rooftop bar makes a fantastic cucumber martini and was the perfect spot for relaxing after a hectic day.  Hotel Giraffe was a wonderful experience!,
15,location| location| location.....,This was our first trip to NYC and we are so glad we chose the Hotel Giraffe.  We arrived by car for a 4 night stay| and the whole process couldn't have went smoother.  The valet whisked away our car| and the desk staff was able to provide us with our room before check-in time.  Our room was fantastic.  We were on the 8th floor with a balcony right on Park Ave.  It was clean and nicely decorated with a large bathroom.  There were always plenty of towels| and even robes with slippers provided.  A turn-down service is provided| where they replace your bottled water as well as turn on some nice music.  Tasty chocolates were also provided at this time.  The window has a great shade that darkens the room nicely-it is operated by a switch on the wall.  The hotel breakfast is very good…,
37,From Check-in to Check-out - Completely Enjoyable!,When staying in NYC| I have come to expect some glitches with hotel stays. Even the top rated hotels usually have something that you have to overlook but not the Hotel Giraffe. My teenage daughter and I stayed here during a long weekend in July.  We had a one bedroom suite.  The room was nice and spacious and the bed very comfortable.  We LOVED the location - it was so easy to get everywhere we wanted and there were lots of great places to get a bite to eat. We stayed on the fifth floor and I was a little concerned that it might be noisy but it was fine.   The services at the hotel were superb especially the complimentary breakfast and afternoon wine and cheese. The lobby was relaxing and the service although a little absent was friendly and warm.    The Hotel Giraffe does not…,
315,Well presented & comfortable hotel in a quiet location (for NY!),Stayed here for 3 nights with my family in July while in NY.  Ticked all the boxes for me; smart| clean| good service and in a quiet location.  Just over one block to the MTA so very easy to go down or uptown.  Rooftop bar and Italian restaurant also good but not cheap| but what do you expect.  Would certainly recommend and likely to use again if we visit again.,
1,Pleasant stay,This hotel is really great. I didn't really know what to expect first. The hotel room was big and spacious| nice clean double bed. Everything was clean andr felt fresh. The breakfast was nice and most of all: the vine/cheese buffet was great. The hotel is really nice located| close to almost all you would like to see.  Would I book this hotel again? Yes!  /Dennis,
1,My wedding was perfect because of Hotel Giraffe!,I had my wedding and cocktail hour at the Hotel Giraffe in late June and I can't say enough amazing things about my experience.  From the moment we arrived| we were greeted with a smile by Jose who helped us with all of our bags and took care of parking the car (huge plus).  The rooms were spacious| beautiful and had a great views of the city.  The staff were always polite| professional and eager to make our stay memorable.  Prioir to the wedding| our coordinator| Emily White was super organized and helped prioritize what needed to be done leading up to the big day.  Our experience wouldn't have been the same without Emily| she was on top of every detail and her calm| cool nature helped me immensely before walking down the aisle!  I received so many compliments from our guests…,
282,Uptown gem,Very well situated hotel on 6th Avenue. Subway is only 2 blocks away. Rooms are quite spacious (NYC standards). Breakfast is rather limited and is served in the lobby. Unfortunately there is often not that much room for everyone| so in case you arrive late you'll have to wait to be seated. There is a rooftop bar but it's only now and then open...  Staff is quite friendly & helpfull.,
2,Best hotel experience ever!,Just returned from staying at the Hotel Giraffe and already miss being there!  They provide excellent service in every area:  friendly & helpful staff; delicious complimentary breakfast; wine & cheese in the afternoon and every amenity you could desire.  The rooms were clean| quiet & well appointed and the bathroom was large. Our hotel experience made our trip to NYC so enjoyable.  I can't wait to go back just to stay at the Hotel Giraffe.,
13,Best hotel we have stayed in Manhattan,We stayed for three days and had a spacious suite - a real one with a cozy sitting room and a really separated bedroom. Pleasant decor| functional furniture and interior. Great lobby with a complimentary snack on the counter at all times. Free breakfast and free fast wifi. Very friendly and helpful staff without the overcool attitude found in some other boutique hotels... Best value for money we have so far found in Manhattan - after trying numerous hotels. Our search has ended...,
3,A great place to stay in Manhattan,"The hotel staff were friendly| courteous and extremely professional without being officious.  Their general attitude was ""if you need it| we will provide it"".  The room was immaculate| comfortable and virtually soundproof.  The midtown location is very convenient and the hotel was a good value for a property in Manhattan.  I'd recommend the Hotel Giraffe without hesitation and would stay there again.  If I were to be extremely picky I'd say the aroma therapy bath products were fairly generic and the continental breakfast was very good but not exceptional| but these are minor quibbles.",
4,5 recent nights in NYC,We recently stayed at the Hotel Giraffe after a recommendation from a friend.  Our five nights were one of the best experiences we have had in a NYC hotel.  Our suite was comfortable and very quiet.  The morning buffet was totally satisfying.  We didn't take advantage of the cheese and wine late afternoon| but it looked terrific! The front desk helped us with securing very hard to get tickets to a Broadway show as well as access to nearby popular restaurants.,
1,Great Hotel,This hotel is very very nice.  I had a wonderful room and the staff were very nice.  Easy access to subway to mid-town for shopping.  The breakfast was very good too.  I would stay at this hotel again and highly recommend it to others.,
4,Look No Further...Best hotel in NY.,This very cool hotel has it ALL.   The nicest hotel staff you will ever meet.  Incredibly helpful| sweet| and SO professional. The best breakfast- full meal included with your room .  Excellent coffee. Fresh seasonal fruit. The cleanest rooms- Beautiful and super comfy bed. The best location for seeing the city... able to walk to all the greatest hits. The afternoon wine bar and appetizers...ALSO included with your room.....!  Hands down| the Hotel is the greatest!  Will to be back soon!,
8,Birthday Weekend in The City,I took my girlfriend for a weekend in the city for her birthday. Upon entering the hotel| they were able to hold our bags for the day| so we could go out and adventure. When we returned and checked-in| we went up to our room. We entered our room and it was gorgeous. A bottle of wine was waiting for us in our suite that we had been upgraded to. Having a balcony in the room was probably her favorite part of the trip. Ha. The staff was courteous and helpful. The wine hours were wonderful. The amenities were fantastic. They really went out of their way to make sure that we were satisfied.It was a wonderful stay. We look forward to our trip back!,
68,Wonderful hotel with lots of extra touches,We loved this great boutique hotel. It’s location is perfect for going out and exploring| away from the most noisy and crowded streets| but still very central. Our room was large and spacious and very clean. The continental breakfast included tasty NY bagels with peanut butter or cream cheese – yum! It was hard not to overdo it each morning! We only managed to get to the complimentary cheese & wine one evening| but when we did we somewhat overindulged and very much enjoyed it! The rooftop bar is a great place to chill out| enjoy a cocktail and just take in the city – we absolutely loved retiring there after a hard day’s sight seeing. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone visiting NYC.,
35,Great Boutique Hotel!,This is our favorite NYC hotel. Discovered it a few years ago and have never gone anywhere else since. They hotel is small and only has a few rooms per floor. The rooms are clean and very nice. The hotel has complimentary breakfast in the morning and wine and cheese in the afternoons. It has a great location close to subway lines and a short walk to washington square park. The staff is excellent!,
1,Perfect!!,Spent a long weekend here to visit museums and do some work. This was my first time staying in NYC| and Hotel Giraffe was absolutely perfect in terms of location and service! Jonathan was so accommodating in handling my reservation and the doormen and front-desk staff were always pleasant. The room was immaculate and the breakfasts were such a convenient way to start the day...took coffee to the rooftop in the mornings and sat peacefully in the lounge with espresso at night to do work. Just 2 blocks from line 6 metro station| and a quick walk to Eataly. Loved Hotel Giraffe and definitely recommend to others!!,
4,Lovely stay,We had a great stay at the Giraffe. Attentive and knowledgeable staff| great location| and coffee and cocktails were appreciated. We stayed in room 1203-best room and view in town. Thanks to the Giraffe-we will be back.,
7,Just Perfect,My mom and I stayed at the Giraffe for a quick trip to NYC recently. We both loved everything about the hotel:  the size| cleanliness and comfort of the room (we had a 1-BR suite); the front-desk staff; and the extras like the breakfast & afternoon happy hour with good wine and cheese.  All this was perfect anyway| but on top of it all| my mom sprained her ankle during the trip| and the staff was SO helpful in taking care of her needs after that; every time we requested ice (which was frequent!)| someone was at the door within a few minutes with a bag full and a kind word.  Another staff member (sweet guy whose name I've forgotten--so sorry!) spent awhile on the phone helping me track down a drugstore that sold canes.  Everyone (includ. the manager| Kirsten) was just…,
16,We'll be back!,Upscale and modern...good location. Very courteous and helpful staff. We loved the complimentary wine and cheese reception| as well as the Continental breakfast. Both are quite a value add to the hotel experience. Rooms are a good size and well-appointed. We will definitely be back!,
8,Super place !,My mother and I stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for the first time in June. In our opinion| we thought the hotel was GREAT.  The location was convenient.  It was quite warm when we visited the city so there was always iced water w/ lemons ready for us to drink in the lobby. This was quite nice! Also| there is complimentary breakfast which we thoroughly appreciated.  There was turn down service at night and small chocolates were left which were a delight to us.    I recommend this hotel and certainly will return to this hotel when it comes time to visit my relatives again.,
2,A nice get away| right in the middle of it all,Awesomely friendly people| great lobby with complimentary wine| cheese| breakfast| coffee| tea| and jazz in the early evenings| quality rooms with great touches and super comfy beds| nice rooftop lounge. Plus passes to a gym nearby. It's a place I will go back to.,
5,Loved the Hotel Giraffe,"When I lived in the NY area| I used to drive by the Hotel Giraffe all the time and said to myself| ""that looks like an interesting place""| so on a recent trip back to the City| I decided to give it a try.  I am so happy that I did.  From the moment I checked in| I realized that I had found a gem.  Small| personal| with great touches.  The desk staff were fast and knowledgeable.  I was so happy with my room -- when I saw the little balcony -- I thought| what a luxury.  Besides all that| it was so clean| had a small refrigerator| and offered complimentary water.  I ordered room service one night and it was both fast and delicious.  I slept more soundly than many nights at home.  I didn't really want to check out.  But| I can't wait to go back.",
87,We'll be back,We've stayed at many NYC hotels| but this is our favorite. Convenient location| comfortable rooms| cheerful and courteous staff| wonderful complimentary breakfast and other small snacks throughout the day| free wifi| great rooftop bar| and an overall relaxing vibe throughout the hotel. It was always a relief to walk into the lobby| grab a cookie and tea or ice water and collapse there at the end of a trek around the city. The rooms are large by NY standards| the thick robes and slippers added a nice touch| the push-button shade blocked the early light and helped muffle street noise. We spent two nights here and wished it could have been a week. Nicest staff too--they made every encounter pleasant. We will plan future trips around the Hotel Giraffe.,
41,Once again| an outstanding experience at Giraffe!,"Ever since we discovered Hotel Giraffe about 10 years ago| it remains our favorite place to stay when visiting N.Y. We were there for the 7th or 8th time now and still have a good feeling. Excellent location| large rooms compared to most other N.Y. hotels| impeccable service| friendly staff. No reason to change. All friends we convinced not to go for the so-called ""most popular hotels"" as offered in travel magazines| share our opinion and put Giraffe with their favorites. We will be back...",
3,Fantastic hotel,My wife and I had our wedding reception at the hotel| and stayed there either side of the wedding with our daughter and families. Emily White| the hotel Events Manager was enormously helpful throughout the entire process of planning the reception| and her and the hotel's other staff were extraordinarily kind and helpful during our stay. We would wholeheartly recommend Hotel Giraffe| whether simply as a place to stay| or as a venue for a family event. We are so grateful to the whole team for making our stay| and our special day| so memorable. We are very much looking forward to returning in the near future.,
123,Location| location| location,Nothing too much trouble| good restaurant| rooftop bar| cheese and wine friendly staff| turn down service| fantastic breakfast| subway 2 mins away| Macy's 15 mins| empire state mins away| park close by| lovely rooms ideal for families - only criticism was bathroom door (but a minor point). We will come back| thanks we had a great trip and enjoyed what the hotel had to offer it made for an excellent New York City vacation.,
115,Really nice property with GREAT service!,"I usually stay at the Gansevoort Park Hotel when going to NYC| but I decided to try the Giraffe since it's closer to my daughter's Gramercy Park apt. For the price of an average NY Hotel| I got a 1BR suite with a separate living room| restocked water twice/day and a welcome bottle of Merlot. They also are part of the ""library collection""| so I was given a complimentary hard back book of my choice. Combine that with a free continental breakfast| tea time/wine time and free internet| Hotel Giraffe is a bargain for NYC upper level hotels!",
189,Excellent,After much research on Tripadvisor we booked the Giraffe for our first trip to NY and my husband's 40 th birthday.  We were very pleased with our choice - the staff were lovely - the location excelent| far enough away from the hussle and bussle but close enough to a subway stop and with plenty of restaurants close by. Our King Deluxe room was great and we loved the cheese and wine evening which we joined each night as a wind down from the tiring day.   The complimentary breakfast probably saved us a fortune.  If we come back to NY we will definately try another hotel within this group.,
12,Cute place in quitet neighborhood,This was a fun little hotel. The rooms were nice and sunny| I hate dark hotel rooms and this was not. I sat out on the little balcony which was nice. The rooftop was a nice little escape and one afternoon when I wasn't working I had it to myself. The breakfast were simple and I wouldn't have needed more| the snacks and wine were a nice touch in the late afternoon. the Lobby is small and can get crowded but it's cute.,
21,Large| beautiful rooms,I stayed at Hotel Giraffe for just one night while on business| but it was the best night I've spent in New York City. I was lucky enough to get upgraded to a Classic King Suite| which offered a large separate sitting area| spacious bedroom (with a long desk--thank you!)| and the largest| most updated bathroom I've ever seen in a NY hotel room.  The room wasn't inexpensive| but it was comparable to what I've spent at the Grand Hyatt and Hilton New York. And those hotels do not come close to the amenities and quality offered at the Giraffe. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. The hotel offered an impressive spread at the wine and cheese reception. And I appreciated not being nickeled and dimed over WiFi| which worked great.  Noise will be more of an issue at this hotel|…,
64,Elegant| convenient and comes with breakfast!,We just loved our getaway to this European-like hotel.  The location was convenient and the ambience was relaxed but elegant.  Late afternoon beverages and snacks| including wine and accompanied by piano music| were a real treat as was the buffet breakfast in the lobby.  Our room was a bit small but just fine.  We would definitely go back.,
13,Wonderful stay in a great NYC hotel,We had the good fortune to stay in this wonderful hotel| in a great location for a whole ten days.  The staff were excellent| nothing was too much trouble| they even allowed us late check out at no extra charge.  Breakfast was great| the wine and cheese was wonderful after a hard day of sight-seeing.  I have already recommended the Giraffe hotel to my friends and would differently stay again if I ever travel back to NYC,
7,Great hotel and excellent staff!!!!!!,This had to be one of the best and most pleasurable stays at a hotel.  From the minute we pulled up at the front of the hotel and were greeted by the bellman.....until the time we checked out.  Everyone is so friendly and very knowledgeable of the area.  We loved the room and all the amenities| breakfast| wine and cheese!!!!  We enjoyed a few drinks on the rooftop bar as well.  All in all it was a great stay and we will definitely be back again soon.,
75,We'l be back!!,I have to say this was the best hotel I have ever stayed in.  From the moment we walked in the door we were made to feel welcome.  The front desk| the doormen| housekeeping| every single person that we dealt with was pleasant and helpful.    We had one of the two room terrace suites which was perfect because two people were from the US and one of us from Europe and with the jet lag having two separate (and good sized!) rooms worked out well since one of us was awake with jet lag every night at 2:30.  Our only complaint| and it is so tiny that I am still giving five stars| is that there are not enough hooks in the bathroom to hang wet towels.  When three people are staying in a suite| the towels add up and we really didn't have anyplace to put them.  Will be back in the spring!,
77,another great Kimpton hotel in flatiron district,grreat location| great room| well ecorated| very comforable bed| decent wine/cheese eveing happy hour - free; very helpful staf. really enjoyed our experience here,
11,The best place to stay in NYC,Just returned from a long weekend in the city for a family wedding- could not have stayed at a better place| location was excellent- we walked everywhere and felt a part of the bussle of the city. The staff were stellar- felt very welcomed when we arrived and throughout our stay- great breakfast and happy hour- surprise turn down service in our room which had a balcony overlooking the street. Will definetly return- quaint with class- exceptional service- Asim| Jose| Simone and the rest!! Thank you to all!!,
8,Lovely hotel,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  Staff are great| room large and comfortable.  Rate included breakfast and early evening drinks.  Free wifi too.  This hotel gets it right.  Others should take note.,
28,Excellent hotel .,Great location loved the nightly wine and cheese perfect after a long day of sightseeing  And shopping. Very calming at the end of the night to walkminto your room and experience the Turn down service the hotel gave. Great staff and would definitely come back.  Just a little hint try and get a higher floor........less road no ice,
35,Can't wait to return to Hotel Giraffe,I stayed with my 9-year old daughter and her friend at Hotel for Giraffe for a week at the end of June. While there are many good hotels and lots of choice in NYC| what makes Hotel Giraffe a standout is the unparalleled level of service and warm welcome we received not only on check in but every day| from the front office staff| to the doorman| to the lady who set out breakfast in the morning right through to the housekeeping team. Nothing was too much trouble whether we needed extra towels| help with directions or advice on what to do with our day. Front office manager| Asim Burondker| deserves special recognition for his exceptional service.  We stayed in a Terrace One Bedroom Suite| and it was lovely. The rooms aren't enormous| but are well-appointed and very comfortable| and…,
1,Recommend Hotel Giraffe,We had a great 3 nights at Hotel Giraffe - two adults and two kids.  The staff was very friendly and the lobby was inviting.  The complimentary breakfast was better than expected and the wine/cheese hour was very nice| with piano player in the lobby.  The complimentary bottle of red wine was greatly appreciated when we arrived the first evening.  It was a bit more expensive than similar hotels - especially the cost of parking a car.  However| the breakfast and location made that worth while.  Ask for a Juliet balcony with a view of Park Avenue.,
70,Nice hotel| great free breakfast,I have only stayed at two hotels in. New York so have little comparison. This one was good| with a reasonably sized room| quite comfortable. Location in midtown is ok| but if I headed back to new York I'd stay I soho instead as the area immediately round the giraffe is a bit dull. You are only 5 mins walk from some nice park and restaurants though. Our only issue with the hotel was that the sheets weren't clean on our arrival. And the replacement sheets we has to fit ourselves had holes in. However the staff were friendly and the free breakfast was great for people like us who don't need a full cooked breakfast. They have bagels and croissants and fruit and yoghurt and it's delicious| good quality.  Tip: maybe check their hotel website for deals as we felt the rate we paid on…,
15,Fun and Stylish,This is the best hotel I have stayed in in New York and I've stayed in a few.  From the moment you arrive you feel you are being taken care of by friendly staff who genuinely care. The reception area is attractive| bright and airy. My room (suite) on the tenth floor was excellent in every respect and had a useable balcony. The room was tastefully furnished and had extra touches such as iPod dock| DVD player| proper multi-channel TV (not a hotel variant)| soft bathrobes| slippers| paraben-free toiletries and even a selection of books.  A good bottle of red wine was a nice welcoming gift.  In the evening free cheese and wine is served in the lobby - both of excellent quality and the continental buffet breakfast was fresh and plentiful.  We also ate at the rooftop bar - uber cool…,
36,Great Hotel| Great Location.,"This is a lovely small hotel in Midtown| so you can walk to all of the ""must sees"". Metro also close. Hotel itself is modern| but charming. Rooms are a good size with nice touches such as iPod docs. Double glazing very efficient| so quiet. The buffet area in the lobby is a great addition| especially for us Brits who where wide awake at 5am | so could grab a muffin and a coffee| and be out to see the sights before the crowds. General tip| take advantage of the jet lag| and get out early to avoid the queues to the main attractions. Hotel staff pleasant and helpful at providing local knowledge and recommendations.  In summary| great place to stay in NYC| this will be first option on any return trips. Check out the Gramercy Tavern across the way for great food| cocktails and…",
9,Great Location and Staff,This is a really great little hotel.  I really would have put 4 1/2 stars| but that wasn't an option.  Great price| location and staff.  It was also quiet in my room and they provided an in-room iphone player| so I could play my sleep machine app.  The A/C worked very well| which is not true of every small hotel in NY!  They also provide a wine and cheese spread in the early evening that was wonderful!  I never ate breakfast there| as I like a hot breakfast and don't eat gluten.  However| Les Halles is just a short walk (Anthony Bourdain's restaurant) and it has a fabulous breakfast and coffee.  I ate breakfast there every day!  They will provide passes to workout at New York Sports Club| they work at any location and thought the Rockefeller Plaza one was the best.  The only…,
43,Wonderful boutique hotel.,This place was outstanding. Great location - nice and quiet compared to Times Square area. Very close to subway and walk able to EVERYTHING you must see in NYC. Free wifi and breakfast was most welcome and in terms of $$ - excellent value (NYC accomm prices are ALL high!). Enjoy :),
10,Wonderful Experience!,My wife and I just spent the last weekend at the Hotel Giraffe on 26th st. in Manhattan. As soon as we stepped out of our cab and were greeted by Jose the doorman we knew we were in for a wonderful experience. It is a small intimate hotel that is Big on making you feel that you are very special. The wine and Cheese served in the lobby was a added treat. We in particular enjoyed the new rooftop bar-very nice place for a cocktail before or after dinner. As an aside| our children joined us for dinner at Bread and Tulips and had a great dinner in a very relaxing setting. A hidden gem. Overall| We plan on staying at the Giraffe many more times.  WilliamR1954,
9,Excellent!,It's so tough to find a good place to stay in NYC that has a good price and accommodation and location. The rooms were AMAZING! The bathroom is huge and the shower was great! The size of the room was great too| especially for NY! The location is nice| not too far from downtown or uptown and super close to the 4/5 which can get you to most key places in the city. Within walking distance there are nice parks and great restaurants. By far though| the rooftop bar was my favorite and is a must! The staff are great and the atmosphere up there is wonderful - great drink variety too! I would definitely recommend to a friend and would stay here again!,
8,Fantastic,Despite a rocky start - put in a room on the 6th Fl. where the paint was stripped and was being redone and smelled like chemicals| and check in was an hour late - the staff was friendly and helpful and the room my daughter and I ultimately got on the 11th Fl. was great.  A wedding was going on on the rooftop deck on the 12th Fl. one evening but ended at around 11 PM.  The room was clean and new| as was the bathroom.  Very modern and nice bed and linens.  Loved the bright windowed lobby with comfortable| stylish furniture| and the continental breakfast and wine and cheese.  Too hot to enjoy the wonderful balcony!  An amazing find for the money in a great location in NYC.,
5,fabulous,"After checking out many of the ""hot boutique hotels"" in a New York Times review| none compare to Giraffe. We even aborted the list and went back to Giraffe. The value and service is unparalleled. Champagne| wine  and hors devours on the cool rooftop| complementary bottle of  wine| truffles and classic hardcover book waiting in room| The  breakfast is perfect.  The staff very  pleasant and professional. And wait| they give you bottled water (and more  chocolates) with turn down service!!!Where else? The price of the stay is affordable and the Giraffe truly delivers| and then some.",
4,The little 'extras'!,Stayed here for 4 nights over the 4th of July. Had a fantastic stay. Our room with balcony was everything we anticipated and more. However it was the little extras including the substantial continental breakfast and evening prosecco and cheese that really makes this place special.,
29,4th of July at the Giraffe,What a pleasant New York experience! We had a 5 day visit to the city| and after sight seeing and walking for hours each day| we were totally spoiled by coming back to this lovely hotel each afternoon. The friendly doorman greeted us with a smile| and we enjoyed wine or champagne along with tasty hors devours as we listened to the live piano music and enjoyed the ambiance of this lovely hotel lobby. Our room was spacious| modern| and looked exactly like the photos on the web site. Great bathroom. It was too hot to enjoy the rooftop garden| although it was lovely and quiet. Breakfast was very nice| with delicious fresh fruit and lots of baked goods| as well as hard boiled eggs| juices| coffee| tea. Cappuccino| cafe a lait| expresso were also offered. Free passes to the…,
1,awesome place and people,i stayed at the hotel giraffe and their other place the casablanca and both myself and my fiance loved both places. great vibe| service| and accomodations. quiet and clean and updated and pretty. i look forward to staying there again. def consider it| you wont be dissatisfied.,
67,Fabulous!,It's my 5th time in NYC and this was by far the best hotel I've stayed in.  Big rooms| good shower| friendly staff| great location| scrummy breakfast| great rooftop bar| lots of added extras like cheese and wine afternoons| free wifi| use of robes and slippers and a late check-out of 1pm...  what more could you ask for?  I booked this hotel for my partners birthday so had high expectations based on the ratings as I wanted everything to be perfect - and it truly was.  I will definitely recommend The Hotel Giraffe to others and will definitely stay here again.  Thank you.,
2,This is the way to stay in NYC,I chose Hotel Giraffe for my second trip to NYC. The first time I stayed was in a huge hotel in Times Square. I will NEVER visit again without staying in a boutique hotel. Hotel Giraffe has an excellent location on Park Ave. It is far enough away from the craziness| but close enough for you to walk most anywhere you want. The staff is amazingly friendly and service is fast. We called for extra towels a couple of times and they were at our door within 2 minutes. You don't get THAT at a huge| overly crowded TS hotel! The hotel is clean. I travel a lot and am super picky about this. The wine and cheese at night is nice| as is the rooftop area. The morning breakfast is great to grab on your way out. Even the coffee is pretty good. I'm picky about that| too. I will stay here again.…,
353,A fantastic value!,We just spent the weekend at Hotel Giraffe and had a lovely stay. From check-in to check-out| the experience was flawless. We arrived quite early in the day| but reception was happy to store our bags and graciously offered us the continental breakfast. When our room was ready (3 hours early) we found our bags already there. We were a bit concerned that traffic noise would be a problem since our room faced Park Ave. however we slept very soundly. Every member of the staff we encountered during our stay was very friendly and helpful while the wine & cheese reception was a relaxing pre-dinner experience. This was our first visit but it won't be our last!,
25,Best service ever.,My wife and I just completed our first stay in NYC and we choose the Hotel Giraffe due to other reviews| location and amenities.    This was by far the best service we have received from any hotel.  The accommodations were exactly as advertised| however the staff were all just fantastic.   Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Manhatten.,
205,Familiar Flawless Staff,The Hotel Giraffe has many amenities to recommend it. Location is wonderful near Madison Park and just north of Union Square. Best restaurants around it. But what sets this hotel apart is the continuity of friendly| professional staff that have been there for years. That's the mark of great management.   Carol & Gary Levine Northampton| Massachusetts,
19,It's the little things that matter| and they get them right!,Our greeting by Simona at the front desk and Jose at the bell station set a great tone for our stay at Hotel Giraffe.  We arrived too early to check in| but were welcomed to hang out in the lobby| and help ourselves to the complimentary treats| ice water| and delicious coffee drinks available. We snacked up| then headed out into the hot hot hot day to explore. That ice water sure hit the spot when we came back! We checked into out spacious one-bedroom suite with a view of the New York Life building off our little balcony. The kids recognized the gold pyramid topping it from Ghostbusters (are you the key master?)  The room was spotless| and well appointed. Lots of closet space| comfy beds| books on the shelves| and free bottles of water. Loved it. Only complaint was that the wavy…,
33,Brilliant introduction to New York,We spent 9 days at the Hotel Giraffe over Christmas 2011.  Our room was lovely with sophisticated decor and enough space for us to settle comfortably during our long stay.   The bathroom had a good shower.  The hotel has a friendly atmosphere helped by the use of the lobby for continental breakfasts| wine and cheese and all day coffee.  The location was really good| a couple of blocks away from Madison Square Park| a block away from 28th Street subway station. We ate at Bread and Tulips | a restaurant affiliated to the hotel in the cellar of the building| on our first night and the food and service were good.  There were also several excellent restaurants nearby such as A Voce (Madison) and Tamarind.,
11,Amazing place for a honeymoon!,We moved to the Giraffe after a disappointing stay at another hotel.  We couldn't have had a better stay.  The hotel location is great (for shopping and tourism) and our room was superb.  It was lovely to have a balcony over Park Avenue South.  We also really enjoyed the roof terrace bar.  Very good staff and the evening meet and greet is such a great idea.  We will definitely stay again.,
12,Hotel Giraffe,I stayed at the Hotel Giraffe with my teenage daughter in June 2012 and we just loved the hotel.  Staff were very friendly| especially the door staff| who were always cheerful and happy to hail cabs.  Our room had two double beds and a balcony and was on the eleventh floor.  Incredibly clean room| very comfortable beds and good quality bed linens.  The bathroom was lovely also and the room felt spacious.  The iPhone dock was a bonus and we loved the turn down service| which was very relaxing.  Cheese and wine in the evenings was very welcome and a lovely variety of cheeses and salad vegetables.  Breakfast was fantastic considering that it was included in the room price and the fruit salad was especially good.  We found lots of local eateries and particularly enjoyed Shake Shack.…,
51,Great Experience,Starting with the doorman holding the door for me as I walked in| the Hotel Giraffe was everything I had read. I won't go into specifics| as they have all been covered in previous reviews. Suffice it to say we really enjoyed our time there. The staff was open to advice regarding providing better gluten free options for breakfast| but for the wine/cheese offering| they were prepared openning up a new package of GF crackers for her to enjoy. Rooms facing Park Ave can be a bit noisy| we were on the 3rd floor and when we walked in| I thought the balcony doors were open. Then again| after a day of sightseeing in NYC| we were asleep the moment our heads hit the oh so comfortable pillows.,
2,Another great stay,Have just returned from our second stay at Hotel Giraffe and it was almost 100% perfect. The room was great and I appreciate being allowed to smoke on the balcony (with the doors closed behind me). This is the main reason we choose this hotel but there are numerous other good reasons for staying here; the location| the friendly staff - especially the lovely lady who served the wine etc of an evening| the attention to detail - it was my daughter's birthday and we were left a complimentary bottle of wine| the roof garden and the inclusive breakfast. The only negative was that being in room 1105 we were directly under the roof garden and although we were not disturbed by the drinkers|the clip clop of feet as the area was tidied up and the scrapping noise as tables and benches were…,
27,Very happy with our choice!,We spent our honeymoon here and could not have been happier with our choice. The location is fantastic as it very close to the subway but also there is a lot within walking distance. The room was not a bad size| especially considering the size of room I have seen in New York before| the bed was huge. We didn't get a balcony and we were facing an office block but otherwise this was a great room for the price we paid. I would not have been able to afford one of the rooms with a view up 5th avenue but maybe we could do another time once we've saved up lots! The breakfast was basic but more than appreciated - I know there are alot of hotels in NY where you don't get breakfast included. There are no tea and coffee making facilities in the room which is a small gripe but you can get…,
4,A quiet oasis in a bustling city!,Everything about this classy hotel adds to the NYC experience.  After running around the City all day there is nothing better than coming back to the hotel and having a cold beverage in the contemporary| cozy roof top garden| or a cup of cappuccino and a bit of chocolate in the peaceful| elegant lobby.  I have never met a more pleasant and accomodating staff; everyone wore a smile| asked about our day and engaged in conversation.  They could not have been more helpful| from the concierge| Jose| to the ladies serving drinks on the roof.  The rooms are clean| crisp and comfortable.  The color scheme is as restful as the bed and pillows.  The location was perfect for all of our sightseeing needs and we had easy access to the subway. We will definitely be using this hotel again and…,
47,Great Hotel,Unable to stay in it's sister hotel the Casablanca we chose the Giraffe and so glad we did. Located in an excellent location (26th and Madison) close to subway stops this is a top hotel. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Rooms are large and airy which is a godsend in New York. Bed was very large and comfortable. All the amenities in the room were good| TV showing ESPN (great for Euro 2012)| the ipod docking station and even the toiletries.  A very good breakfast comprising of all types of bagels| breads| pastries| eggs and a fresh fruit salad is included in the price as is a cheese and wine evening every night apart from Sunday from 5 to 8. Would recommend this hotel for any type of stay and when returning to New York we will stay here again. As a side note I have read some…,
165,Funny name but serious contender for your dollars.,We picked this hotel for its location to Madison Square Park for the Big Apple BBQ Block Party.  It's got a funny name and we were not sure what to expect.  Boy| were we surprised.  The level of service and attention to detail was outstanding.  The lobby is gorgeous and its where folks congregate for the complimentary breakfast and cheese service daily.  You could eat off the floor this place was so well cared for.  We arrived early| so our room was not ready.  the bell staff took our bags and called us to let us know our room was ready.  We went up to our room to find our bags ready for unpacking and no waiting or tipping needed.  You immediately sensed the staff cared about their guest and wanted to make you feel welcomed and spoiled.  They staff went out of their way to make…,
17,Loved everything about it,"I am super picky about my hotels and always do an exhaustive search to find just the right place. The Giraffe was it. What was great: location on Park and 26th| the charming roof top garden| the convenience of the complimentary breakfast| loved the Lattes| the complimentary  happy hour after a long day of sight seeing. I am an interior designer so I scrutinize the hotels I stay in and the Giraffe was updated| comfortably elegant| and in with todays ""less is more"" style of decor. To wrap it up| the staff was helpful and courteous| loved the hostesses that served breakfast and wine with a smile. Most importantly of all| the rooms were clean with good quality linens and we loved the french doors to the balcony. We will definitely stay again!",
2,The best hotel in NYC!,I have stayed in numerous hotels in NYC over the years (The Hudson| The Grammercy Park Hotel| W| Roger Williams| The Chelsea Hotel| etc) and have to say that The Giraffe was by far my favorite.  I was greeted upon arrival only to find that they upgraded my room (without me asking)| and was spoiled to a complimentary cocktail hour of wine| cheese and snacks.  The room was incredible...high ceilings| really nice modern decor| big bathroom| plenty of closet space and the most comfortable king size bed!  I forgot my toothbrush and housecleaning brought up a new one within 3 minutes of my call.  I was lucky to get a room on a high floor so it was really quiet and I got a great night's sleep.  They had valet parking (so I did not have to stress about finding a spot for my car) and…,
50,Fantastic Hotel,My husband and I toured the city last fall searching for a great place to host family and friends for our son's June 2012 wedding.  We visited many hotels and decided Hotel Giraffe would be the best choice for ourselves and our guests from out of town.  We worked with Emily White touring the hotel and to make all the arrangements and we felt very confident things would go well.  Emily was efficient| prompt  and upfront with answers to questions| happy to make any necessary changes| and she made us feel warm and welcome through the entire process.    We just returned from the wedding weekend and we couldn't be happier with our choice of hotels.  Our guests really loved the location| the rooms and all the amenities| and the whole staff was so friendly and accommodating.  Here are…,
5,Small details| big impression,I and a coworker stayed for two days and really appreciated the little things done by staff to make the stay memorable. For example| we checked in before the rooms were ready so left our luggage and found something to eat nearby. While out we received a text saying the rooms were ready. Upon returning our bags had been placed in our rooms already. On the second day it was raining and the staff was prepared with umbrellas at the door ready to hand out to guests as they left for the day. These small things add up to one big impression!,
58,Perfect anniversary,The Giraffe was everything we could have wanted for a 5-day anniversary celebration in NYC. The staff was top-notch. The hotel is new and immaculate. The rooftop garden is a treasure - we'd take breakfast or a nightcap up there and often have it to ourselves - very romantic| and it made us feel like millionaires. The location is great| 2 short blocks from the subway| close to convenience stores & pharmacies for all those practical items| as well as a number of nice eateries| coffee shops & bars. Thanks again to the staff for leaving a bottle of wine as an anniversary surprise. Only two (minor) suggestions for improvement (should management review these postings): 1 - leave a bit of room in the fridge for guest items instead of packing it with room service goodies; and 2 -…,
2,Best boutique hotel in New York,My wife and I live in Long Island and consider the Giraffe to be our home in the city. The rooms are large| immaculate and the service can not be more accommodating. Special kudos to Ashley| the hotel's manager for helping make our two days in the city a truly memorable mini vacation,
210,Excellent Hotel,A very good welcome from the reception staff set the tone for this well run hotel. From the doormen to the cleaners everyone was friendly and keen to make our stay as good as possible.  Comfortable smart rooms with good facilities and even a small balcony that improved the view. The breakfast was excellent and the 24 hour hot drinks and cookies was very much appreciated.  The cheese and wine (good quality in all respects especially the Prosecco) was a quality touch as was the piano playing. Well located with plenty of local eating places but far enough away to be quiet and Madison Square Park only a two minute walk this hotel delivers in so many ways.,
14,Very good the 2nd time also,Three days in New York at the end of April. Usually we try different hotels when we visit NY. This time we decided to return to Giraffe and we are happy we did. Pleasant staff| nice room| tasty breakfasts and a good location.,
139,Unexpected Surprise!,Hotel Giraffe is located on an up and coming section of Park Avenue. There are plenty of great restaurants within 5 minutes walking distance from Hotel Giraffe. There is a fun energy in this section of town. There are balconies off many of the rooms - outdoor space in New York is a rarity. We utilized Hotel Tonight App on the iPhone to book a last minute hotel room at Hotel Giraffe. We got a great price at the last minute. The hotel staff at check in were very friendly. When we checked into the room| there was a bottle of Mondavi red wine| free of charge| two bottles of water free of charge as well. We had a full balcony (shared with the room next to us - but there were plants used as a divider - and we never saw our neighbors). Hotel Giraffe has a full service restaurant…,
1,Very accommodating for a family with a baby,We had a fantastic 9 day stay at the Giraffe Hotel from 30 May. We have a 10 month old and the hotel staff were very welcoming and went out of their way to make life easier for us. The location is great - quiet but walking distance (with a pram) to the subway| great restaurants| parks and attractions such as the Empire State Building. Included continental breakfast was a great way to start the day! Free wi fi as well. We would highly recommend the hotel and will return soon hopefully. Thanks again to all the staff at the hotel.,
94,Excellent hotel,This is a superb boutique hotel| in an excellent location. Plenty of cafes/bars nearby| easy access to the underground and a ready supply of passing taxis. Rooms were lovely| a good size and very clean. Free wi-fi worked perfectly. There was a usb port in the alarm clock which allowed us to charge our camera etc easily| i- pod dock and radio which was put on to calming music every evening during the turn-down service. The staff were friendly and helpful at all times. The continental breakfast was so good we had it every morning during our stay. There was plenty of  drawer and hanging space for clothes with ample hangers for a long weekend stay. I would definitely stay here again if I get the chance to return to New York. This hotel comes highly recommended.,
1,5*,From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the staff were fantastic and could not have been any more helpful! The hotel is beautifully kept and spotless at all times. The cheese and wine spread in the afternoon is a real treat and much needed after walking round New York all day which the hotel is in the perfect location for. We would absolutley stay there again. 10/10,
11,Outstanding!,Met friends from LA at Hotel Giraffe. We both were upgraded to suites that included a living room. Everything was first rate with beautiful linens on the beds and great towels in the bathroom. All of the employees were proud of their hotel. From the moment we entered the boutique hotel until the time we departed the staff was charming. Gorgeous roof deck. Included was a self serve continental breakfast with fresh fruit| many choices of pastries and breads| cereals| teas and juices. The expresso machine| cookies| lemon water and fruit were always available. Wine| cheese| and fresh vegtables were available at 4PM. There was also a pianist. Beautiful lobby to relax in and enjoy life. We did not want to leave!,
65,Excellent hotel in good location.,This was our first visit to NYC for over 20 years and what a difference! The streets felt completely safe (as did the subway) and people were friendly and helpful. The hotel is well located for getting around Manhattan and the immediate area had some lovely restaurants and bars. The hotel itself looks and feels new (not sure how old it is) but the furnishings were all fresh| clean and contemporary. The communal area near the lobby was comfortable and relaxed and we took advantage of the daily afternoon complimentary wine and cheese. We were a family of four including two teenage kids and booked a room with two queen sized beds. The room was adequate space-wise but storage space was a little cramped for 4 people. There was the option of booking two rooms| which would have given…,
47,A great experience,This was the first time that we had stayed at the Giraffe Hotel.Normally we stay at the Metro but that was undergoing work. It is on Park Avenue South and East 25th. Perhaps it is a little further away from the main action and a few blocks from Penn Station but it more than made up for that in the quality of its rooms and breakfast. For New York it was also quite quiet. Our bedroom had a little balcony so we could overlook the street action. There is also a roof terrace but because the hotel is only about 12 storeys you don't get much of a view| however it is a nice place to sit with a drink. The breakfast is excellent with fresh fruit salad| yoghurts| bagels| toast| croissants| boiled eggs and a variety of drinks -teas| coffee etc. There are proper plates and cutlery and the…,
31,A pleasent hotel in NYC,We booked this hotel based on a recommendation. The staff were friendly| the hotel was quite & clean. The continental breakfast was excellent and the wine and chees during the week was much appreciated. Short walk  to subway & midtown attractions.   We had to upgraded the room as soon as we arrived as the allocated room on the 5th floor was small| dark & only had one double bed for 2 female tourists. When we have been to USA previosly the Queens are 6ft wide & Kings are 5ft wide. In UK| Queens are bigger| in US Kings are bigger hence why all the confusion here. We moved to a room with 2 king-size beds & balcony on the 11th floor. It was WOW!  but we did have to pay the extra fees as there was no jesture of goodwill from the management for the confusion.   We found the frosted…,
4,Very Enjoyable Stay,We booked a suite and enjoyed the cleanliness of the rooms| the amenities and the friendly service. The location and the breakfast were excellent. Our only disappointment was the diminished privacy| in that the living area of the suite faced an air shaft and looked directly and closely into some office buildings. There were only shades and it was very dark with them down. It would have been nice if there were some sheer drapes to mitigate the fish bowl feeling. Same with the bedroom. There were only shades and you could see into the office buildings across the street. Sheers would have been helpful so that we didn't feel so self-conscious| yet had natural light in the room.,
2,Hotel Giraffe,Clean room and bathroom. Comfortable king sized bed with nice new sheets and comforter. No bedbugs. Complimentary robes and bottled water. Large LCD HDTV. Helpful friendly staff. Wonderful breakfast and evening cocktails/cheese as well as late night cookies. We were upgraded to a suite (without request) which was a great surprise. Close to everything with convenient subway access just a block away. Will definitely stay again in future trips to NYC.,
75,Great Place to Stay in NYC,Just returned from a week in New York| staying at the Hotel Giraffe.  It is an excellent small hotel in the heart of the city. Very central for visiting all the main sites| and easy walking distance to many of them. Whilst it is situated on busy Park Avenue| it is a very calm and quiet place to relax inside the hotel. A simple but nice breakfast is served in the lobby....(as is a free cheese and wine event each day from 6:00pm to 8:00pm...a very nice touch). A fairly small but pleasant roof garden is open for evening drinks. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,
1,BEST BOUTIQUE HOTEL IN NEW YORK CITY,We have been staying at this hotel for several years and since facilities and the staff are so outstanding we no longer even think of staying elsewhere.We stay here between 4 and 6 times each year.,
7,Best boutique hotel in NYC,Stayed there two nights over Memorial Day.  We mentioned it was our 40th wedding anniversary and they gave us a complimentary upgrade to a suite.  The staff is super attentive. The rooms are comfortable and nicely decorated.  It is a quite hotel with a nice relaxing and quiet lobby.  The breakfast is great as is the wine and cheese bar every night.   This was our second stay and we will now not stay anywhere else when in NYC.,
1,Excellent Hotel| Excellent Value,I've stayed in many hotels in Manhattan. Hotel Giraffe is up there with the best of them| but at a fraction of the cost. Staff are polite and friendly| the room was bigger than expected for the City and in excellent condition. Free wifi worked great and breakfast was refreshingly simple and fresh. For a business traveller like me| they have got everything spot on to make a stay stress free and a pleasure. No question where I'll be staying there next time I go to New York.,
136,A Great Value| Staff and Comfortable,I have traveled regularly to NYC for several decades at all budgets. It is frustrating to try to find a place that is quiet| comfortable| spotless| with a great staff| updated and efficient for less than the cost of my monthly house payment. I think the Giraffe delivers on all of these. Too many well known hotels are simply noisy| a little frayed around  the edges| have just OK staff. I can endure any of those things| but what is really bugging me these days is how hotels offer an attractive basic rate but then get you with service fees for everything. At the Giraffe all the basics are included. For example you will read numerous posts about the nice breakfast in the morning| the wine and cheese at night and then later cookies. I appreciate the free papers (NYT| WSJ) and free…,
124,Great value,Ideally located|nice rooms and a roof terrace|perfect for smokers like ourselves The staff is very friendly|cozy atmosphere| breakfast served in the lobby| felt like a little bit being home far away.the only thing that could be improved are toilets in the lobby since you have to use your own bathroom in your room.Would certainly consider  to come back here,
3,Very Nice Hotel,Everything about this hotel is top quality. The room was clean and neat and nicely arranged. Continental breakfast was included and it was very good. There was a wine and cheese reception every night with several wines and cheeses| fruits and vegetables. Coffee and cookies were available all day in the lobby. The staff were very friendly and greeted us everytime we walked in the door. I will agree with another reviewer that the glass in the bathroom door was a little strange. I was staying in a suite with my brother and sister-in-law for my niece's graduation| so it was a little awkward.,
13,A very lovely hotel!,I booked this hotel based on the reviews that others had posted here and I was not disappointed.  The staff was friendly and professional from the moment that we checked in and we were immediately made to feel very welcome.  Unlike the big hotels| this hotel provided excellent amenities of considerable value-free wifi| delicious breakfast| a wine and cheese reception on Friday and Saturday night| bottles of water in the room and all day coffee service in the lobby.   I was recently in Las Vegas for business and after the shocking rip-offs at the casino hotels ($85 breakfasts| $10 bottles of water) this was all quite wonderful.    Our room was cute (slightly dark) but very comfortable.  We took the top floor suite on 12 next to the rooftop patio and thus my only (minor) complaint…,
180,Terrific!,We stayed at the Hotel Giraffe from May 14-19| 2012 (five nights). We were a family of nine| there to attend a graduation| so we had several rooms. I can't say enough about the wonderful staff and services. A great breakfast in the morning to get you fortified for your long day of walking New York. An awesome cheese and wine happy hour in the late afternoon/early evening to relax after your long day and get you revitalized for your evening. We especially enjoyed meeting up with family and sharing our days activities with one another during this time. The staff at breakfast and happy hour got to know us and knew what we wanted before we had to ask. Every single staff member will go out of their way to help you feel comfortable and at-home. The front desk staff always greeted us…,
14,My favorite NYC hotel,This hotel ticked every box for us. Friendly| helpful staff. Quiet. Clean. Elegant but chic decor - lots of muted colors| dark wood| granite. (The only thing that didn't make sense was the glass panel on the bathroom door. It's frosted| but still awkward if you bring guests up for a drink. This is not an enormous problem| but something to be aware of when you use your room for potty breaks when you're hanging out with friends touring the city.) It's a little pricey| but this level of accommodations with all the extras - free continental breakfast (w/ hard boiled eggs)| lemon ice water| tea & coffee in the lobby all day| happy hour menu| free wifi| 2 bottles of water at turn-down| gym pass (though I didn't use this)  - are worth it. The rooftop bar is a fantastic spot for resting…,
117,Friendly hotel with a guest house feel in midtown,We really enjoyed our 10 day stay.  the continental breakfast was excellent and the wine and chees during the week was much appreciated. It is quite a small hotel but our suite was quite spacious.  The reception staff were helpful as well - though this did vary according to who was on duty.,
31,Took wonderful care of our family,We have stayed at the Hotel Giraffe before. This time we stayed for three nights for our daughters graduation. This hotel is wonderful. The staff are friendly and helpful. They try to accommodate all your request. (which they did for us) This is the only hotel that my husband can get a good nights rest. Love this hotel. Will always stay here when visiting NYC.,
2,Lovely hotel,We stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for a week. We really enjoyed it. The hotel is great| staff are helpfull and friendly. We would love to stay there again. We can recommend it to everyone that's looking for an oasis to relax in in the big| buisy and amazing city.,
2,Great hotel| perfect location,Just returned from a part business - part leisure trip to NY and stayed at the Hotel Giraffe.  It was the perfect hotel for my needs since I traveled with my husband and 2 kids.  The junior suite was a good size.  The kids slept in the living room on the sofa bed and the hotel provided a crib for my toddler.  I was also delighted that they put a mini fridge in the room which was great for keeping milk and snacks cool for the kids.  Room rate includes breakfast (continental but very good selection of fresh food) and wifi.  Location was great in the Flatiron| near Empire State building| great restaurants| a park and Eataly.  Only wish we could have stayed longer.,
104,Great location - boutique hotel,We stayed 3 nights at the end of April. 2012. Our room was on the 5 th floor on the side street. Could see the intersection of Park Avenue but not troubled by the traffic noise.  Extremely comfortable bed and the room was a good size for New York and well appointed.  The bathroom could do with an update but it was clean and good water pressure.  Loved the wine and cheese available in the evenings.  A good way to wind down after sightseeing and  before heading out for the evening. Breakfast was ample with a selection of cereals| boiled egg| fruit and pastries .   Great location. Not in the tourist area so lots of great restaurants nearby . Try Blue Smoke and  Bhatti Indian Grill. A quick walk to Madison Square Park| 10 minutes to Macy's . Walked to the Highline from the hotel in…,
7,Terrific hotel,Other reviews have covered the features and benefits of the Giraffe in detail and there is little I can add. Location| rooms| cleanliness| facilities and staff ensured our ten night stay was a pleasure and I would not hesitate to return or recommend. If you are anything like we were - you are trawling through Trip Advisor reading hotel reviews weighing up opinions and value| all the while knowing that at some stage you are going to have to take a punt and trust not to be dissapointed - well enough already. Hotel Giraffe| you will not regret your choice !,
12,Great hotel| so many amenities| beautiful rooms,The Hotel Giraffe in Manhattan is great value for money. Good location - Just a couple of blocks from the subway| lovely restaurants walking distance| great place. The furniture| decoration and ambiance in general are beautiful| the rooms and bathrooms are very spacious. The breakfast is great| the staff are so helpful| ready to refill your coffee| prepare your toast... same thing with the snacks throughout the day. So many little details in the rooms and around the hotel| amenities all over the place| making you feel so special during your stay. Their roof garden is just perfect. We definitely loved this hotel| and would most definitely come back!,
1,Terrific staff,We stayed for four nights on the recommendation of friends and family and highly recommend the hotel.  It has a great location but is quiet.  The staff were extremely helpful and courteous| the rooms and facilities clean and well maintained and the breakfast was perfect for our needs.,
489,Good location & room| poor service,Well I decided to overnight here at  Least to find out why it is called Giraffe. In the room there is a 200 page book about giraffes. Quite an interesting read if you have even 20 minutes.    Starting from checkin: Very slow front desk and checkin process.   I was Promised room by 3pm which is checkin time but at 3.40pm the room was not ready yet as they needed to replace a curtain there.  I insisted that they replace while I am in the room.  Checkout was very fast though.   No concierge here (but one bellboy) so turning to reception for questions and problem solving.  Receptionist had 0 (none) knowledge about even basic things about New York.   Room itself is quite nice.  Clean| good size and with some amenities like iphone charger.    Lobby is not large but convenient for…,
15,Liked it,Stayed for one night in early May on a short business trip. I only booked the day before (Venere) so not the cheapest price| but nevertheless felt the Giraffe was still good value. All the important things covered - good sized comfortable & quiet room| free wi-fi| great breakfast and nice hotel staff who clearly enjoy what they do. Evening wine and cheese is a nice touch too.   Location is good with only a few minutes walk to sights and shopping at Macy's. Within a few steps are a selection of bars and restaurants which all looked good and front desk are happy to recommend. They will also book a car to the airport which is only slightly more than a taxi and definitely worth the extra in terms of comfort and low stress.,
38,Comfortable and Quiet,I stayed for 3 nights| April 24-26. I stayed in a suite for 2 nights which was an upgrade and decided to stay an extra night so they switched rooms to a double. Both very quiet and comfortable. Also took advantage of the morning breakfast which was convenient as well as early evening wine sampling which was a nice touch. I have booked a room again for my next NY visit on May 21-22. I hope it will be as pleasant a stay. Thanks for everything going along smoothly.,
25,Really enjoyed this hotel,I was here for a family girls weekend (4 aunts and 3 cousins). So we had 7 people staying in two rooms in this hotel. True to what I imagine most other Manhattan boutique hotels are like| the beds were small. Otherwise| this place was pretty great. Free breakfast. Nothing fancy| but cereal| pastries and fruit. Coffee available all day. Wine and cheese in the afternoon. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We mentioned that we were going to check out the High Line| and one of them got us 7 bottles of water to take along. Very attentive. Also the location is pretty convenient to everything| and the restaurant next door was really good also. Give yourself plenty of time if you are trying to catch a cab at rush hour. The staff will hail one for you| but it took forever because…,
114,Nice  hotel but now needs freshening up,This was our 4th stay in the hotel. Other reviewers have set out the good points i.e great buffet breakfast included in price as aredrinks and snacks in early evening and coffee and biscuits available in the lounge all day long. Breakfast can be busy and sometimes have to wait for a table to sit down. There is free wifi as well. It's a great location and close to good subway stations and plenty of the sights and shops are in easy walking distance. But the rooms are too dark and lighting in the rooms is quirky and just doesn't give enough light. Rooms  can be noisy regardless of what floor you're on and we've been on several but this is New York and those canyons just amplify any noise; nonetheless better windows would help. We found there was insufficient storage in our room;…,
6,Very friendly| close to attractions Boutique hotel,I stayed at the Giraffe hotel for a week at the end of April with my family| as it was my Dad's 60th birthday.  We arrived at the hotel at about 8pm (local time) and was totally exhausted| as we was obviously travelling all day.  The hotel informed us that our second booking had not been completed by our hotel provider and we only had one room.  We were obviously devastated and confused| as I made the booking well over 4 months ago.  The Giraffe hotel quickly smoothed over the situation and found us another room and gave us a complimentary bottle of wine| because of the error.  This was great| as it wasn't even there fault!  Overall| we found the stay at the hotel very pleasurable and very much enjoyed the continental breakfast that was available every morning.  It was enough…,
31,A true home away from home!!,"A girlfriends weekend| we spent nine nights at ""The Giraffe"" and had a wonderful time!  Always welcomed back by name when returning from shopping or dining....wonderful cheese & wine receptions| terrific breakfasts and superb staff.  Our suite was roomy with a small balcony| great beds| quiet and immaculate accomodations.  Miss it and will come back.  Exactly what we needd and more than we imagined.",
3,Fabulous hotel,Just returned from a week's stay at Hotel Giraffe| which was our first visit to New York. The hotel was perfect in terms of what we needed to make the most of our stay. Conveniently located for easy access to all parts of Manattan| Uptown and Downtown - and on the subway line for the museums of Upper East Side if that's your particular interest (it was ours!). The immediate area around the hotel was great| relatively quiet and with some lovely restaurants within easy walking distance. And the hotel itself met all our expectations - spaclous and quiet rooms (for the location)| friendly and helpful staff| great breakfasts| all day coffee/tea and afternoon cheese and wine| etc. If we return to New York| we would definitely stay at Hotel Giraffe again!,
46,Comfortable| great location| somewhat pricey,Pleasant boutique hotel in great location.  Staff are indeed friendly and helpful| even found a solution for my forgotten adapter. Pleasant atmosphere over breakfast and wine & cheese time which are included in the room rate. My 12th floor room was pleasant and functional and even had a little balcony. Downsides are the relatively poor noise insulation of at least my room and the basement level  hotel restaurant which is not exactly a cosy place for single travelers who would be better advised to seek other options in the area or order room service.,
6,Beyond Expectations!,From check-in to check-out| my experience was spectacular and the entire staff was personable and incredibly helpful.  The refreshments in the lobby| appetizers and drinks in the evening and  the free continental breakfast in the morning were truly a delight.  The room and amenities were well above average; slippers were a treat. It was my birthday and the staff went out of their way to make it special! Thanks Hotel Giraffe - we'll be back.,
156,Friendly Service,I was delighted to discover my room was available for early check-in at 9:30 am considering the damp cold day I was facing outside.  Check-in staff was pleasant and accommodating to my questions.  Bell staff was quick and exceptionally helpful with taxis and baggage.  Rooms were adequate| but could use a little freshening of decor.  The bed is hard as a rock and I didn't sleep well at all.  Nice shower pressure and plenty of bath linens.  Complimentary breakfast is served in the lobby and free wi-fi are nice perks that help offset the exhorbitant rate.  Location is awesome and lot's to do and see in the area.  Great restaurant/bar next door (in basement of building),
32,A very relaxing hotel.,Well just returned from a one night stay at  Hotel Giraffe.  Upon checking in I was immediately greeted.  I asked If they could possibly put me in a room with two beds.  After checking he apologized and advised all rooms with two beds were not available.  To my surprise he instead put me into a suite| that had a pull out couch and a king bed| living room| little bar.  The room was immaculate!  These are high quality rooms very expensive 8 foot solid interior doors| perfecting lighting| two LCD televisions| several books| robes| DVD system| stereo.  Just perfect in every detail.  While headIng to street noticed wine and cheese reception for the guests 5-8 pm  In the beautifful lobby. Red| White and Prosecco| olives| crackers| cheese| fruit...etc.  All on the house.  They also had…,
44,Perfect!,My husband| 14-year-old son and I just got back from our excellent two-night stay at the Hotel Giraffe in NYC.   Our stay was absolutely perfect . The service is impeccable| discreet and seamless. The staff is friendly| accessible and responsive. Everything went so smoothly during our stay--there was a calm order at the hotel that gave us immense confidence everything was going to go very well. No one was snippy| no one was grumpy--everyone was| as I said| responsive and attentive without any added flourishes of pretense.  The continental breakfast is gracious and nice--they have everything you could possibly want in a convivial atmosphere in the lobby. The evening happy hour is a great touch for when you just want a glass of wine and a bite of cheese after a day around town.  …,
1,Very considerate staaff,I booked a stay for two nights and found the staff very friendly and eager to please. The amenities are very enjoyable and the location is quiet. I have a chronic low back problem and let them know on check-in that I may not be able to stay the second night. They were very understanding and agreed to waive the early departure penalty. I would certainly return when I am able.,
22,A Wonderful Small Hotel,Immaculate| attractive and well equipped rooms.  Delicious| complimentary wine and cheese every afternoon + yummy breakfast included.  Staff that is totally helpful and friendly.  We were there for me to have outpatient surgery| and they did everything possible to make our stay comfortable.  If you have reason to be downtown on the east side| this is an excellent place to stay| and for NYC reasonably priced.  Also| as best as I can tell| it has never been cited for bedbugs| which was a big reason we chose Hotel Giraffe.,
13,Savior,I had just spent two weeks at another hotel (Affinia Shelburne) and it was a disaster| very average and then when i extended i had to leave.  I called Hotel Giraffe (across from my office) and they welcomed me with open arms.  The greeting when i arrived and every time i left or came back was as if i was an old friend.  Really makes you feel good!!  Continental breakfast served every morning.  If you pay $5 they will bring it to your room which worked out well for me.  I never made it to wine in the evenings but did grab some juice and cookies late one night.  When there was an issue with my air conditioning| someone came immediately.  A piece of paper got trapped and made a noise.    The rooms are nicely appointed and very comfortable.  I only wish i could have taken advantage…,
1,A great time!,This was the first time we visit New York and it was a great experience.  Giraffe is a nice hotel with a friendly staff and a good position.  The rooms were very clean but the bed a little to small for 2 persons.  When you stays for more than a few days| the wardrobe is also to small for 4 persons.  Breakfast was delicious but not so extensive.  The free snack and drink in the evening was a nice surprise.   Attend this is a positive critique and we certainly recommend this hotel to our friends.   Hilde| Debora and Yentl,
29,Comfortable stay,We had a nice stay when visiting New York with our two children| age 5 and 7. We felt welcome and were satisfied with the spacious and clean room. No noisy from rooms beside| under or over| but some noise from outside. Might be that the windows could be improved. Smiling and friendly staff. The breakfast is ok. It was a bit hard for small people to eat breakfast at a coffe table| would be better with dining tables. Wine and cheese in the evening was fantastic| we really enjoined the live music and good atmosphere accompaning it.,
1,A great spring stay at the Hotel Giraffe,Our wonderful experience began when I requested a large room for my wife and me and our twelve-year old twins.   The reservationist recommended room 706 and we could have the twins in the fold out sofa-bed.  He further recommended that if we pre-paid we would save close to 10%.  I agreed and our room was set.  When we arrived the room was ready and it was super!  It was large by any standards and HUGE by NY standards.  The bathroom was large too.  We had a small balcony over Park Ave.  The hotel's lobby was excellent and the afternoon snack was a welcome treat.  The staff were super friendly| professional (assisted with taxis and general subway directions) and courteous.   I big plus was the delicious breakfasts and the wonderfully cheerful women that staffed the breakfast…,
166,Amazing Hotel & Location,Stayed here 8th to 13th March to celebrate my wife's 50th Birthday and right from the moment we entered the hotel our experience was faultless.  In the build up to our departure I e-mailed the hotel several times with information requests and they responded really quickly and effeciently and were able to help me plan my wife's surprise.  We were very fortunate to be upgraded to a suite (room 806) and it was absolutely perfect with a balcony overlooking Park Ave. it was very spacious and it meant our 4 friends could join us after breakfast to plan our day. The hotel staff were also excellent at keeping the fact that our friends (with the same surname) were also staying at the hotel as a surprise to my wife and it meant she got the fright of her life when we met them at the top of…,
38,Great hotel but had a few niggles...maybe just bad luck,Having seen all the positive reviews we were very excited about our stay at Hotel Giraffe so maybe our niggles are due to overly high expectations.   The location is really excellent and the rooms are very comfortable. The housekeeping staff do a great job - the rooms are very clean| the turndown service is nicely done and there are plenty of fresh towels (although I can never understand why hotel towels have to be so small!). Breakfast is fine and it's nice to have access to tea/coffee all day. There's a nice atmosphere for evening drinks and it's good that they're complementary.  Our first niggle was to do with the check-in. Following the advice on TA| we'd requested two rooms high up the building and we had a friendly email acknowledging our request. When we checked in at 4pm…,
15,Another great stay at Hotel Giraffe,"It was our second time staying at Hotel Giraffe.  We found the room this time a little small and realized that our previous stay was in the king superior room rather that the queen.  The king definitely gives you a little more space.  My primary concern is cleanliness of the facility and they have this down!  The cost is reasonable (we used to stay at the ""W"" in Union Square until we stopped justifying the $500.00 + room charges).   The staff is very friendly| helpful and professional and you can't beat the location.  We're back in June for another stay!",
4,Super hotel,I spent five nights in Hotel Giraffe at the beginning of April. I had booked a suite because I was with two other adults and we felt that we needed a bit more space than a standard room would offer. We were thrilled with our choice. The beds were very comfortable and the view was lovely. We were on the seventh floor and got plenty of light too.  There were so many extra touches that made our trip so enjoyable. A beautiful complimentary breakfast was provided each morning. In addition| cheese and wine were provided during evening| tea| coffee and biscuits were available all day/ night. What a treat after a busy day!  The staff was so helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. From booking trips to calling taxis| everything was done with grace and a smile. A special mention for Pablo…,
120,What a great place to stay,Again| nothing more to add to the reviews by others. A great place to stay. We had a wonderful quiet room. Clean| roomy and a nice bathroom. Fantastic cheese and wine each evening. A marvellous breakfast each morning| preparing us before pounding the city streets. We liked the location| finding it positioned in the middle of the city very useful. There were loads of places nearby to eat. We'd certainly stay here again| what more of a recommendation could you have.,
83,Hotel Giraffe New York,Fabulous hotel| lovely comfortable spotlessly clean rooms. Added extras which make your holiday special are things like coffee| tea| juice| biscuits and fruits available all day plus continental breakfast and cheese and wine at night.  You can also use a computer and printer which is really useful| the hotel staff are friendly and helpful.  Quite close to all the attractions I would recommend this hotel if you want a luxury stay in NY. Quite expensive but definitely worth it for the cleanliness and luxury.,
25,A really lovely hotel,Hard to add to what other people have said about this hotel - it's fab.   There are a lot of small touches that show that thought has gone into making you feel welcome - for example the little chocolates left in the room every evening| the cheese and wine every evening with a pianist| generous breakfasts| tea/coffee on tap all day and a laptop with a printer in the lobby for guests to use.   The staff were really nice - not just front of house staff but housekeeping and other staff.  The location is excellent - an easy walk to the Empire State Building| Grand Central Station and the lovely farmers' market at Union Square. There's a subway a couple of minutes' walk away too| and lots of little local restaurants if you walk away from Park Avenue.,
76,We'll be back,My husband and I have just returned from a two week stay at Hotel Giraffe. We booked the hotel mainly for its location - away from the tourist crowds but still within walking distance of many attractions. The hotel is also located close to two subway stations| which is very convenient. We loved the neighbourhood. We enjoyed strolling through Madison Square Park and on to Union Square (don't miss the Green Market there!) We found many great bars and restaurants in the area near the hotel including Bread and Tulips (attached to the hotel) Blue Smoke Grill| Aselina| Primehouse| I Trulli and lots of others. Being close to Eataly was also a bonus!  The hotel itself was fabulous. We had a room with a king bed on the 8th floor| facing Park Ave. We were not bothered by street noise (we…,
10,Outstanding hotel !,My family and I have just returned from a 5 night stay in this hotel. The hotel is in a fantastic location. Whilst being close to everything it offers a calm oasis to the weariest of traveller. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful ( they even scanned a 24 page document for my husband without fuss).We booked a one bedroom suite as we were travelling with our two young children. We were delighted with our room. It was very big by New York standards. The four of us were very comfortable and had plenty of space. In future however| I would book a room in a higher floor| as ours tended to be quite dark ( the lounge/ sofa bed area looked into an office). We really enjoyed breakfast as it suited all of our party. The food was delicious| and the coffee was great. It was a great…,
98,Fantastic Hotel in a great location,Perfect boutique hotel offering personal service and great accommodation. Located close to the subway and lots of great places to eat. We had our three children with us and the two bedroom room was ideal for our family.,
33,Absolutely spot on. Wouldn't change a thing!,My friend and I visited NY for a 5 day shopping trip in Feb 12. I'd checked TA before booking this hotel and was mpressed with what people had to say. My friend owns and runs a boutique hotel so that was another reason I chose it.   We were both chuffed to bits with it. To start with| they'd already impressed me before we got there with their help. Another friend had wanted me to get him a Kindle cover that wasn't available in the UK. I emailed them and they answered all my questions (promptly) about was it best to get it shipped to them from Amazon.com or buy it in NYC when I was there. When I decided on the former| they kept it for me and presented it on arrival. No fuss| no hassle.  Also| we booked a superior room and they upgraded us to a suite - which was very| very nice. …,
8,Another excellent stay at the Giraffe,This was our second stay at the Giraffe and we were again very happy with the level of service and attention to detail.   The rooms were spotless and very comfortable.  Housekeeping did a superior job of daily cleaning.   Will be looking to another stay in the future.,
1,Owner of The Hotel Giraffe DOES NOT STAND behind their services either!,My husband and I stayed at the hotel the weekend of March 8th.  Shortly after check in my husband was notified by the hotel's General Manager that his car had been involved in an accident while the car was being driven from the hotel to the parking garage. Two estimates were promptly provided at the request of the hotel and the parking garage.  Since then my husband has followed up with hotel and parking garage multiple times to be given a total run around.  To date the matter remains unresolved.  What makes this experience even more distasful is that the Hotel's owner Henry Kallan called my husband and promised to look into the matter and get back to him.  We have not from Mr. Kallan or his staff since.  The handling of this matter is deplorable considering we are dealing with…,
14,Lovely hotel; lovely location; fabulous holiday,We stayed at this hotel in March 2012. The hotel is about a five minute walk to the Empire state building and is therefore a great location for going either North or South in the city. The boutique feel of the hotel is lovely with the complimentary wine and cheese in the evenings and the piano being played in the background| makes a great spot for relaxing after a long day out and before going out for dinner. The complimentary breakfast offered a healthy start to each day. We stayed in the Queen Room on the 11th floor| it had everything you could want but we felt it was starting to look a little tired and could do with redecorating. A shower curtain over the bath is never a good thing and it would have looked much better with a shower screen. You can hear noise from the city but…,
15,Hotel Giraffe Feb 12,"We thought it ironic to come all the way from Namibia (Africa) and stay in New York in Hotel Giraffe!  Although on internet and the first impression the hotel is not spectacular| it is very deceiving.  The service was very good| the rooms great!  I booked on the internet and all my requests like ""down pillows"" quiet room etc was taken in consideration.  It was my husbands birthday and they had a nice card and some Proseccu waiting in the room!   In the evening there was a selection of cheese and wines| and a pianist playing| really nice to relax before going out for dinner.  The rooms was big and even had a CD and DVD player in| very convenient!  Although the shower was in the bath| it was still spacious with enough space to pack toiletries.  They also had good guest amenities…",
80,Another pleasant stay,My husband and I just returned from New York City and stayed for the second time at Hotel Giraffe.  As usually we had a great time in NYC and looked forward at the end of the day to return to our very spacious room with a kingsize bed.  We visited the rooftop terrace one evening| there’s really nothing to see due to nearby buildings but it was nice to relax and enjoy a cocktail before heading out for dinner. The hotel itself is quite pleasant| complementary breakfast| the staff is exceptional| very helpful and cares about their guests.  We will stay here again.,
27,Groovy corporate near Union Square,Nice lounge| and up to standard rooms. Roof bar with no real views| but happening basement bar for younger guests.,
23,Don't love the name|but the hotel is great!,Recently stayed at this establishment for one night.     We were very pleasantly surprised to find a very nice facility with well appointed| and decorated rooms.   The street that the hotel is on has free street parking available in the usual New York fashion (you have to move your car twice during the week for one hour or so)| and we were able to secure a place right outside the hotel - literally.    Lovely staff and an excellent espresso machine (Cimbali) at the buffet breakfast just topped it off.   Would return.,
1,The Hotel Giraffe DOES NOT STAND behind their services.,Within half an hour of check-in I received a call from the General Manager at Hotel Giraffe informing me that my car had been involved in an accident while in their possession on the way to the parking garage.  Their attitude - not our problem - take it up with the parking garage as if they had no liability or responsibility for what happened. Neither the hotel nor the garage has paid for the damages eventhough repair estimates were promply provided.  While I recognize the fact that parking is an outsourced service - in this case Rapid Parking| Inc. - the hotel has not done anything to facilate resolution. I am extremely disappointed in the manner this matter has been handled and continues unresolved.  If you are looking for arrogance and complete lack of customer care in…,
120,quality / price !,we had a 4 floor room| with unfortunately too much street noise to leave the window open queen size beds are quite small even compared to European standards. rooms have all you need| anyway this is not a place to stay in your room. Hotel and staff are great| no remarks whatsoever.  the lobby doesn't have a soul| even with the free cheese and wine it never becomes a place to sit and relax for longer than needed. seems like a functional hotel with excellent quality for the price paid.,
1,Awesome First NYC trip!,First timer? New to NYC? Need a great hotel with great Service? Go here!! Hotel Giraffe was a perfect stay… Stayed 4 Nights Sat 3-10-12 Wed-3/14/12. Awesome Weather. Awesome Room! Whether you’re doing the subway thing| the walking thing| the cab thing| or limo thing| This Place was awesome. We did all four! We (My wife and I) did a long weekend| and it was magnificent.  We did 9/11 memorial (get tickets in advance [free])| David Letterman (get [also free] tickets in advance) Broadway show (Memphis*Awesome show drink n eat before you go). Subway stops on park ave are at 23rd street and 28th street…. So you gotta walk 2 blocks if you’re going uptown and 3 blocks if you’re headed downtown.  I think subway is a 2 bucks a person per trip. We each put 20 bucks on a metro card each….…,
18,Great hotel in NY,Stayed here for the night on a business trip. Good service| nice room (especially for NY standards). The room is quit spacious| has a good bed and all necessary facilities. Stayed at the 9th floor with not too much noise of NY... The 5 'o clock appetizer is a nice bonus| free wine and snacks if you have the time for it. Breakfast is sufficient but compared to European standards a bit basic. Good hotel overall,
117,Elysee was better,We stayed here for our last 2 nights (mid-Feb) in the US after a month long trip.  A few weeks earlier we had stayed at their sister hotel Elysee.  While Hotel Giraffe had a great location| that was really the only thing that made it better than Elysee.  Our room was quite noisy| after pulling out the sofa bed and we had 5 luggage bags there was no room to move| quite cramped| bathroom while very clean was quite small.  Maybe I was just used to the spacious suite that we had at Elysee.  The staff were abit more attentive and friendlier at Elysee and I preferred the privacy of the lounge on level 2 where breakfast/wine/cheese was served at Elysee compared to that being in the lobby at Giraffe.  I would recommend Elysee over Giraffe| but overall Giraffe was good.,
117,Fantastic hotel & great service,We stayed here in Nov last year and I can honestly say its one of the best hotels I have stayed in.  The reception staff were superb and full of recommendations for dinner.  They recommended the Shake Shack in Madison sq park and BLT prime| both of which were superb! The rooms were spacious for NYC and very comfy| with an added bonus of a balcony! There was turn down service but we generally declined the offer.  The breakfast was fantastic| with proper NY bagels on offer! There is no bar (or there wasn't when we stayed) which was probably the only negative comment I have.  Having said this| every night (except Sunday) they put on a cheese and wine reception between 5-8. They had a lovely selection of red| white and prosecco with an array of cheeses and biscuits to choose…,
1,we'll be back!!!,This hotel made us feel very welcome in a relaxed way|the rooms they gave us were excellent and with our own little hallway closed off by a door which meant that we could leave our doors open when we were in. Every evening between 5 and 8 there was free wine and cheese and that made coming back to freshen up very easy!! The staff were friendly and  helpful although the doorman was nearly always too late to open the door for you!! We will definitely be coming back to this hotel!,
12,Incredible value with all the perks,I just stayed four nights at Hotel Giraffe and it was really wonderful. My room was certainly very comfortable with every thoughtful convenience provided. But what I loved the most was the elegant| but really warm boutique feeling of the hotel. The staff was gracious| knowledgeable and sincerely kind. The wine reception each evening was an incredible perk -You can relax and sip some surprisingly good wine and nibble delicious snacks in their lovely lobby with couches and marble tables while a pianist plays old jazz on a grand piano. Similarly| the breakfast provided each morning was a delight| with all the important newspapers| and a fantastic selection of food including cappuccino| fresh fruit salad| cereal and yogurt| eggs and beautiful selection of breads and pastries.…,
420,The city never sleeps| and neither will you...,Hotel looks nice| room is clean and well appointed.  The bar was cool| and Paul was a great bartender.  That's about it.  I slept with tissue in my ears and pillows over my head| but still awoke frequently to sounds of traffic.  I know this is New York| but I also know they make widows that are much more effective (I checked to make sure they were closed).  Drinks in the minibar are not cold| not even cool.  The wireless internet did not work on my only morning in the hotel.  No turn-down service or ice in the room| but I did get in at 9pm.  Front desk was average at best| I had to wait quite a while during the check-in process while Sasha explained to someone on the phone that the pay-per-view was also not working.  But the room looks nice.  I will not stay here again| even at…,
446,Excellent service| rooms and location,I have tried many different hotels in NYC and I really liked this one. Front desk| bell boys and overall service staff is really nice. Rooms and bathrooms have a very good size| decor is fine| everything is clean.  I liked the location| close to two subway stations on the green line| close to Union Square and lots of restaurants| easy to get from there downtown or uptown. Breakfast is included as well as wine and cheese in the evenings.,
146,Comfortable hotel with a nice feel to it,Modern hotel with comfortable rooms just by Madison Square and close to subways (there is station access in the basement of the New York Life building across the road)| so easy to get anywhere. The hotel has a nice 'boutique' feel - not to brash and brassy or sterile| with a comfortable lounge that is also used for breakfast and| in the evening has complimentary wine and cheese and a pianist from 6 to 8. There is a coffee machine there so you can pop back for a coffee and a sit down whenever you want. The staff are friendly and helpful without being over-pushy.  We were a little unlucky because there was building work in an adjacent building that went right through the night for two of the five nights we were there and disturbed us. Anywhere in Manhattan will be a bit noisy but…,
83,Great 5 Nights in Central Manhattan,We had a great stay at this hotel.  Quiet on the 11th floor and great extras provided including the wine and cheese| chocolates at night| and very professional staff.  We are walkers and found Hotel Giraffe was central to the activities we were interested in -- Broadway shows| Greenwich Village and Eataly.  Couldn't have asked for better service or amenities.,
13,Really enjoyed it!,We loved the Giraffe - will definitely be back!  The rooms are big| but very cozy.  The hotel has a warm and welcoming feel in general.  Breakfast is really good (included)| so is the afternoon wine/snacks.  The location was perfect for us because it's a little out of the way of the crowds but still really close to many attractions (especially if you like walking| but the subway is convenient too).  We walked to a great Italian restaurant for dinner (Novita's).  In short| definitely the best place we've stayed at in NYC (we've been at the Hilton| Le Meridien| W).  Oh and the staff was very friendly and helpful too! Thanks for a great stay!,
214,M-A-RA-V-I-L-H-O-S-O,Service an staff were excellent|the staff were delightful from breakfast servers | to doormen| concierge - all were wonderful!!!!Room was clean and spacious .The Juliet balcony was a nice touch and although there wasn't too much to see out of it| it was nice to open to the doors and take in the city.Great location to walk to many sites.  Portuguese: Realmente recomendo como um LAR em NYC.Certamente retornaremos em breve.,
4,Excellent hotel,I had the pleasure of staying at Hotel Giraffe for 6 days and would definitely recommend staying here.  Service an staff were excellent| room was clean| spacious with all mod cons you would expect. Breakfast covered all of the basics well| and every day they had cheese and wine from about 5:30pm.  The hotel is in a really good area| lots of restaurants and bars close by| underground 1 block away and walking distance to empire state building.,
11,Perfect Stay,Rooms - We stayed in a deluxe guestroom with a king bed| which was perfect. The room was well laid out and very comfortable. The Juliet balcony was a nice touch and although there wasn't too much to see out of it| it was nice to open to the doors and take in the city.  Food - Breakfast could be a little chaotic but if you're patient you'll have no problems. Could maybe do with a few more tables and chairs when the hotel is busy. The food was good and plentiful. It was a nice touch having access to the juice bar at any time during the day and was often just what was needed when coming in from a long day/  Staff - All of the staff were excellent. Nothing was too much trouble and they were always happy to help.   Location - We satyed here for 5 nights and we were after a base to be…,
19,Best stay in NYC yet,Great location to walk to many sites (plays| Empire State Building| Grand Central| excellent shopping on 5th Ave.)| or a cheap cab fare away from wherever you need to be.  The staff were delightful from breakfast servers (free breakfast)| to doormen| concierge - all were wonderful.  The rooms feel more spacious than typical NYC rooms| beds were great (I like firm beds)| the decor perfect| the food in hotel restaurant was delicious - we will be regulars.,
89,Definitely a winning choice!,Great location in terms of access to all of Manhattan| yet out of the tourist madness and noise. Had a suite with juliet balcony.  Room was spacious| separate living room and bedroom with a door is excellent if one of you wants to sleep while the other is up.  Well equipped bathroom| with a small but mighty hair dryer| cotton swabs| cutips| shampoos and moisturizer.   10th floor room facing park ave was very quiet byNYC standards.  The daily breakfast is the best value in town and fuels you for your day.  Croissants and pastries are fabulous| but lots of healthy higher protein choices for the more health concious| also includes espresso and cappucino. Cocktail hour wine and cheese is not fancy| but a nice touch.  All staff is pleasant and courteous.  I would absolutely return to…,
17,Perfect spot for ex-NewYorkers to spend a little family time,Great suite for a group of 4 to stay. Perfect area for walking to and fro. Went to adjacent restaurant( Bread and Tulip) on very rainy Friday night and were very pleased for the experience.Food was of very high quality and imagination and the dining room is very comfortable and warm.,
96,Suite perfect for our family of three,From the pre-stay welcome email to the departing taxi| we cannot really fault the Giraffe. We stayed in the Terrace Suite for a week| which had a separate sitting area with sofa bed for our teenage daughter. The beds were comfortable| the sheets of good quality| and the nightly chocolate a treat. The breakfast was so much more than hard boiled eggs and pastries| but also yoghurt| muesli/cereal| fresh fruit salad| bagels| variety of toasts| juice| and not bad coffee (comparatively speaking). To sit with an evening wine| cheeses| nuts and olives| was a pleasure after a hard day sightseeing. Walk across Madison Park to Eataly for dinner| or any other nearby dining. Finally| all staff were pleasant| helpful and thoroughly professional. We would certainly choose the Giraffe again.,
39,Nice Hotel| but not great,We just returned from a 4 night stay with our 2 kids.  We stayed in a room with 2 double beds.  It was very clean and tidy| but the beds were hard.  It is a bit out of the way ( we thought it was closer to Union Square ) but it is next to Eataly and Madison Park has a charming playground and the Shake Shack.  I only gave it a 3 because the staff just didn't seem to know much about anything. We arrived late ( 11 a.m.) and needed dinner but the hotel staff didn't have one take out menu!!!  They also didn't seem to know hoe to get tickets to a Knicks game| or much of anything else.  Luckily| we have been to NYC many times so we can figure things out| but it's hard to imagine that front desk staff can be so unhelpful.,
43,good amenities but hard beds,we stayed here this time in NYC to be in walking distance to our daughter's apartment.  Usually we stay in a Hilton chain concept as I am a gold member.  I am used to their beds.  This hotel caters to Europeans apparently as the beds were VERY firm/hard and I did not sleep well.  My husband prefers this bed so he did well.  It is nice to have breakfast in the lobby although other than hard boiled eggs it is standard continental fare| not the european breakfast of meat/cheese type - even so you save a lot of money that way.  Happy hour with wine/cheese was nice at night and pianist was a nice touch - this is only during week though which is odd. One elevator was out during our stay for 3 days| and all we got was an apology- no room discount offered or anything - overall a 3| but …,
3,Giraffe stands above the crowd,The Hotel Giraffe is large enough to have ample amenitites and small enough to have an intimate ambiance. The king room is sizeable and well appointed with a balcony overlooking Park. Over the weekend there were two excelllent concierges who did not fail in securing us some fantastic restaurant recommendations. The complimentary breakfast and afternoon happy hour had a little something for everyone. One elevator was out of service and the other was temperamental| which were the only drawbacks to our experience. We plan to stay here again.,
17,Nice Hotel,Great Location| very nice property centrally located in Midtown on Park av. right by Madison Park| Eataly for fun and my fav- ABC carpet and home. Friendly attentive service.  Would stay again.  Room clean and nicely appointed with nice towels/linens.  Beautiful roof top area and room cute with little balcony/sitting area/bedroom.  Liked coming back to happy hour and waking to breakfast.  No wine and cheese on Sunday though.,
52,Great Choice!,I traveled to NYC on business so needed to stay in this area. Great location and very nice property| small boutique hotel with friendly and attentive professional staff. Not overly fancy| just great service and accomodations. Rooms very nice| clean and roomy. Modern feel and updated finishes. Breakfast and Happy Hour in lobby were a blessing to the beginning and ending of my hectic work days. I would highly recommend this property. I would definitely stay here again when coming to NYC.,
58,A central Manhattan gem,My family love this New York hotel| The Giraffe. We've stayed there as a couple at least half a dozen times| and with family and friends as well. It's not too big| nor too small| and it's a real gem in a city with thousands of hotels of all sizes and types.  The Giraffe is very centrally located on Park Avenue South| some 9 blocks up from Union Square in mid town Manhattan. There are excellent shops nearby| in Union Square itself| and on Madison and 5th Avenues| both very near. Madison Square Gardens| less than 5 minutes walk away| has| in our view| the best burgers in New York| at the Shake Shack| and also the wonderful Italian shopping and eating experience| Eataly.  The Giraffe is a very friendly and comfortable hotel. The staff are always charming and most welcoming. The…,
1,Great Boutique Hotel for families,We have stayed at the Giraffe many times over the years. We have always found the hotel to be the best small hotel for families in NYC. The suites are fairly large| the staff is superb| and the breakfast and afternoon snack/wine spread are very nice for both adults and kids. It is also a great location that is away from the very touristic areas and close to great neighborhoods.,
32,Favorite so far,Have spent many weekends in NYC over the years and we like to stay at different places each time.  This place is our new favorite.  It was perfect in every way....friendly| accommodating staff| clean rooms| great location| good price that included breakfast and cocktail hour each evening.  And| they even gave me a pass to the NYAC down the street.  We will definitly stay here again.,
347,Loved this hotel!,I spent many hours searching for a place to stay for our weekend with friends in NYC last fall| and settled on Hotel Giraffe. I was very nervous| since I had picked it for not only me and my husband| but also for 3 other couples. We all thought it was perfect! The staff was great| the rooms were great| the wine and cheese hour was great| and the breakfast was great! It was all the little things that they did that added up to making us feel very welcome. I can not recommend this hotel highly enough!,
6,best hotel ever,i love this hotel. i loved the wine and cheese at 5. we went there during the blizzard in 2010. so when we came in and they got us dinner.,
7,Hotel Giraffe was a WONDERFUL place to stay on our Honeymoon,I had been to NYC on two different occasions and was looking for a place to stay on my honeymoon. I looked and looked with no luck when my travel agent suggested the Hotel Giraffe. So I decided to book this great little hotel for six nights and was not disappointed. My wife and I teach school for a living and are by no means wealthy| but for six nights we were treated like royalty. The people at this hotel were WONDERFUL!!!! I have NEVER stayed in a hotel that treated me as well as the folks at Hotel Giraffe. But the positives do not stop there. The rooms were very very clean.  The rose petals on the bed and the wine and strawberries were a nice touch for this honeymoon couple. The only concern I had going in was there was not a hot breakfast| but the breakfast proved to be very…,
17,Great Hotel; Great Location,Hotel Giraffe is a very classy modern New York boutique hotel done in a French style.  The interior is elegant and spotlessly clean.  I like the location on West 26th Street and Park Avenue South because you are able to look out over a boulevard but enjoy peace and quiet in a somewhat residential area.  (Madison Square Park is just a block away.)  Also| the location is convenient if you wish to go further downtown but also if you wish to go to the theatre district or midtown.  The staff is professional and unobtrusive.  I thought the hotel rates were reasonable.  In short| I highly recommend this hotel as giving the perfect New York experience.,
5,Great| upscale place to stay,We just stayed here for the first time on 1/29/12. The hotel was in a good location but enough out of the way that there was not much noise or hustle and bustle so it was very relaxing. Check in/out was quick and easy. The room was beautiful. It was my birthday and the hotel gave us a free bottle of wine. The staff was very accommodating. There is a beautiful lobby with free refreshments and in the morning there was a complimentary breakfast. Our experience was very positive and I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again. And the price was reasonable for a nice hotel in NYC as well.,
108,This is your place. Stop looking and book now.,Hotel Giraffe was rated #5 of 432 hotels on Trip Advisor when we visited. And now I know why. The service: impeccable. The rooms: more spacious than most NYC hotel rooms| superbly clean| uniquely furnished and all the amenities you need. The beds: counting sheep not required. The location: perfectly set in between the north and south ends of Manhattan so you can quickly get to Soho or Times Square. The extras: free wifi| free breakfast and a concierge that makes magic happen. We called very late the evening before our departure and asked if it was at all possible to have a cab or car pick us up at 5:45 the next morning. They have partnered with a car service and not only was a vehicle waiting it was a full service limo - taxes| tip and tolls included for less than $80 to JFK.…,
8,Fantastic Hotel,Hotel Giraffe is a really great hotel. I've stayed there a few times now and plan to stay there on all my subsequent visits to New York. The staff is great - very friendly and accommodating. The rooms are very clean and have all the amenities you could ask for. And the location is great. And I can't recommend more highly the spiral ham in the restaurant next door.,
1,Great Boutique Hotel,Location was near lots of very good restaurants| 5pm Wine/Cheese/Piano bar| Great continental breakfast (free) and modern room with plenty of working space.  Staff very friendly| especially front door and ladies who took care of breakfast and wine bar.  Ate at the attached resturant twice - very good!  Only complaint was that the maid kept moving my trash can to the other side of the room - it has to be there| I guess.  I can live with that - highly recommend. Motorized blinds on the view window - neat.....,
80,Marriott Courtyard-esque with fancy name,Title says it all.  Not bad for out-of-towners but we got sucked in thinking it was more of a boutique than it was.  I wouldn't go back but I'm sure someone else might appreciate it's pedestrian manner.,
8,Small King room; Big on Class,The room was very small| but the large picture window with a city veiw made up for it. The staff was very kind| and willing to do whatever was needed to make my stay enjoyable. The wine service was unexpected| but welcomed by my business partners in travel.,
8,Great mid-winter deal at lovely hotel,This little gem of a hotel offers very good service and well-appointed rooms (excellent lighting| spotlessly clean| great beds + two desks in double room) near Chelsea. Loved the generous continental breakfast and wine + cheese reception. Nearby Dos Caminos was a fun| lively recommendation from the front desk even on a rainy Monday night. No problem leaving bags for the day. I liked that hotel staff was willing to multi-task to serve guests. And best of all| an on-line rate of $255 was reasonable and all-inclusive! Will be back.,
13,Friendly staff| impeccable hotel,We have stayed at the Hotel Giraffe several times and it is a stand out experience for New York City.  The hotel is impeccably clean| comfortable and conveniently located.  The rooms are unique in that many offer small balconies over looking Park Ave with floor to ceiling windows.  Yet the rooms are strikingly quiet. The complimentary continental breakfast and afternoon refreshments make the hotel an inviting respite before or after business or touring. But what makes the hotel stand out among its peers is the friendly and warm staff.  On one stay we were moving our daughter into her college dorm and the staff helped with storing large bags we sent in advance| making sure we had help with the move in| providing advice on local shops for her to buy things she needed for her dorm…,
18,Big birthday in the city,We loved this elegant small hotel. Nice location with easy access to all the high points. 2 metro stops nearby. Charming place| very well put together. Nice breakfast plus wine/cheese....many days we just ate one meal out at noon. Staff was very personable| in particular Jose. Beautiful rooms. And a complimentary bottle of wine for my birthday!,
1,"True Meaning of ""Accommodation""",I wanted my bachelorette party to be in NYC for a fun weekend getaway. Most of us flew in on a Friday morning from various parts of the country| and our rooms were understandably not ready yet. So we were able to have breakfast and hang out in the lobby. We were impressed with them immediately| and the service only got better from there.  Travelling with a large group of young women is difficult enough| but how the staff accommodated us was outstanding. They were very patient with us| and knowing it was a special occasion for me they went above and beyond.  Some highlights:  - Location is great - The cocktail reception is a really nice touch - Rooms are very comfortable  I have nothing bad to say about this hotel| I will definitely stay there again!,
139,Nice get away for couples,If you just want to be alone away from it all for a romantic week-end| this is a good choice. It is right around the corner from 11 Madison Park| which is the great restaurant of the neighborhood| so a late dinner there followed by a retreat to the hotel is a good combination.,
9,Very Nice Hotel!,I will keep this short and to the point:  Hotel Giraffe has a great| helpful staff. The rooms are extremely well laid out and every inch of space is well used.  It is located in a fantastic part of Manhattan.  We could have not done better.  I plan to return to Giraffe each time we travel to Manhattan. Rooms are quiet and housekeeping is superb.  Dave Zachau,
10,Faultless,Our expectations were met in every way. Having done a lot of research particularly on Trip Advisor we were happy with this hotel from the moment of arrival with a very helpful front desk right through to our departure after five great nights over Christmas. On a couple of occasions the tables were fully occupied at Breakfast but this soon cleared. Location is superb for accessing everthing tourists need. Cabs and subway are great and walk as much as you can to nearby places. Recommend The ShakeShack in Madison Square Park and Eataly both of which are close. We also prepaid in advance direct to the Hotel to obtain a discount on the tariff.,
142,Lovely hotel!,Stayed here with family in town - the extended family loved it!  The staff was very friendly and approachable - also knowledgeable about things to do in the city and where to go.  The rooms are a good size| plus having a balcony is so nice.  Room/bathroom was clean and modern and lovely.  The lobby has a nice atmosphere - so nice to sit and relax away from the bustle of the city!  Had a wonderful stay and would recommend this hotel.,
5,New York 4-10th Jan 2012,Booked the Giraffe on recommendations of previous reviewers and found the midtown Giraffe had an ideal location. Impressed with the quiet intimacy that this place offers. Great cheese and wine evening offering; great way to kick off the evening or to unwind at end of sight-seeing day. Stayed in one bedroom terrace suite whcih| by NYC standards| offered great value. Request for high floor room with fridge was met. Will be back for sure.,
90,Very| very good.,I have stayed at the Giraffe for business and with family and for a girls' weekend. The service is wonderful and the rooms are clean and fairly well-appointed. It's not overly exciting nor do I find it that special| but I would not hesitate to return. I think my biggest criticism is that some of the rooms are dark. When I have stayed on an upper floor| facing Park Ave.| it has been lovely (and surprisingly quiet.) The happy hour is a nice amenity| and the location| in my opinion| can't be beat. You can jump on the 6 to get downtown| or hop right over to Madison Square Park and head towards Flatiron district and lower 5th. I have stayed in several hotels throughout the years in NY and for business I am willing to take a risk and try for a a hipper hotel but not when I am…,
975,Ideal hotel for NYC stay,"Great boutique hotel in NYC.  Ideal location| close to everything. Nice decour| also free breakfast and snacks/coffee/ cheese wine in the evenings help save some money.  Any trip to NYC| you'lle end up dropping some cash. I used to live in NYC- location is ideal-if you like to walk-Theater district| Union Square| East village are all easy walks. Some great Indian restaurants in this area--back in the day this was ""Little India"".  While shrinking away| you can still find some good food options. Nice rooftop outdoor lounge. One draw back is the views are are not the best. Also no vents in the bathroom| so mirrors steamed up easily.  .",
7,Delightful!,On a recent weekend in NYC I was looking for a reasonably prices hotel. My travel agent recommended the Giraffe.i found this hotel to be a most delightful surprise. Wonderful staff| incredibly comfortable bed. And very quiet even though I was on the 3rd floor.,
68,The perfect weekend,What a terrific weekend we had at the Hotel Giraffe. From the second we walked in| we were made to feel at home by the staff. They greeted us with glasses of wine| which we enjoyed while we settled into the room. The Terrace Suite was cozy but roomy| and the terrace view was exquisite. The bedroom and sitting room were beautifully decorated and extremely clean. The continental breakfast was terrific and every member of the staff that we encountered was friendly| helpful and courteous. They kindly watched over our bags even after we checked out so we could enjoy more of the city| and the location couldn't have been better. So many great restaurants| stores and cool| historic places nearby. All in all| a perfect getaway.,
140,Nice weekend getaway,My Fiance wanted a weekend getaway. I heard of this hotel from friends and always wanted to try it. We arrived at 5:00 PM to a happy hour with wine| cheese and other food. The room was nice. They turn down your bed at night and play soothing music. They even offer a free breakfast which we did not have. The hotel is close to the subway and many nice areas in Manhattan.,
19,Comfort and the city...,"A great place to enjoy a rest in NYC : friendly staff| comfortable room| convenient location. Ok| find a seat to have breakfast can be difficult during rush hours but ""do not worry| be happy""!",
95,This is a Great Hotel,In a city of fine hotels| this hotel stands out in my opinion.  It is centrally located and provides easy access to everything in NY.  The hotel itself has great amenities starting with the free continental breakfast and ending with the complimentary wine and cheese in the evening.  The rooms are exceptional and the staff is always courteous and gracious.  The room decor is high quality and they try to make your stay as comfortable as possible. I highly recommend this hotel.,
24,wonderful stay,Great hotel| great staff. We enjoyed everything about it.,
1,Classy but not pretentious,Used to live in NYC and am highly wary of most hotels. Husband works in the hotel industry so our expectations are high. This hotel was clean| classy| and all around great! Staff were awesome and free breakfast was lovely! Highly recommend this hotel!,
237,Great service but...,.... The hotel has a capacity problem. A couple of times we had to had breakfast standing up becuase there was no sitting space left. Same problem with cheese and wine.A couple of times there was nowhere to sit... For the rate they are charging this is pretty unacceptable. rooms are ok but not great. Quite small as it is the norm in most Manhattan hotels. The worst| however| is the restaurant attached to the hotel --the socalled Bread and Tulips. this is the worst restaurant I have been for a long time with terrible food and poor service. the hotel offered us a voucher with 20 per cent discount... it is a shame that the Giraffe Hotel is related to such a restaurant and encourages clients to go there!!! But I agree that the best part of the hotel is the outstanding service. the…,
26,Christmas getaway,Wanted to take my husband to Maialino for dinner as a Christmas gift| and found the PERFECT hotel within 5 blocks| on Park Avenue South.  Walking distance from Grand Central| too.  Beautiful hotel| VERY clean and quiet| lovely welcome| including a complimentary room upgrade which was a nice surprise.  We'd stay here again in a heartbeat.,
15,Christmas 2011 visit,Spent four nights in Hotel Giraffe end December 2011. Excellent hotel close to all amenities. Laptop in Foyer to print off Boarding Passes excellent idea. Cheese and Wine reception with Piano each evening really enjoyable. Will be back!!!,
74,Home in NY,I spent four nights at this little gem on Park Avenue with my family over the Christmas period.It has an ideal location on Park Avenue| quiet affording the tired traveller some respite from the bustle of the city and yet only a ten minute walk to the 23rd Subway Station where you can catch the N or R line to places like Times Square|Radio City Hall| Rockefeller Centre. Taxis are really easy to flag down outside the hotel and are really a good alternative to travel around in.The rooms are really comfortable and provide complimentary wireless internet.Coming back in the evening after a long day of sightseeing| and you will be welcomed by a complimentary wine and cheese session and a pianist playing Christmas favourites.Tired? and you head back to your room and pleasantly surprised…,
78,What a great surprise !,When I thought that all NY hotel rooms were small and dark I found Hotel Giraffe with its modern| big| clean rooms with very high ceilings and natural plants in every room. What a great surprise| I will never go elsewhere. Service is exceptionnal from the cleaning lady to the very helpful employees at the front desk to the doormen.  Breakfast is simple but with very high quality food. Hard to find great croissants but they are delicious at the Giraffe ! We really enjoyed the cocktail hour with wine| cheese and a very good music with a piano player.,
1,New Years Eve A++,Hotel Giraffe was a very nice hotel I stayed at over new years. The rooms are beautiful| they gladly upgraded us to a bigger room when we asked| Ashton and Franklin who work at the front desk were very helpful with suggesting places close by to eat and helping us navigate the city. I highly recommend others to stay here! Wonderful new years thanks to the hotel giraffe ,
205,TheBest,I have raved many times about this wonderful hotel. I probably shouldn't. It's hard to get reservations. This time the service was superb as always| from Melvin to the night housekeeping staff. Friendly| warm people. Rooms are clean and beds are comfortable with crisp Frette sheets. Can't rave enough. It's the best in Manhattan.  thesidetrek.com,
7,Don't be tricked by them,I booked my stay online as I do with many other hotels.  I gave them my credit card to hold the room but charged my card for my stay a month in advance.  Their website implied a 20% savings if you pre-pay for your stay.  Read the fine print before you give them your credit card information.  Additionally| my traveling companion was ill and bedridden the last two days of our stay.  I requested a later checkout in order to prevent him from having to sit in the lobby before our car arrived but they were no willing to accommodate us.   Because of their attitude that I was SOL| I wound suggest other hotels.  There are many great hotels in the city.  I've stayed in many and they are all much more accommodating than Hotel Giraffe,
23,Weekend away,Stayed at the Giraffe for a shopping long weekend away with girlfriends.  The hotel is in a great location and service is impeccable.  Previously we had stayed at Eventi which is around the corner. I found the rooms a bit tired when comparing to a hotel like the Eventi (which is very new so likely isn't showing age yet).  The room we stayed in did not offer a great view even though we had a higher floor| just views of other buildings and it felt very enclosed.  Make sure to request a room where you might get some light. We stayed in a room with a sitting area which was lovely and provided the extra space we required.  The bathroom however is very tiny relative to the ones at Eventi. The breakfast buffet was fantastic and this was the reason we chose this hotel over staying at…,
83,Great hotel and great neighborhood,Our hotel stay was great from the moment we arrived. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The suite in which we stayed was clean and well appointed. The sitting area really is a separate room and the bedroom has a door| so it was easy to set our kids up with their own private space in the sitting area. The free continental breakfast is nice| as is the wine and cheese in the afternoon. Bread and Tulips| the restaurant next door| has a limited menu and is not that kid friendly. There are many nice looking restaurants within a few blocks though. The hotel is a short two blocks from the 6 line| making for easy travel to anywhere from Chinatown to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Checkout is late (1pm)| which meant that on our last day| we still could fit in a morning activity…,
61,Great experience at a very crowded time of year!,We have stayed in every type of hotel in NYC.  We have 3 kids| so that is tough for us in NY because the rooms typically only sleep four.  We've stayed on the upper west side| midtown| upper east side ( well around 59th)| and at the Affinia by Penn Station (MSG)..we have stayed in large hotels| Marriott Marquis| and small boutiquey hotels| and places like the Phillips Club.  So we know what to expect when we go to NY| small rooms|high prices| bad service| dirty showers| uncomfortable beds| waiting forever for an elevator| well you can fill in the rest.   So this time (Christmas time) I wanted to check more of the downtown areas| Chelsea Market| Soho| etc..and we looked online and found Hotel Giraffe| it had good reviews| but I was still skeptical.  Hotel Giraffe is located on…,
43,Happy in Manhattan,beautiful room| big for NY.  Very clean.  Super friendly front desk and doormen. very helpful with dinner reservations and directions. Complimentary wine and cheese in the lobby at 5pm.  very comfortable and relaxing lobby.  Convenient to subway.  couldn't ask for much more than that!,
125,Great Experience!,My wife and I spent one night at the Hotel Giraffe. From the second we arrived| it was an excellent experience. We were greeted at our car and our bags whisked inside. The check in process was short and easy. While checking in| we scoped out the lobby. While it looks small at first| there is sufficient room to spread out and relax with a complimentary juice or coffee. The one item that was a little hokey was the hotel provided laptop to the left of the front door. I understand you need to provide a computer for guest usage and that space is limited| but there has got to be a better way to present that area.   The room had an excellent amount of space| especially when you compare it to other NYC hotels. As we were celebrating a special occasion| the hotel staff had left a nice…,
69,Amazing service,The hotel room was excellent.  We came her for our honeymoon and was not disappointed.  We were greeted with a gentleman opening the door for us.  The complimentary wine and cheese each evening was made even more special with the live piano music.  The breakfast too was out of this world. Great selection. Would highly recommend this place to anyone.,
43,Loved this gem of a hotel.,Just returned from a five day trip to New York City with our two daughters| and this little hotel won our hearts. The front desk| door men| service staff| turn-down staff - all of them were attentive| warm and pleasant. The room is on small side| but it is NYC| and there is lots of desk space to utilize. Two sinks in the bathroom would be nice but we made do just fine with the one. The complimentary coffee| tea and lemonade is a small thing but makes a big difference when you are in a the city in the winter and don't want to have to get dressed to march down a busy street to find the nearest Starbucks. The morning continental breakfast was also much appreciated since our teenage daughters were on a different sleep schedule than my husband and I were - so we were able to…,
125,Great retreat in the hustle and bustle of NY,We are regular visitors to NY and know how much of a difference a decent hotel makes.  Hotel Giraffe was the perfect choice for our family.  We stayed in a terrace suite that connected to a double/double for our 4 kids.  11th floor with great views.  The hotel felt very intimate and upscale.  Staff was very professional and helpful. Beds were super comfortable.  Complimentary amenities such as bottled water are a rarity in NY.  As is the complimentary breakfast and evening reception.  The only slight drawback for some people may be the distance to main attractions such as Times Square.  For those relcutant to walk that far| it is easy to catch the subway or a cab.  Would definitely go back.,
3,Holiday in NYC,We have stayed at the Giraffe several times. the staff is always great| especially Melvin. The breakfast and evening social are fun and very high quality. The Giraffe is a short txi ride from all of the fun things to do in NYC.,
193,Excellent location| amenities and service,On previous trips to NY we have stayed in Times Square| which has great subway access| but is a zoo.  Hotel Giraffe is in a quieter area| yet it turned out to be an excellent location.  You could easily walk to Greenwich Village or Chelsea or take a short subway ride to SoHo or up to the Met.  We asked for an upper floor room| which we had read about on TripAdvisor.  My husband expressed his disappointment when the room was across from the elevator on the second floor| so they upgraded us to the suite on the same floor.  In fairness to the hotel| it isn't big and there was a wedding going on that weekend so it was fully booked.  The suite was lovely and the street noise wasn't an issue at all.  The breakfast comes with bagels| hard boiled eggs| pastries| etc. and was plenty. …,
20,GREAT HOTEL!,This was my first visit to this hotel which was booked by my office and at first I was a little apprehensive going by the name| but when I checked out the reviews on trip advisor I was quite certain that I would enjoy my stay and all my expectations were fully met.,
25,Absolutely lovely and spotless!,Free breakfast could use a boost| but the people and property were perfect!,
9,Excellant | excellant,If your looking for a lovely hotel| a diamond in the rough| the Hotel Giraffe should be your destination. The rooms were lovely| the staff was fantastic and the stay was special.  The complimentary breakfast and afternoon tea were very above average and substantively more than I expected. I would recommend it highly and will return.,
165,Excellent Boutique Experience in New York,"I have stayed at the Giraffe on several occasions| most recently this fall.  I have been very impressed by the quality of the guestrooms and the personal service of the staff.  At 70 or so rooms| it's an intimate place by New York standards.  They offer a nice breakfast in the morning and an evening happy hour in the lobby. It's on Park Avenue -- a little off the main tourist areas but an easy walk to the Flatiron District.  This is our ""Go To"" hotel in New York| and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a more personalized hotel experience in NYC.",
2,An Oasis in the Middle of Manhattan,My two sisters and I took our mother to New York for her 75th birthday and we booked four nights at this lovely Manhattan hotel based largely on its TripAdvisor rating. We were not disappointed. It totally lived up to its high ranking and we were very impressed by every aspect. Our suite was a good size and was set up well to accommodate several people. We also loved the free breakfast every morning.   An example of the excellent service: We arrived back at the Giraffe in a cab on a rainy evening and the door man came over with an umbrella for my mother to escort her from the cab into the hotel. Additionally| they made a point of acknowledging my mother's birthday while we were there by sending a thoughtful little gift up to our room.  It's a small hotel and even when full never…,
10,a hidden gem!,A great hotel tucked away on the corder of 26th and Park.     Everything about this place was perfect.  Convenient location| beautiful building| attentive staff.  Looking forward to another stay in the near future.,
31,Great stay,Had six nights in this lovely| welcoming and great situated hotel. All staff members were very friendly and helpful. The room was a fair size with nice little touches. We even had a set of scales in the bathroom. Maybe not exactly what you want when on holiday but great for weighing the cases after shopping. Great double glazing too as it was very quiet. Great seating area on the roof. We never used it but went up to have a look and could imagine sitting up there in warmer weather with your wine and cheese biscuits which are complimentary 5pm to 8. Although there is a subway just round the corner we were able to walk to all the places we wanted to visit as you are quite central. Having travelled to the hotel by train from the airport we decided to treat ourselves to a car for…,
65,A good experience,I stayed at Giraffe on business for three nights arriving late on a Sunday night.  I got a great welcome and lots of information about the hotel (which I think would have been better written down).  The staff were very friendly| the room was a decent size and clean.  Unfortunately some of the bed linen was missing (the duvet undersheet) which I only noticed the following morning.  Upon returning to the hotel after a 14 hour day at work I asked if there was a bar (for a drink and snack) and the girl at reception informed me there wasn't so i went up to my room to explore room service.  The manager however had overheard and knocked on my door bringing me a complimentary glass of wine to say sorry.  Overall a very good experience.,
1,Wow,Having stayed in many of the upmarket (& very expensive) boutique brands in NYC we were looking forward to the very highly reviewed and rated Giraffe. It did not disappoint - on any level. Terrific central location| exceptional cheerful staff and enormous (by NYC measures) room (1 bed suite) Lots of added touches that really make a difference - on tap coffee 24 hrs a day in reception| daily nibbles at 5pm and a superb breakfast in the lobby. Room was vast| clean and quiet. All the features you could want. The Giraffe is a real find and I can't imagine staying elsewhere. Fantastic 5 nights thank you,
61,relaxed and friendly atmosphere,We stayed 4 nights over the Thanksgiving weekend. The hotel is nice and comfortable and has a good location for sightseeing and shopping. Maybe I expected a little bit more 'wow' for the price we paid but it was my first time in NY| so maybe it's because I haven't got any comparison! The room was pleasantly quiet.The size of the double bed is a bit disappointing as it is really very small. Suffering from jetlag we had to return to the hotel one afternoon to have a nap only to find the room not cleaned at 2pm| never mind that but after putting the 'do not disturb' on door we later receive a call to let us know they need to clean... what is the point of having a 'not disturb' sign then I wonder...? Breakfast is really lovely| the fruit wonderfully fresh but after 2 days you do…,
43,another good stay BUT lock your own property,it was our second stay at the giraffe.. and it was a nice week . the front desk staff have always been nice and helpful| as well as all the personnel. in the afternoon they have a nice buffet with wine and cheese.  But|this year i have a but; beware travellers I am missing some painkillers with codeine medication like u.s. tylenol 3 and they were not on the table to everyone to see but well kept in my luggage. Fortunately i did not need those medication. I understand that you cannot control the behaviour of all the employes and these kind of medication have an huge market..and maybe this could have happened in any other hotel...still.. next time i will put them in the safe. You are warned.,
12,PERFECT NY STAY!!,Agree with all the great things said about Hotel Giraffe... our visit 11/25-11/29 was nothing short of perfect.  From the amenities| rooms| happy hour| roof terrace and most important ... the staff ... it was a perfect stay.  Special thanks to Brenden and all the other Giraffe team who went out of their way to make this a fabulous visit!   After long days of visiting this great city| returning to Giraffe was just magnificent... from the wine/cheese happy hour to GREAT nights sleep in our beautiful room.... the bed is nothing short of dreamland for a great nights sleep!   We have stayed at many 5 star hotels| yet Giraffe stands tall among all the places we've stayed.  Many thanks for an unforgettable experience. We will return!!!   Blaine and Donna,
1,A Perfect Wedding Weekend,Hotel Giraffe exceeded all of my expectations!  With the help of our onsite coordinator| Emily White| we were able to plan a destination wedding from South Korea in a 6 week period of time and our wedding reception was absolutely perfect.  Emily worked hand in hand with me and with our wedding coordinator to make sure that every detail was covered.  Emily was in touch almost daily to remind me of decisions that needed to be made| help advise on things that I may not have considered or just to let me know what she had taken care of that day.  She was outstanding.  Emily was even onsite and at my reception for the entire evening.  I did not have to worry about anything.      The food at our reception was handled by Bread & Tulips which is the restaurant inside the hotel.  We were…,
7,An exceptional experience,Excellent location| especially for a first visit to NY: right in the middle of everything. Room is very comfortable. All around service was definitely very good and always friendly. Free cocktails and cheese after many miles of walking was very appreciated. Breakfast was exceptional for a small hotel. My wife and I would certainly repeat this pleasant experience.,
39,We Love the Giraffe!,We stayed at the Giraffe for a week.  The young staff were amazing-friendly| very helpful and altogether impressive.  It was good value| very comfortable and the housekeeping was spot on.  We will certainly return to the Giraffe for our next visit to New York City.,
228,Boutique? Rather plain vainilla,The location is excellent. Right between Midtown and easy short walk to Greenwich Village and forther down to SoHo. Service is friendly and caring giving the impression that guest are not only welcome but they need to have all the service and amenities expected. The free cocktails and cheese in the evening and breakfast in the morning are a nice touch. However| I would not call it a Boutique Hotel. Rather plain vanilla| solid and honest quality. Rooms are well appointed but not soundproof. The little balconies dont do much in Manhatten. Try to avoid the rooms facing Park Avenue South - very loud in evening and early in the morning. You pay a rather steep price for what you get - but then this is Manhattan with hefty room taxes.,
46,Practically Perfect in Every Way,My wife and I spent three nights in this delightful hotel and couldn't have been happier.  The staff is very helpful and friendly| the room well appointed and the location outstanding.  There are great restaurants in every direction and because this isn't a tourist area none of them is touristy or schlocky.  There is a subway station two blocks away and plenty of cabs cruising by.  The breakfast is yummy and ample and served in a excellent street-level people-watching location.  We couldn't have been more pleased.,
71,Our new home in New York,Perfect for us  Not stupidly expensive  Friendly  Nice rooms  Love the wine| cheese| biscuits and tinkly piano  Desperately looking forward to nest time| hopefully next year,
76,great little hotel,My husband and I spent a week at the giraffe in Novemeber. The location was great. Easy to get to from JFK about 30 mins in a yellow taxi for a set price of $45. Most of the metro were between a 5 and 10 minute walk away so very easy to get around. We got a weekly subway card for $27 which was excellent value for money if using the subway and buses. Our hotel room was lovely| not large but for a big city it was a good size. The room had everything you needed including a fridge| bath| ironing board and hairdryer. We were more than happy with the very nice breakfasts and enjoyed the free wine and cheese in the evenings. The hotel was busy due to marathon week but apart from it being busy at breakfast on some of the mornings| we found the hotel very peaceful. I asked for a quieter…,
3,My Favorite Hotel in NYC,I can't say enough about this hotel.  This is the only place I will stay while in the city.  Probably the most hospitable staff of any hotel Ive visited.  If you ever have the opportunity to stay here please do so.  You will not be disappointed!  I took my niece to New York for her 14th birthday and wanted her to have an experience that she would never forget.  As usual| they exceeded my expectations.  Special thanks to Pablo| Franklin and Ashton for accommodating all of our requests.,
3,Loved this hotel and would definitely stay here again!,I have stayed in many NY hotels of all price and star ratings.  The Hotel Giraffe was great-all newish bathrooms and fixtures in rooms.  Lovely linens| quiet. Decent size room.  I never heard anyone in the rooms near me at all.  I stayed for 3 nights and they were so nice.  I arrived on Saturday morning on the redeye and they actually gave me my room at 10 am and upgraded it to a king instead of queen.  Needless to say I was thrilled as I know that it is always questionable if a hotel will do this.  They were quite nice about it and I was super happy.  I also had told them when I made the reservation that I wanted a mini refrigerator in the room and they brought that up to the room without me even reminding them.  And finally| I had told them when I made the reservation that I…,
11,Brilliant stay,Lovely hotel. Front desk staff were extremely helpful and friendly and we got all details about internet access and other information when we arrived. Room excellent and very comfortable. Good breakfasts in well appointed lounge area and free wine and nibbles in the early evenings. Brilliant position for visiting the sights of NYC. Top drawer.,
3,The name that made them giggle.......,"I said| ""Hotel What?....Giraffe?  We walked in rubbing our eyes. A little travel weary. Doors held open by bright| smiling| friendly faces. Warm personalities at the desk| and a beautifully designed and kept lobby with hot coffee and biscotti visible and offered to us.  The Bellman was preoccupied so the front desk clerk himself insisted on taking our luggage to our room and escorting us with charming mirth and friendly recommendations.  This| in short| sets the scene for the entire 3 night stay.  The rooms are luxurious and spot clean.  Free WiFi throughout the building. We were asked several times by the other guests visiting town for our wedding party where we were staying. When we told them| The name made them giggle. We felt compelled to quickly share all the above every…",
45,Average hotel| nothing special.  Needs better service,After reading the TripAdvisor reviews| you would think that this is a special hotel.  It is not.  It is very average with the exception that the service is below average.  The front desk staff was not particularly helpful.  There is no information in the room regarding internet usage| times for breakfast or how to use the health club.  The bed was hard and the elevators were frequently slow.  This morning| as a large group gathered waiting for an elevator| the front desk people huddled together| not acknowledging the problem.  We ended up taking the stairs.  When we decided to check out 2 days early| the front desk representative didn't even ask why| but informed us that there was a $100 charge for checking out early.  Read what they ask you to sign when you check in because the…,
159,Two great stays,We have twice stayed at the Giraffe for a short| five day| visit to New York.  This hotel is part of a small chain and all the hotels continually rank high on TA.  We haven't tried any of the others as our first stay at the Giraffe was so good that was the first place we thought about booking when we went back| and we weren't disappointed.    The pros and cons.  The hotel| in our opinion| has an excellent location.  It is away from the overly touristed areas such as Times Square and Central Park| but at the same time extremely well located to visit all of the areas.  It is very close to the Metro and while in the centre of town| relatively quiet (by New York standards).  The location makes for reasonably priced taxi rides when you are too tired for another metro ride.   While…,
44,We'd stay here again,Stayed for 5 days at the Hotel Giraffe| with four of our friends. The staff were fantastic always willing to help or to place calls for us. Unfortuately for us we were caught up in the hurricane shut down of New York.  Although the Giraffe were unable to accommodate us over this enforced stay| they did everything they could to ensure we gained accommodation elsewhere. Our rooms were excellant| the staff wonderful and we loved comming back to the hotel at the end of a busy day and being able to just sit| relax and enjoy wine and some nibbles before refreshing and heading out again,
52,Excellent hotel| great location,Stayed here for 7 nights with my husband and 14 year old daughter.  We had a one bedroom suite with my daughter sleeping on the sofa bed in the living area.  Hotel is very comfortable and clean and it was nice to have a bit more space with the living area.  Breakfast was great - not a huge selection but the fresh fruit| bagels and cappuccinos were all good. The wine and nibbles in the evening were a nice way to end a busy day before heading out for dinner.  Very close to subway station for getting uptown or downtown and we enjoyed the neighbourhood restaurants| which were all within walking distance.  Would definately recommend.,
852,Great hotel and perfect location,My family and I stayed at Hotel Giraffe for four nights in October/November. A year ago my wife and stayed in the Hotel Library (NY) that belongs to the same chain of hotels. Both hotels have well deserved very high ratings on Trip Advisor. The rooms in Hotel Giraffe where| however| much bigger than in Hotel Library. Both have excellent breakfasts which (and this I a big plus especially for a European) is included in the price.  In addition| the afternoon small complementary wine buffet is very nice and relaxing. The front desk in both hotels were exceptionally kind and helpful| especially Franklin and Alexandra at the Hotel Giraffe. The first night| meeting Franklin at the front desk| felt like coming home| and Alexandra went ou of her way in helping us when our luggage was…,
46,Friendly and stylish hotel,The level of service in this hotel is exceptional| even by NY standards.  All day service for refreshments with breakfast and cocktail are a lovely touch and the free wifi is very reliable.  The beds and linen are very high quality and make for excellent sleeps. Rooms are showing slight signs of wear and tear and are rather dimly lit| but these are minor quibbles in what is a very good NY hotel.  I've stayed a few times and would definitely return.,
398,Wonderful Hotel,Spent a few nights here between Christmas and New Year 2009/2010 on our first trip to NYC. Wonderful hotel| made the whole experience truly special. Lovely rooms| attentive staff and the evening drinks were a real treat. Fantastic| really hope to re-visit some day.,
22,Absolutely perfect!!!,We stayed at the Hotel Giraffe recently| and it was the most amazing experience we've had in quite sometime! Yes| you get what you pay for- most especially in any big city- and the Hotel Giraffe is quiet| very clean| has a super friendly & accomodating staff| and is in a perfect location. We had a suite with a Juliette balcony on the 5th floor that was just so lovely. The staff welcomed us like we were VIP's| and the complimentary cheese & prosecco in the lobby| as well as breakfast| is the perfect touch! We had the best sleep we've had in a while| as the beds are delicious- I need to know what thread count the sheets were because they were fabulous! Ask for Ashley- she took care of our every whim and helped make this such an enjoyable vacation. The 1PM check out is so…,
7,Fantastic boutique hotel!,My sister and I stayed here for the second time and I cannot recommend it enough.  The hotel staff is such a delight and there are so many small| personal touches that make this hotel so special.  The rooms are very quiet| clean and comfortable and the housekeeping staff  is excellent and efficient.  The complimentary breakfast and wine & cheese gathering each evening is something to look forward to.  The hotel's location is so central but it is also wonderfully quiet in the evenings.  I plan to stay here any time I travel to NYC and look forward to my next visit!,
40,Enjoyed Our Stay,Overall we had a very enjoyable two night stay.  The positives:  every member of the staff we met from door man/front desk/wait staff/maids was welcoming| caring and competent; the breakfast (til 10:30 am!) and happy hour (till 8 pm!) are excellent| the room was spacious| clean and comfortable| the check-out time of 1 o'clock was extremely civilized and the hotel's location was perfect.  Given the overwhelming positives of our stay the negatives seemed minor:  water pressure that occasionally dwindled to a trickle during a shower| the key cards that sometimes work and sometimes don't prompting a trip back downstairs to the desk to get them re-keyed| the sometimes long wait for the elevator (a Victoria Secret Fashion Show was going on next store and the hotel was very crowded)|…,
1,We plan to stay here again,My husband and I stayed four nights at the Hotel Giraffe.  We were extremely pleased with the entire experience.  The room was very clean| stylish and comfortable.  Except for some street noise| it was very quiet - we could not hear other guests. We really liked the hotel location.  It is about 2 blocks from a subway stop and close to several good restaurants.  We ate at both Les Halles (French bistro) and Primehouse (lively steakhouse).  They are both wonderful (but noisy) restaurants. The free breakfast in the morning and wine and cheese in the evening were much appreciated.  Two of the young women who were serving the food and drinks were extremely professional and friendly.  Thank you Laura and Rosaily (sp?)!   All of the staff we encountered was very friendly and helpful. …,
3,1 night Romance Package......excellent!!,We had 1 night at Hotel Giraffe while in NYC and had a romance package as a birthday present. The attention to detail and personal touches were great (chocolate strawberries| champagne and rose petals on the bed).  I also really liked the casual self service approach for breakfast and snacks in the lobby. Was jut my style. Not always a fan of having to use a waiter for simple tasks like coffee and toast.   Thanks for making the day and night special. Regards Robin & Stella,
5,Wonderful Stay!,We had a wonderful experience at the Hotel Giraffe.  The staff was incredibly helpful and very pleasant.  Our room was a wonderfully appointed room that was the perfect size for my husband and I.  At no point did we feel the room was too small or missing anything.  The wine and cheese social each evening was very relaxing and a great opportunity to sit before our evening activities.  The location was wonderful as well as we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go.  We loved the Hotel Giraffe and would definitely consider coming back the next time we come to New York.,
1,Excellent!,We had an excellent stay at Hotel Giraffe. All the hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was very nice. The cheese and wine in the evenings was a really nice extra. I was very surprised about the size of the room| we had a room with 2 double beds which had two desks| an adequate size bathroom| arm chair and plenty of space for luggage and all the shopping we bought. For once the picture of the room on the internet was actually what the room looked liked when we turned up. This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in in New York City.,
141,Small| boutique| pricey,The hotel location is outside the main tourist area but very convenient and well positioned with regard to local transportation.  The room was on the small side but very well appointed.  They have free buffet breakfast which was fine although no hot food| and free drinks and snacks in the afternoon which is a nice touch.  For NY prices| I guess it's not crazy expensive but still pricey. One annoying thing...they have blackout shades (a great idea) however| it was not wide enough to cover the entire window so the light fell right across the pillow (go figga!),
47,Fabulous place to stay in NYC,The Hotel Giraffe staff makes this the perfect place| along with coffee in the AM| drinks & snacks at happy hour| the lobby is a great place to meet up or work.  Nice sized really comfortable rooms| good location| subways close by.  Really great place| many places nearby to eat reasonably| don't miss Eataly - I visit NYC alot for business and this is one of my favorite places to stay!,
2,What a Great NYC Hotel,Back in February| 2011| I visited the Hotel Giraffe when searching for accommodations for out-of-town family and friends for my daughter's wedding on October 15.  I knew the moment I entered the hotel that it was the perfect place.  The understated elegance appealed to me as did the location| size (boutique)| beautifully appointed rooms| and many amenities that are not offered in larger hotels.  The staff was very helpful over the next 8 months in blocking guest rooms| keeping me informed of bookings| and accommodating a last minute request when one of our elderly guests required a handicapped room.  During my one week's stay there| I heard nothing but raves from not only our friends and family| but also from other people staying in the hotel.    Highlights were the comfortable…,
3,Almost perfect!,We had a wonderful time in NYC in this brilliant hotel. Great location in a slightly quieter but still vibrant part of town| plenty of good places to eat locally and very helpful friendly and effective staff. A great base to discover the joys of NYC from.,
12,Fallen in Love...with Giraffe.,We travelled from Australia (Perth) for a special birthday and luckily found the Giraffe - can't stop congratulating ourselves!  Stayed two weeks - great breakfast starter; loved the evening drinks accentuated by a wonderful pianist on the baby grand piano.  Great decor - very good rooms and quiet!!  Location terrific - walked over to Madison Park and then to Eataly (what a find for food and ambiance).  Room a real haven - clean| comfortable and bed and pillows a delight - great to come 'home' to this lovely space.  Staff fantastic and helpful.  Will stay again when passing through NYC in the future.,
12,Loved It Again!,This was my second visit to Hotel Giraffe. First was last fall for my birthday and the recent trip was in August for our anniversary. I cant wait to go back! Room was beautiful| service was excellent. I love the wine & cheese reception. Great way to relax before going out to dinner. My husband & I even got to enjoy the rooftop patio by ourselves for a few drinks! We were starving when we got there so we popped around the corner to Red Sky for a few drinks and apps ~ go there if you want to eat & drink for cheap! Can't wait to come back & visit Hotel Giraffe! Next time I think Im bringing the girls!,
72,Once Again| Terrific,I hesitate to keep giving the Giraffe great reviews. I fear I'll never be able to get a reservation again -- they will be fully booked!  The front desk staff is terrific. The doormen are the best. Next time I am coming for pleasure (rather than business).,
6,Second visit - hope to be back soon.,I stayed 4 nights at the Giraffe with two friends for a girly birthday celebration. Service was friendly and efficient. Room was spotless| well equipped and large by NY standards. Breakfast was just what we needed before setting out for day's sight seeing or shopping and we took full advantage of the cheese and wine reception in the evenings.   The location suited us well  - venturing up or downtown we used the 6 train from the 28th street station which is minutes from the hotel. It's also a nice wander down to Madison Square Park and the Flatiron Building| which is only a couple of blocks. I can't fault Hotel Giraffe at all| and hope to be back again soon.,
259,Nice hotel... a little impersonal,Having come from Casablanca Hotel we were a little disappointed in Hotel Giraffe. The staff are not as friendly| had more of a corporate feel than a friendly welcoming one.  The room – a one bedroom suite – was nice... but the bathroom was small and with the sofa bed down for the 3rd guest - there was little room to move in the ‘lounge area’.  The wine and cheese is a nice touch but as we had a beer drinker amongst us we went instead to the bar where prices were on the expensive side| and the staff were indifferent.  We could see the appeal of this place and it suited our needs but our view of it was affected by our stay at the far superior Casablanca.,
23,Great find in NYC,Loved this Hotel in a great area of New York. The views down Park Ave and 26th St from our 11th floor suite were fantastic. Staff are friendly| approachable and helpful| esp Franklin| who was great with our kids. The breakfasts in the beautiful foyer are handy and perfect for Australian tastes| and the wine and cheese evenings (although we onl;y managed to catch 2 in a week) were brilliant! The rooftop garden is a nice.oasis in the big city. We never used the New York Sport Club passes| but when you are in New York| there are so many better things to do. The neighbourhood is safe to walk around in at all hours| and there are great restaurants locally(including as specialised as several kosher vegetarian Indian places on Lexington!). Would return here in a flash| although am keen…,
